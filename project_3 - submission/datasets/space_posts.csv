space,"People old enough may remember the late 80's Reagan / Ed Teller era, when the USA tried to create orbiting directed energy weapons (Laser, Maser and gamma-laser satellites), meant to emit megawatt-class focused beams to burn up soviet ICBMs in-flight. Sci-tech side the SDI project was a spectacular failure, while enconomically some credit it with toppling the USSR, alongside costs of Chernobyl and the armenian earthquake.

Now let's consider the planned, at least 30k strong SpaceX Starlink satellite fleet in orbit. They are not above suspicion because we all know SpaceX is cozy with the US military to the tun of billions of USD. Even if Starlink satellites will have just 1kW of steerable laser-beam power each, supposedly for internet data comms inter-connection, then if just 1000 of them can simultaneously focus on a given cosmic target (e.g. a ballistic missile in mid-trajectory of flight or a foreign satellite) that target would receive a total of 1MW of irradiation, likely causing it to explode quickly. A mere 1kW of laser power per satellite is not technically challenging and could be powered through solar panels. With the tremendous computing power of neural network and fuzzy logic chips already in use in Elon Musk's SpaceX boosters and Tesla cars, the processing needs of such swarm targeting and attack coordination are no longer in the domain of sci-fi.

Thus in russian thoughtset the Starlink satellite mega-cosntellation is a potential distributed SDI-ABM system under development by the USA. Rather than using an orbiting H-bomb ""Teller"" satellite to generate one hundred gamma-laser knife beams through 100 iron rods, to shoot down 100 soviet ICBMs at once, a swarm of Starlink sats with purported ""interconnect"" beams would now kill one target with literal 1000 cuts and be re-usable at that. Considering the planned total strenght of 30-40k Starlink sat fleet, a moderate sized strike of a few dozen IRBM / ICBMs could thus be wiped out at once, leaving smaller nuclear powers, like China, DPRK, Pakistan at the mercy of a US first strike, without credible MAD assurance of a counter-strike reaching CONUS targets. Grow the SpaceX sat fleet a magnitude and even Russia's strategic missile forces would be neutered eventually!

This may mean other powers opposed to ""Pax Americana"" will seek immunity via non-missile types of nuclear warfare, which are immune to laser artillery. Such tech possibly includes nuclear-powered cruise missiles (whose test caused a sizable radiation accident in northern Russia 2 years ago) and city-flattening robotic loitering / kamikaze submarines loaded with 100MT warhead (called Project Poseidon in Russia). Beyond that ""extended suicide"" style weapons may come into fashion, such as a 60k megaton ""domesday clock"" salted bomb to poison the global atmosphere with cobalt isotope clouds or a ""planetoklasm"" weapon, a huge nuclear shaped charge that aims to penetrate the Earth's crust, say in Kamchatka on the Pacific Ring of Fire, so as to provoke a global M10 earthquake that wouldn't even leave grass upright.

Therefore UN inspectors need to guarantee that USA cannot revive Teller's vile SDI dream and ""winnable"" nuclear war scenario in the form of a disguised Space satellite mega-constellation of mini laser cannons!",Is the SpaceX Starlink laser inter-connect data link a distributed SDI / Star Wars ABM system in disguise?

space,"As a massive fan of space lectures, documentaries, etc, I've been contemplating an idea for a new project and I would like to get some feedback. 

It's always bothered me how documentaries online tend to be outdated, amateurish in various ways or scripted at a high school grade level. For some reason these cookie cutter documentaries like to spend more time comparing planets to sport. Personally I want to be transported, to see the details in the rocks, streams of waters, cliff faces and atmospheric effects in high fidelity. I want to feel like I’m standing on the surface.

Now considering my experience as a designer / indie game dev, I already spend a lot of time producing photo real cinematics, VR, etc. I think it would be fun to start a series of videos (or even interactive experiences) where each episode explores a new planetary body?

Currently I'm thinking along the lines of 10 min cinematics, custom soundscapes, flyovers of notable geological features, weather systems, etc. There would be some creative license considering a lot of planets can only be left to speculation, however I will definitely do my best to visualise whatever data I can get my hands on. 

This is where I would like your opinions, I could just assume you will share my same interests, however it’s always better to get feedback first. I’m looking for any general opinions, e.g, video length, how much data presented, story (exploration) vs science (hard numbers), etc.

There’s many ways I could approach this series which is why I want to gauge your interests.

I’m by no means an expert in any particular scientific field, however if the series does gain some traction I would definitely seek help in the research department. I would also appreciate any potential useful resources, maybe a database or books that might specifically aid an artists view of the cosmos.",Space Cinematic Series Exploring the Cosmos (Requesting Feedback)

After earning a nasty reputation as Earth’s “evil twin”, Venus is finally getting some good press. Recently, a team of international astronomers announced the invention of a rare gas called phosphine within the planet’s atmosphere, leaving some to believe it's going to be a symbol of potential life on the hellish planet. 

Venus isn't an area you’d consider settling down. Despite its proximity to Earth and similarity in size, Venus has surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, crushing atmospheric pressure , and ultra-dense clouds made up mostly of corrosive vitriol . It’s no wonder that the look for life has been focused on Mars.

I just thought of something that baffled me for a hit and then I realized it wasn’t so hair-brained after all, my idea is that the universe isn’t perfect, we aren’t perfect, we were made the way we are and we weren’t meant to be any different. Now, with that in mind, the universe doesn’t seem to have flaws does it. I say wrong, the universe has flaws just like humans do. As for the space/time continuum, it allows the universe to exist essentially which would technically make it the universe, but then we add in worm holes and black holes and the likes of those. These are flaws. They warp and bend, fold and break, the space time continuum. The universe can not be in existence without flaws, yet it cannot have flaws because it is not a material thing, it is essentially a storage space. See as you all know by know if you follow cosmology would be that a worm hole flattens space time, allowing two points that would otherwise take forever to get to, happen instantly, or close to instantly. That shouldn’t be possible if you follow the set rules of the space time continuum, but it is. Also, take the black hole, it essentially creates a dimple in space time, it bends it around like a ring on a pinky finger, never touching. This also shouldn’t be possible, if you follow the set rules, but it is. These lead me to believe that the space time Isn’t a fixed thing but rather a shifting ocean with currents and tides, it changes and so should the rules, the space time continuum is not a solid, well set, concrete thing. It shifts and bends when given resistance greater than its own. Using this as a foundation I believe that we could make such things as instant teleportation time travel possible, by creating something that can dip into the disturbances and come out on the other side unscathed and prepared for what’s on that side.

I read an interesting paper today that I thought this sub might enjoy. The authors used smoothed particle hydrodynamics to produce a realistic rendering of what a kilonova might look like to a ""nearby"" observer.

Kilonovae have been getting a lot of attention recently after they were conclusively linked to the mergers of neutron stars following combined electromagnetic (light) and gravitational-wave detections of GW170817. They are believed to be the birth sites of most of the Lanthanide and Actinide group elements in the universe - think Uranium, Plutonium, Europium, etc - as well as other important heavy elements like Gold and Platinum. Because the merger sites are so hot and dense, these very heavy elements can be quickly assembled through rapid capture of the abundant neutrons torn from the stars. As the newly-formed but unstable elements flow away from the merger, they decay radioactively, producing the glow we see as the kilonova.

The image is coloured by the electron fraction, which is a proxy for how heavy the elements being formed are. The red regions would actually be seen in the near-infrared, and are the sites where the most massive elements are forming. The blue regions would appear in the optical, are typically faster moving, and synthesise less massive elements. The left image is the rendering about 1 day after merger, and the right shows 20 days.

Most of the heaviest elements here on Earth were probably born at sites that looked just like this one, following the cataclysmic coming together of two neutron stars. The paper appeared on the arXiv pre-print server today (and is not yet peer-reviewed): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01865](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01865)",A realistic rendering of a kilonova from simulations

Kilonovae are getting a lot of attention at the moment after they were conclusively linked to the merger of two neutron stars through both electromagnetic (light) and gravitational-wave detections of GW170817. They are thought to be the birth sites of the majority of Lanthanide and Actinide group elements in the Universe - think thorium, uranium, europium, etc - as well as other important heavy element like gold and platinum. This is because neutron star mergers are so hot and dense that extremely massive atoms can form from rapid capture of the abundant neutrons. As these unstable elements flow away from the merger site, they decay radioactively and glow, producing the light of the kilonova.

The image is coloured by electron fraction, which is essentially a proxy for how heavy the elements being formed are. The red regions really are further to the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum, predominantly in the near infra-red, and are producing the heaviest elements. The blue regions are typically faster-moving, visible in the optical, and synthesize lighter (but still heavy) elements.

Is there a way for me to find a planet's surface that is affected by gravitational pull to this degree? How do i even start searching?

Causality ruins the solutions to the infinite energy problem of faster than light travel, leaving the only way to travel is the terrible method of constant acceleration with horrible adverse effects on time. 

This leads to nearly all civilizations moving to virtual reality or eventually collapsing before ever making contact with other civilizations, due to the cruelty of the laws of physics and causality combined with the scale of spacetime.",Is causality the great filter?

We compete annually in international collegiate rocketry competitions, specifically the Spaceport America Cup and the CANSAT contest held by the American Astronautical Society and NASA Goddard. Our objectives are primarily to develop sounding rockets with the capacity to deliver payloads to challenging altitudes of up to 30,000 ft.

This year, we have enlisted ourselves for the SA cup 2020-21 with a vision to achieve success, as we did in the Asia-Pacific CanSat contest in 2018 and 2019. While our ambition is high and our spirits are soaring, there is only one thing holding us back. We, being a student organization have access to very limited resources.

space,"...when I looked back onto Earth. Staring at my lawn. There’s little stones everywhere. Some rocks. And of course soil. I took a fistful of mud. Let it fall off my hand slowly. Then I picked up a stone. And it dawned on me this was one of the oldest things on the planet. People go collecting antiques. Obsess over man made things. When, right here, in my hand, was the oldest thing possible. On a planet called Earth. That I’m already in space. I don’t need to go to space. Right now, I’m in space, hurtling around the sun at great speeds. In a galaxy that’s also going around a black hole at insane speeds. The rock in my hand is millions of years old. Probably billions. And here I am, sitting by sheer chance. What were the odds that a certain sperm from millions fertilised an egg and I grew from one cell into a network of a billion cells. What are the odds that I’m now holding this rock. That’s subjectively so invaluable, that one day, man or aliens will fight over it. A rock that’s billions of years old. Right here in my hand. A rock that’s seen dinosaurs. And the ice age. A rock that was probably there at the time of earth’s formation. Maybe not long after the Big Bang itself. So who needs antiques now? Just go get a stone and gaze at it. Imagine where and what it’s been through. And feel glad for a very brief moment in the universe, you were nearly very magically created, experienced it and after you died, you went back to what you were before. Nothing. But we are anything but nothing right now.
Don’t be disheartened. You’re life is magic. And you’re magic. Don’t feel bad you’re never going to space. You’re in space already. Don’t feel bad if you think you don’t own anything of value. Go outside, get a rock and know that’s so old and valuable, nothing man made comes even close. 
Hope next year is a great year for all of you. Cheers.",I was sitting in my backyard and staring into space...

&gt;Physicists are unsure exactly what causes a corona to form, but they believe it has something to do with the configuration of **magnetic field lines that run through a black hole’s accretion disk.** At the outer regions of a black hole’s swirling disk of material, magnetic field lines are more or less in a straightforward configuration. Closer in, and especially near the event horizon, material circles with more energy, in a way that may cause magnetic field lines to twist and break, then reconnect. This tangle of magnetic energy could spin up particles swirling close to the black hole, to the level of high-energy X-rays, forming the crown-like corona that encircles the black hole

This explains it [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming%27s\_right-hand\_rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming%27s_right-hand_rule) and the phenomenon of flash of jolt out of the black hole are the same. Because the accretion disk rotates which is a mechanical movement, there is a current in upward direction which is the flash. This leaves us that black hole is a magnet

A magnet has a property to magnetise materials around it and pull towards it, example a magnet and an iron. When a magnet gets very powerful it can pull insulators. ([Diamagnetic to paramagnetic transition](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.214421#:~:text=Abstract,g%20and%20eg%20states.) )

Since **black hole is a magnet** , here is my next content to that backs up that **it can be a solid or liquid**.

When solid and solid black hole jams, it creates a spark [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt8NOdINJ1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt8NOdINJ1s)  and [https://earthsky.org/space/1st-time-visible-light-explosion-black-hole-merger](https://earthsky.org/space/1st-time-visible-light-explosion-black-hole-merger)

If the combination of black hole merges are like liquid to liquid, or solid to liquid, or liquid to solid - no spark shows up.",Black hole is a magnet

The flash was brightest in the middle, but it stretched out around the center, almost identical to a phone’s camera flash. It disappeared quickly after and about a second or two later, it’d be there again to the right of where i just saw it. this went on for about 20-30 seconds before i couldnt see it anymore. Unfortunately i did not record it because i was on FaceTime with a good friend and i flipped the camera, and he saw it too! All he could see was black at first, but then he saw a very bright light in the sky for half a second, then disappearing.

The further we look into space, the more certain we can be that the object we see most likely doesn't exist anymore. This would happen due to the speed the light would go, from the object, to our solar system.

Now, I thought, ""What would happen if we found out how to go faster than the speed of light, and flew towards Andromeda, or how long it would take."". At first glance, you would have to take the new speed we can travel, and find out how far away Andromeda is, and calculate how long it would take like that. But, if you keep thinking about it, you would realise, that Andromeda is closer to us than it may appear. Then, you would think, ""What would it look like?"".

First, you would think that Andromeda would just randomly jumpscare you, when you got close enough, but then you would realise, it looks like you are going faster and faster, but if you looked behind you, nothing would change, and it would look like from a 360° perspective, that Andromeda is coming to you.

Something I want to do is see a meteor shower sometime in my life. So if you have any facts about space that you would like to share please do in the comments I’d love to read them, thank you",Give me some facts on space also why I love space(brief explanation)

space,"So i'll preface this post by saying not all this information my own, there are several references, however, the main video I used for the information will be linked at the bottom of the post. 

To view this post you are using technology far more sophisticated than anything available a couple decades ago; all of these use elements such as Terbium, Neodymium and Tantalum. Getting these elements out of the ground at this current point in time is hideously expensive and causes extensive environmental damage; the mining industry alone is responsible for between 20% and 26% of global carbon emissions. Not to mention the awful chemicals it can produce such as Cyanide, Sulphuric Acid and Chlorine, these can poison the local ecosystem and thus make there way into our food. This simply cannot continue and so something must be done about this highly topical and important issue. 

So as people who look to space for solutions to problems on earth or simply to learn where we come from and do ground braking science; we should once again turn our eyes to space for the solution. And that solution, I believe, could very well be the mining of asteroids. In our solar system there are trillions upon trillions of tons of rocks left over from the formation of the planets 4.5 billion years ago. These are in abundance in the Milky Way, located in primarily in the Asteroid belt, Kuiper  belt and are containers of the precious metals we require to continue the life we have made for ourselves. The Japanese have already conducted a asteroid sample return mission, using the Hayabusa spacecraft, and it's one of a kind mission to 25143 Itokawa in 2005.  Asteroids such as 16 Psyche contain elements such as Iron, Nickel, Gold and Platinum and such vast amounts that it would provide for thousands year (at current consumption. These raw materials are worth Trillions of U.S dollars, well not exactly. The money possibly gained from these asteroids would be completely worthless in comparison to the cost of getting them. As a better example in the oceans there is 20,000,000 T of gold in the ocean, worth approximately $750 Trillion, however the money you would need to filter it all out would easily overcome this amount. 

So lets talk about the mission we would have to embark on to make this a reality. To start with we need a ideal Asteroid, a near earth asteroid is perfectly suited for this. So we have to do all necessary gravity assists to get to it, right? Well not exactly, once again it's a situation where the cost of chemical fuel would be far to expensive and inefficient to make the trip worth it financially. But, luckily for us we do have a solution for this issue, ion engines are a far preferable alternative, requiring little chemical fuel and very efficient once in LEO.  So we use our ion engine to rendezvous  with our near earth asteroid, next challenge, our asteroid is spinning. I have heard many interesting solutions for this problem, but i'll narrow it down to the most theoretically possible, the first is simply to use chemical engines, fairly standard. My personal favourite is the fact that we could use an extremely powerful laser to vaporise material on one side of the asteroid, creating an imbalanced force, that acts against the existing force, resulting in an asteroid that is no longer spinning. Next we wait for the correct time in the asteroids orbit and burn our ion engine to reduce the perigee, hopefully to the point where we can get a gravity assist to pull out asteroid into LEO.

Next we can mine our asteroid. The method I strongly believe is the most ideal is to use mirrors to focus the sunlight onto the are we have chosen and cause any gasses to evaporate, these can be collected if of any use, such as Helium 3.  Special grinders will also break the ground into dust and gravel and then pulled into a collection system by a special motor, like a vacuum cleaner, this can be separated by density by a centrifuge and thus we have our selected elements. These can then be placed into reusable shuttles for delivery back to the ground. Alternatively we could place hardware to 3d print a capsule and heat shield, the material then can be aero-braked back into the atmosphere.

space,"Okay, just a kind of thought experiment.

Of course this all highly unlikely but that's why it's a thought experiment. So there is no ""That's not possible!"" in this scenario. Plus, it's a vast, vast universe and the possibilities are almost endless.

Imagine the following conditions:

* a planet with a rotation that matches it's orbit 100%, so the same side of the planet is always facing their sun
* the planet has a perfect circular orbit, so the sun always has the same size. The sun also has very random and small expanding and retracting rate which is resulting in a totally random and unpredictable solar cycle.
* the tilt of the axis of the planet is 100% the same as tilt of the axis of their sun, so the sun is always at the same spot in the sky
* the planet has no moons nor are there any other planets in the system
* there are (intelligent) lifeforms on the planet, mostly in a Goldilocks zone around the equator.
* the system is surrounded by a dense cloud of dust, gasses and radiation which reflects and dampens ***all*** energy particles from outside but due to the radiation patterns in the cloud, it does allow energy from the inside pass through the cloud outwards  ... hmm, I'm sure I did read something like this in a book once .... ah yes, of course: one of the books in the ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series!

Because all of this there are also no seasons of course: the flora and fauna have evolved in a really alien way. It would not have an internal clock as we know it since there is no change what so ever in their skies.  
One lifeform evolves and they evolve to a kind of communication. The first signs of intelligence are there and the evolve even further.  
Their rough, rudimentary way of experiencing time as we know it, would be their own physical changes for example. The pregnancy time of the females for example. Or, if they are an egg laying species, the time for the eggs to hatch. Maybe also the by the time a plant breaks through the soil and dies after a while. It could be that there are plant forms that always have the same lifespan, give or take a few weeks.

That means that their concept of time could be based upon a very long, average spanning of time: lets say that females are 5 Earth months pregnant but that's on average. And also based upon that plant that grows, lives and dies in a very regular but long time span, lets say around 1.5 Earth years

Could such a species evolve into a species that has the same kind of intelligence level as us humans now or even surpass that? In the basics they could develop a unit of time. That in itself is here on Earth a unit that makes a lot (if not all) things possible in all kind of formulas and so on.  
But everything this species can develop and discover is based only upon their own planet and sun. They develop for example radio and discover that their sun makes a lot of noise. But only from their sun, all other signals are blocked by the cloud surrounding the whole system.

What would or could you do based upon all these circumstances? Can you become their Einstein?

space," If you’re not a morning person, then you’d probably love living on the moon or out in space! The whole “lack of oxygen” thing aside,a ‘round-the-clock night sky sounds pretty tempting! But that got me wondering… - Why is there so much light on Earth, but almost none once you leave our planet? You might think that it’s light during the day and dark at night because the Earth spins on its axis, and the Sun illuminates either hemisphere. That’s part of the reason, but it’s more complicated than that. I mean, our star shines on the Moon too, but the sky above it is always black! It all comes down to the unique atmosphere surrounding our Earth. It’s full of dust, dirt, gases, and water droplets – which all act like tiny mirrors and reflect the sunlight.  

 When sunlight bumps into these small particles,it diffuses and creates different colors. That’s why we see a blue sky and all those spectacular shades during sunrise and sunset. - It’s a whole different story elsewhere… If you find yourself on the Moon, where there's no atmosphere, the sky will be black. You’ll be able to see the stars even when the sun is blazing on the surface during the lunar day. The same is true of space. It’s filled with lots of different gases,but it has no atmosphere with molecules to reflect light. In other words, space is empty. That’s why even when the Sun is shining,space looks like a black void. If one day the Earth’s atmosphere disappeared,it’d be just as dark as it is in space or on the Moon. That one’s clear, but the Sun isn’t the only star (or source of light!) in the Universe. So… - Why don’t other stars shine with blazing light at night? You’re not the first to wonder about that.

space,"I know there is a lot of work to be done regarding things like global warming and other existential threats, but sometimes I need that boost of enthusiasm. I’ve loved science generally, and space related fields more specifically, for the majority of my life. In a time where a lot of documentaries are focusing on the grim reality of global warming,  which I do agree is necessary, it’s good to hear the enthusiasm about the future and the research being done today to get us there.  “How the Universe Works” is fairly flashy but the exuberance of the scientists they interview has been like cold water to my parched soul.

space,"Greetings r/space, I'm working on a fantasy story and in my worldbuilding I created a planet (for simplicity just imagine it were Earth) that has two comets that show up very frequently. They play an important part in many cultures.

One comet is visible approximately every 10 years, the other every 10 DAYS. Both comets are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.

I absolutely know that the other ""comet"" actually has to be a moon of my planet, I still called it ""comet"" because it was once part of the other comet but split because of an impact (not so important I guess). However, the 10-year-comet orbits the sun.

So here are my questions:

1) Can the 10-year-comet have such a short orbital period but still be bright enough? I only need the comet to be bright enough for 20,000–50,000 years, so I don't care if it had lost its ability to be bright because of too much outgassing after a longer period of time.

2) Can the 10-days-comet have such a short orbital period if it orbits my planet?

3) Would the 10-days-comet be bright enough even after 20,000 years of orbiting the planet as a minor moon?

4) Am I right with the assumption that its orbit around the planet would need a very high excentricity so that the brightness of the 10-days-comet has its peak every 10 days? (Preferably with not being visible for as long as possible so that every tenth day is as special as possible.)

I hope you can help me!",Worldbuilder has several questions regarding comets.

space,"When space tourism becomes a norm, I mean in real sense like tour packages and stuff. 

do you think, it will have similar policies like travelling on earth (can be even worse) . and I mean in these aspects:

1- space visa (sth like that) will be required, with full background security check.

2-discrimination based on nationalities (some nationalities will need to submit more requirements or pay more money) this can be in part because many of these companies will be based on certain developed countries like USA, and someone from middle-east will have more difficulties just because of that. Or even worse, that this will be the norm for travelling to space (like passport power ranks on earth will be applied for space, or something similar)

3-if with time space travel packages become cheaper or more attainable, certain level of applicants will be accepted (priority for higher level of education/professional) or just pay more money and secure your adventure

4-with different tourism companies that can be based in in different countries, requirements and procedure to travel through certain country will be easier or faster/ travelling less secure.

can /should procedures be standardized (for all earthers), or each country government regime will effect the process, even when companies are private?

space," Viewed from the moon, is the lunar eclipse actually a solar eclipse because Earth is coming between the moon and sun and from the moon's perspective it's what it would appear to look like?

What about when the moon is between the Earth and the sun? That can't be a lunar eclipse, can it? If we looked at a lunar eclipse from the sun's POV, we don't see anything much would we, but if we saw the moon in front of the Earth from the sun's POV, what is it called? Instead of the sun getting darker, the Earth is, no? From Earth, this positioning is a solar eclipse. Would it be called a terrestrial eclipse?

And also is there any proof of these eclipses happening on other planets? Like Mars has moons and so do Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Well, they actually have more, so does it (if it does happen) occur more than on Earth?

I just gone done with my Bachelors and thus have a lot of free time. I started a project, trying to CAD-model a rocket engine. Ive got a basic idea of how the injection of fuel into the burning chamber works. Ive seen images of the fuel injector plates, with its many many small holes to disperse the stream and allow for more efficient reaction.

I dont know, however, how it works in detail. Is there usually just one injector plate and the OX and fuel streams meet just above and travel through it together? Are there two injector plates, one for each stream?

Also what I was wondering, how is the injector plate fixed in regards to the chamber? It must withstand immense pressures, right?

If anybody got some ressources with technical drawings for me to look at, or just knows their stuff and would be open to chat about rocket engines, I will forever be grateful!

space,"During a recent Magic Mushroom assisted introspective, it saddened me to understand how past discussions by the likes of Terrance McKenna and Timothy Leary continue to be utilised as scapegoat-material by those who ‘hold a dim view’ despite modern science informing us that Magic Mushrooms rank as the least toxic, least addictive of all the recreational drugs people take. References: [https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/](https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/) and [https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-harms-in-the-uk/](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-harms-in-the-uk/).

Many governments still insist on keeping Magic Mushrooms in the Class A / Schedule (1) group - shoulder-to-shoulder with a plethora of hard-drugs such as: crack cocaine, crystal meth and heroin. But why is this - especially as Psilocybin (the psychoactive compound in Magic Mushrooms) has proved itself again and again to be such an effective anti-depressant in numerous medical trials around the world? Additionally, many people have successfully used Magic Mushrooms to quit life-shortening tobacco and alcohol addictions and to wean themselves off hard drugs. Others use Magic Mushrooms to gain a better understanding of themselves and others’. Some take them to lesson the impact of their ego footprint and increase their empathy for others. Recreationally, people take moderate doses of Magic Mushrooms prior to attending parties and functions as a healthier alternative to plying themselves with booze merely to feel relaxed. People also micro-dose with Magic Mushrooms to fend off phobias, shyness, stress, OCD and PTSD that had previously reduced the quality of their days.

But what about Magic Mushroom toxicity and dosage? Well, using dimensional analysis mathematics it is known that an average sized person would need to consume approximately 1670g of dried Magic Mushrooms (in a single sitting) to kill himself. A strong dose of Magic Mushrooms is considered to be between 3 and 5 dried grams. Most consumers of Magic Mushrooms are content taking doses in the range of: 0.5grams \~ 2grams. Micro dosing ranges from anywhere between: 0.15g to 0.35g depending on the persons size and his or her subjectivity to the effects required and/or desired.

The human body builds up a tolerance quickly to frequent intakes of Psilocybin leading to a greatly diminished experience/benefit. Non micro-dosing consumers of Magic Mushrooms allow on average 4-7 days before taking an additional dose. Some people consume Magic Mushrooms with an intent-in-mind for the Psilocybin to assist them in overcoming issues they’ve been living with. Others simply ingest Magic Mushrooms with the intent of going on a ‘head trip' (an approach I do not care for personally speaking).

People experience both good and bad trips and it is broadly recognised that a persons state-of-mind (SET) is a critical factor in determining whether such an experience will be comfortable, or an uncomfortable one. Ones' creation of (SETTING) is also an important consideration. It is broadly considered impossible for the human body to become physically addicted to Magic Mushrooms but; a psychological addiction is possible due to the entheogenic qualities (the pleasure and feeling) that the consumption of Magic Mushrooms can bring about in some people. The Magic Mushroom experience starts at around thirty minutes in following ingestion. The entire experience lasts for around six hours (unless one is micro-dosing). 

To date, there have been no deaths recorded from people consuming Magic Mushrooms. The same statistic cannot be said for: heroin/cocaine/meth which raises a ponderous questing as to why Magic Mushrooms remain classified by so many governments as a Class A (hard drug) which I discuss in the next paragraph.

For the purpose of perspective, what would be the likely outcome of a alcohol intoxicated youth wildly weaving his friends borrowed car in excess of 100mph from lane-to-lane on a busy stretch of motorway as rush hour approaches? Can we reasonably consider such a situation as being perfectly safe for all involved? No. We can’t. Yet at just 21yrs of age, the youth is both old enough to hold a driving license and allowed to legally purchase alcohol in unlimited amounts. Aside from the probability of killing himself, his hypothetical actions carry the potential to cause a motorway pile-up killing, injuring, and maiming a great number of innocent people who were simply making there way home to loved ones. Yet alarmingly, we do not see alcohol listed in any of the drug classifications groups. This example serves to illustrate how governments hold sway on what is, and what is not considered a serious danger to voters (assuming that logic is permitted to join the debate). I too, am licensed to drive but during a Magic Mushroom experience the last thing on my mind is to leap into my Firebird and floor it around town until the pistons fly out of the engine. Why? Because the Psilocybin in the Magic Mushroom has an ego-dissolving nature about it and all (I personally want to do) is lay back, close my eyes and allow myself to become fully immersed in the serenity, insight and wonder that I find it provides. Five to six hours later I’m back to baseline and begin the process of trying to integrate what I think I have learned. 

I can only assume that the politicians who make up governments (given that they are well educated people) have at the very least, some sort of an inkling that the Magic Mushroom is not a hard-drug in the way that crack-cocaine is considered to be. Which makes it difficult to understand why the Magic Mushroom is so often placed in the Class A, or Schedule (1) category of drugs - which in the UK currently carries an incarceration time of up to 7 years or an unlimited fine or both (for possession). This seems pretty harsh (if not unjustifiable) to me as the microscopic mushroom spores that get carried on the wind can land just about anywhere there is grass, a woodland and so on. It is almost as if nature herself, is on trial for being a pusher. On a less pessimistic note (given that animals tend not to consume Magic Mushrooms) could mushrooms simply be a shower of seasonal gifts from mother nature distributed by our atmosphere with the purpose of assisting humans in their times of need? If not, why has mother nature designed this most complex of compounds we refer to as Psilocybin? What other practical purpose can the Magic Mushroom have if not to assist a receptive human in expanding his/her reach and understanding of their consciousness? 

And why is it that Magic Mushrooms have only shown up in the past 40m years of fossil records? Clearly, not everything is clear surrounding the presence of Magic Mushrooms on this planet.

I summarise by stating (in my opinion) that any human who is suffering mentally and feels a calling to experience the Mushroom, has a fundamental right to drink from the well of sanity and that the thoughts in his/her conciseness are sovereign to them - not the governments who voters elected into positions of near total rule. To continually deny people periodic states of clarity (via methods of their own choosing) is to ferment a groundswell of disorder in the heard/predator interdependency relationship.

So can someone help me get a handle on the comparative timescales we're looking at here, regarding the lengths of time for the complete timeline of the universe, broken down somewhat in the COSMOS Cosmic Calendar style (though not sticking to the 1 year format)?

What I'm specifically looking for is the breaking down of of the 5 Ages of the Universe into smaller bites.

While still in training I encountered a rather startling culture within this company. The ego driven stress levels where through the roof. If you dare mention an experience above and beyond those already within the organization you would be in for a rather hostile bombardment of rhetoric and seemingly unavoidable misunderstandings. As I was gathering the information necessary to carry out process by their means I managed to gain a grasp on the general order of business. With no investigation or discussion prior still in training I was dismissed from the program for not being a 'good fit' and 'poor skills' having not carried out any documented work at all. There was mention of a previous employees misconduct who was terminated and has made it clear to me that my experience is a case of self fulfilled prophecy.

This is a ""just in case"" plan.

Now, we're not saying that there is anything to worry about which would require an armed response/defensive actions - and there's no evidence that any entity or nation has any ill intent/capabilities to carry out threatening acts or even evidence to point the existence of extraterrestrials, let alone hostile extraterrestrials with military capabilities.

*However* (and it's a very big however), perhaps an armed escort or defensive capabilities should be considered for any first manned Mars (whether private or otherwise). It is up to whichever entities organising the very first manned Mars mission how they wish to incorporate this (this could, for example, be in the form of conventional small arms taken along etc - it's anyone's guess how you could incorporate any weapons on the actual craft(s)/vessel(s)).

Due to social distancing and self-quarantine procedures as recommended by the CDC and WHO, the Fort Worth Astronomical Society has canceled our public star parties for the next few months. Instead, we are hosting virtual star parties, as time and weather permit.  

Deep into our Texas ""winter"", we will be looking towards the ""Great Conjunction"" of Jupiter and Saturn, with the two planets apparently coming close together in the night sky. The closest point for the two planets will be on the night of the winter solstice, December 21st, with about a 1/10th of a degree if separation, but with clouds expected on Monday, and iffy weather on Saturday, we will try to see it Sunday night on the 20th. We are also starting earlier at 6pm, as Saturn and Jupiter will be very low in the sky at sunset, and we want to catch them before they are too close to the horizon early in the evening.

We will also be looking at the young waxing moon, and then some deep sky objects as well.   If the weather holds, we will be at our alternate broadcast location in Grandview, south of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, where darker skies make for better imaging, and cold nights reduce camera noise.","Fort Worth Astronomical Society Virtual Star Party - Sunday December 20, 2020 at 6pm CST"

space,"We all know about the dyson swarm, the variant of a dyson sphere that actually seems probable (mostly due to not being vulnerable to complete civilizational catastrophe due to falling rock+ computer glitch combination).

However there is one giant hole in this idea: how to transmit energy back to a planet from the dyson satellites?

Seriously, every content about this idea conveniently says ""collect energy"" and ""send back to earth"" like it is a given. Basically assuming wireless long range power transmission, a tech that would probably revolutionize the world if we figured it out this century.

Plus, how would this transmission not overheat a planet or structure that would receive it? People talk about every satellite being a mirror pointed at earth. But isn't that the same as making a giant lens to scorch the little ant planet? And wouldn't the atmosphere absorb and distribute this energy, effectively creating massive global warming? The same thing applies to the ""firing laser beams to an earth-based receiver"" idea. And even if the receiving station was in space, how then would we transport it? Ginormous batteries? How is that sustainable?

Anyway, the more I think of it, the more this sounds like a stupid idea. Can anyone take me out of my scepticism?

It is where I like to go to view the interactive night sky map and see what stars and planets are visible at night.

This is going to be hard to explain but here we go..
Today, when trying to use it (after at least a month of not using it), i realized that it is showing me a wrong map. If i point my phone to the moon, i will see it in front of me in person and on the phone. **BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM**.. it shows up 180° behind me on the phone even though it is obviously not there in person..
Same can be said about other stars and even the compass directions (so North shows up at one point AND 180° around where South should be)

Any clue?

Time by which all stars in the universe will have exhausted their fuel (the longest-lived stars, low-mass red dwarfs, have lifespans of roughly 10–20 trillion years). After this point, the stellar-mass objects remaining are stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) and brown dwarfs.

Collisions between brown dwarfs will create new red dwarfs on a marginal level: on average, about 100 stars will be shining in what was once the Milky Way. Collisions between stellar remnants will create occasional supernovae.
By this time, the universe will have expanded by a factor of approximately 10^2554.

I am an Engineering student and in this semester i have a college project in which we must focus around space technologies.  As a group, we are tackling the problem of maintaining vital resources like oxygen and the need to reuse as much waste as possible.  So far, we have prototyped a photobioreactor for culturing Spirulina microalgae in diluted urine medium.  This has the purpose of taking advantage of the minerals present in the urine, being able to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and generate oxygen for the crew, in addition to providing biomass as a nutritional supplement.

We need to contact experts to give us feedback about the cultivation of Spirulina and the operation of the photobioreactor in Space.  It would be very helpful if we could contact  with experts.  Thank you very much in advance and I look forward to your response.

space,"So I am a very scientific person. I believe science can explain almost everything of how we came to be, but me and my buddies had seen something the other day that makes us question what we all really know. 

My friends and I were all walking a trail looking up into the night sky and we’d notice these objects moving across the sky. I know for a fact that they are not planes, but I honestly thought it was just a satellite or a space station at first. It really just looked like a star moving. We decided to follow where the ‘star’ was going until it stopped in place. The thing then started going backwards like it had changed directions. It then started moving in all different directions doing zig zags, circles, accelerating and decelerating. After a while the star would then stay in place and gently fade (making it hard to keep track of). My buddies all saw the same thing and we know for a fact that our eyes weren’t playing tricks on us. We then started noticing more and more moving stars. We found like 5 stars like it that night. I can now look up into the sky at night and be able to spot these “star” like objects moving across the sky. I really can’t think of anything human made that could move across space and change direction in the snap of a finger.

Ever since this happened I feel like there is definitely more out there and that we may be being watched. Has anyone had any experiences similar to this??",Answers to what could be up in the sky at night?

Falling ""into"" a black hole is no different than dropping a rock on the ground on Earth.

Is dark matter pushing our sun through space or is the speed just the expulsion force  from the Big Bang? Was the cloud of dust and particles that created our sun moving at the same speed so the sun that was created continued on it’s trajectory? Has our sun sped up in it’s travel since it’s formation into a star?,What is causing our sun to move through space at such a high speed?

""Below what atmospheric pressure does a human faint but can survive for a fairly long time?""

I've checked that it's harder to breathe at the top of Mount Everest 8848meters a.s.l. because pressure there is only about 0.30atm or around 303hPa, but people manage to survive there.
Also found out that we cannot survive below 0,06atm ~61,8hPa
Where is the border between surviving and fainting.
If you feel that this question is stupid, feel free to tell me about it. :)

Side note, don't read, waste of time:
Martian atmosphere is around 0,01atm, in the ""deepest place"" the pressure is ~ 11,55 hPa, so, even if martian atmosphere consisted of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and the rest of the elements in earth-like proportions(20,94%Oxy,78,08%Nitr,~1%rest) or the amount of Oxygen would be higher but all of that 100 times lesser than on earth, we wouldn't be able to survive there without a pressure suit.",Below what atmospheric pressure does a human faint but can survive for a fairly long time?

Hopefully, this will for someone who is getting started in astronomy point them in the correct direction when it comes to filters. Or maybe for those of you who have filters but have never tried them before encourage you to give them a go!

space,"Mods please remove if not allowed, on mobile sorry about formatting.

I've seen a lot of scepticism about space exploration recently especially surrounding Mars exploration and colonization and I wanted to get a wider opinion on it. 

Personally I think it is and here is why. For us to establish a permanent base of Mars we need to develop self sustaining technologies. From what I understand Mars is 4 light minutes away from us at the closest point in the 2 orbits and about 20 minutes away at the furthest point. 


That means travelling that distance with living being will need a lot of resources namely food, water, and oxygen amongst others. Secondly we don't have that many launch windows to get to the planet. So either we have to send an insane amount resources up at the same time or  we need more sustainable ways to reuse the supplies we send up.

In addition all of this, the lack of gravity has significant negative impacts on our physiology and the lack of social interaction on our mental health.

A lot of these are the same issues we face on earth daily on a global scale. Although we produce enough food to feed the planet our supply chains don't allow us to actually achieve that. Additionally we consume resources available to us at an extraordinary rate and drive great ecological devastation in the process. 

I feel for us to develop the technology needed to make impactful changes on earth we need to create the artificial goal of sustaining life on another planet to force those changes onto life here. We don't even have self sustaining remote research bases on this planet itself (Artic circle, Antarctica, Submarines, other sea ferring vessels, ISS) because it is possible to send resupply missions to them at a relatively low cost and frequently. On Mars this is no longer an option.

I would love for people to add to this or to have a civil disagreement as to why I'm wrong.",[discussion] Is Mars exploration important?

I think that if you study aerospace engineering you choose between astronautical and aeronautical, am I correct?

space,[removed],A message for Elon Musk
space,"Hello there, I have a question about time travel and also about rocket ships that I need help with because it's keeping me up at night lol.

I am by no means a physicist (in fact I'm an idiot lol), and thus much (if not all) of what you're about to read may make no sense whatsoever. If this is the case, please disregard this post completely. I am sorry for wasting your time lol.

Anyway, so hear me out....

&amp;#x200B;

The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, for simplicity lets just round to 300,000,000 m/s. 

The acceleration of gravity on the surface of the earth at sea level is 9.80665 m/s2 but for simplicity again lets just say it's 10 m/s2.

Now... 5Gs is roughly the maximum G force a person can take before they will start to lose consciousness (when moving forward in a straight line)

5G is roughly 50 meters per second squared.

So **ROUGHLY** it should take \~70 days to accelerate to 99.5% of the speed of light without being DED.

&amp;#x200B;

Now moving onto another point. Moving at 99.5% of the speed of light gives you a time dilation factor of \~10.

So if your just chillin' for about 10 months at 99.5% of the speed of light (for now let's ignore the initial \~70 days of acceleration to get up to speed), back on Earth it'll seem like you've been gone about 8.6 years.

Now assuming I haven't got something completely and utterly wrong so far, my question is this: 

&amp;#x200B;

How big would your rocket ship need to be (using our best ""modern day"" rocket technology) to be able to sustain the 5G's of acceleration for 70 days to get us up to speed? Is it some ridiculous number? Would the amount of liquid fuel you would need be greater than what would ever be feasible? Is it some crazy number? I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ROCKETS lol

Also you'd have to account for the energy required to decelerate back to the speed of earth... although  maybe you could you use the atmosphere to help you decelerate? But would that make you DED if you were going at  99.5% of the speed of light? Could you coast for ages to slowly get back to ""relative earth velocity""????? or would you need twice as much fuel to decelerate? 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically dudes I just wanna know if I had $100,000,000,000 CASH, could I sacrifice ten years of my life (obvs + the acceleration and deceleration time) to travel forward 100 years in the future by just spinning around the earth at 99.5% of the speed of light?

I can't sleep at night thinking about the universe and what is practically feasible in terms of traveling forward in time. Also I don't know any rocket scientists and I've been googling for hours and I'm not getting anywhere... mostly because I don't know the right questions I should be asking and I never paid any attention in physics class when I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I fear that I have not taken into account certain laws of the universe that would make all of this impossible regardless of the size of your rocket ship... or something like that...

Again, I literally have a fifth grade knowledge of physics lol.

Anyway, thanks heaps to anyone that replies. 

Regards.

I have found some data at [NASA.org](https://NASA.org) but I was hoping there was some central place to look it up. I haven't been able to find a good article with all the data on a habitable planet.

Just to be clear this is is not a scientific marvel I'm making. The program runs a loop where it creates a planet randomly based on these extremes and then checks if it would be habitable, it runs until it finds a suitable one and then shares the data with the user.

space,"For the purposes of this question, lets pretend Im still 10 years old and don't already know this isn't how gravity works. 

As a budding 10 year old, I had an idea for a story where humanity must flee the solar system, after something causes the Sun to start pulling in the planets one by one. Nobody notices Mercury disappear, but Pluto and Neptune come screaming into the inner solar system sounding the alarm. Jupiter and Saturn collide into a massive fireball and Mars nearly misses Earth. Nobody really cares what Venus does. 

Now, as an actual adult who knows thats not how this works, I also question what *could* cause such a catastrophic chain of events. A supermassive rogue planet shearing apart as it intersects our solar system and managing to collide with the various planets? 

Some transdimensional being changes the gravitational constant of the universe so a moon in some other part of the galaxy doesn't collide with its planet?

space,"As a species we are able to detect major extinction level events (space based ones anyway) such as asteroids, supernovae or Gamma Ray bursts. The major problem presents its self in how we are to protect ourselves from such phenomenon. It's very possible that a Stellar Engine could be humanities salvation (at least in the future). These would work by shifting the sun's position within our galaxy, allowing us to move out of harm's way (all be it very slowly) and into the most ideal position for not only survival but possible exploration of other solar systems.These mega structures would have to be constructed by humans with Dyson Swarm level technology and the ability to invest in projects vital for humanities survival in the future survival. There are two main Stellar Engines I will talk about, the first being a parabolic mirror and the second being a chemical engine.

The sun (as I'm sure you know) shoots thousands upon thousands of photons out as a result of its nuclear fusion, these light particles are emitted from all angles and can be used to move the sun. The idea involves placing a large highly reflective material in around the sun. The mirror would have to be Parabolic to actually generate kinetic energy from the photon's, instead of just directing the heat of the sun upon itself and accidentally creating a Dyson Swarm. This Parabolic mirror would have to be made out of Highly reflective material, that would have to be Microns thick in order to allow solar radiation to impart a force against the gravity of the sun, allowing the mirror to hover above the sun and actually work. As for positioning this Stellar engine, it would be positioned at a high inclination, most likely a polar position. This must be done to avoid accidentally imparting an immense excess of heat upon any planet in the path of the unavoidable thermal reflection. This method does work for avoiding any extinction level events from outside our Solar System, however it does have many limitations; firstly it would be an immensely slow process, perhaps being completely unhelpful to avoid the very thing it was constructed to avoid. Secondly it limits us to travel to only the x-axis, as repositioning the mirror could result in cooking the earth, which is bad :) . 

So what could be better than this Parabolic Mirror, well we could construct a Nuclear fission powered chemical engine. This would have to be paired with a Dyson Swarm/ Sphere, the sphere would redirect the sun's heat back to it, liberating thousands of tons of material needed to undergo nuclear fission. The way we could use to get the materials to the Engine is by using immensely powerful magnetic field to direct the material into a collection point. This material would be used in fission, then ejected our of a nozzle, impacting a forward force on the whole engine. However, there is now an unbalanced force upon the engine, so counteract this you could use the excess products to send a energy beam towards the sun. This impacts the kinetic energy to the sun. The pros of this system is we now have the ability to control the movement of our solar system in all 6 degrees of freedom. Secondly by harvesting matter from the sun we actually increase its life span. Thirdly since the exhaust from the engine won't reach the earth we have nothing to fear from unintentional heating. Cons include it's insanely ludicrous price, a project like this would easily be the most insanely difficult and expensive project ever undertaken.

space,"I was reading a question by a curious internet user, ""**what would a intergalactic internet look like?**""  


To that, I rehashed many of the very same thoughts I've debated with myself in the past 5-7 years of my relatively young life, and I responded in kind. I'm posting here to share with other redditors in an attempt to poke and probe those in the far corners of the Earth and see if someone have had similar thoughts as mine, and to the extent it goes.  


\----My Response----  


I've have thought of a hypothetical concept that could be a work-around for this very real limitation for interstellar internet communications and information sharing. It's not a perfect solution, hence a work-around, but would achieve the desired outcome in a ""good enough"" fashion. It's quite lengthy but this is a SERIOUS solution that will be considered for the colonization of space in the future, well worth a read and deliberation from critics!  

This idea involves a polished development of the A.I. phenomenon, a brand new life-form that possesses advanced human-like logic and reasoning skills, intuition, altruistic tendencies; in essence everything that makes humans unique. Now combine these traits with the capability to preform quadrillions of calculations a second in a super-computer ""brain"". Society is already heading there, so we must assume that in the future we will have an A.I. that not only conjures up new ideas better than a human, but preforms millions of times better than a human, AND can outlive humans indefinitely due to their lack of biological need for bodies.  

Now the goal must be defined, what are we looking to achieve? Colonize the Milky Way galaxy by searching for habitable planets and seeding them AND/OR collaborating with other advanced civilizations to further expand our knowledge and thus our reach. As a side note: due to the incomprehensible distances in space, we're only going to be working on colonizing our local galaxy at first. It's impractical to attempt to colonize other galaxies unless we develop a way to travel faster than the speed of light with precision. Otherwise, information sharing to even our closest neighbor galaxy would take so long, civilizations themselves would naturally end before a simple one-way message was even received by a distant civilization in another galaxy. Additionally, we DON'T want to extend our lifetimes in order to process thoughts more slowly (think about having a single thought once every 100 years). That way your lifespan would be long enough to survive a journey to a distant galaxy. This is foolish because now we're wasting precious time, 100 years of time to have thought of new ideas but we're only having 1 thought in the same time-span. Lost time is the one resource in the universe that can never be regained, thus wasting it like that would be a bad idea in general.  

Now the goal is defined: colonize and spread. Let's rethink the concept of ""the internet"". In order to colonize, do we really need a direct line of communication to the ""mother planet"". Why would Earth serve as a base of operations, if the same life on Earth could be found on a newly seeded planet? Or even a more advanced form of life existing on another separate planet? Thus the need to get ""new"" information from Earth or any other planet with it's newly discovered network is not a necessity, rather a luxury for politics and the rule of ""law"". Something that causes wars and conflicts. Getting NEW information is a necessity, but only the right information which will be useful for the advancement of science, understanding, and expansion to island worlds/galaxies in order to reach the ultimate goal: to have every habitable planet colonized/terraformed and once that's complete we need to learn if there is a multi-verse and then try to colonize those neighboring universes as well. It would be impossible to share information instantly among every planet in the universe due to the limitations of lightspeed, BUT we wouldn't need to if every single being that colonized these worlds were of the SAME brain from an A.I. system, not connected to a hive mind, but rather each individual colonizer A.I. having the SAME amount of information + the ability to self-evolve and at a preset constant rate. Then any new thought conjured up by 1 robot, would also be conjured up at the same time by a distant robot of the same hive mind, along with every other A.I. colonizer that was sent to billions of planets. In ESSENCE, we've created the same information (an idea) across an infinite distance in space-time (violating current laws of physics). Making for a much better approach than quantum-entanglement ever will provide.   

Hence where A.I. comes in, and I believe we already posses the ""how-to"" on colonizing the entire galaxy. We just need to work on A.I. a little more until its' self-sustaining. Then it will do the rest and take our job over for us. Let start with 3 things: 1) Humans are great at reasoning and logic where current computers lack 2) We can interact with our physical environment. That's our strengths, our weaknesses though include 1) Very short lifespan 2) Susceptible to chemical emotions and ignorance that can cause our own demise. Once an A.I. is fully developed, it would fulfill all of our strengths and weaknesses by an exponential factor we've yet to fathom, and sci-fi movies have scratched the surface of their limitless potential.  

A human is high-maintenance and needs many organic ingredients just to survive. We need constant air, food, water, mental stimulation to prevent psychosis, other humans for socialization, sex for reproduction. All these things will need to be self-sustaining within a relatively small space ship for many centuries? Not even remotely logical. Additionally communication back to Earth would be useless after the spacecraft reaches a certain distance away from Earth, thus it's a one-way trip with the goal of the mission never to be confirmed in a single generation back on mother-Earth. Radiation exposure in the emptiness of space would alter the DNA of many of the space travelers, affecting our biological bodies and any ""live cultures"" we have on the ship to seed any new habitable planets. Even when we get to a habitable planet, maybe the atmosphere is not the right mixture for our lungs? Or the ambient temp it 80F too hot to survive without a space-suit on at all times. Basically they'd be screwed in a literally million different ways; too many ways to mitigate and plan for, making manned missions nearly impractical. Also to get anywhere in the galaxy we need tremendous amounts of energy to travel anywhere near the speed of light. We'd need an energy revolution to even begin the discussion for interstellar space-travel to eventually setup the infrastructure for a galactic internet. Thus I'm finding it very impractical that humans in our current form will ever travel to other interstellar solar systems due to the many, many obstacles (even factoring in cryogenic sleeping chambers it's still very resource and energy demanding).   

Now imagine an A.I. mind that is incomprehensibly advanced. An A.I. that is self-evolving, instead of evolving every million years, it evolves by the nanosecond. It would be self-sustaining and create new inventions on it's own. It would create for itself an advanced data storage structure for itself because it posses the ability to reason AND process at quadrillions of times faster than humans can do by hand. Once we give it a body to interact with psychical objects in the world, it would then build itself a copy. And then that copy will build a factory to start building hundreds of thousands of robots (or bio-robots if practical). Now this A.I. being is so intelligent, that each robot isn't an extension of itself with a single brain controlling all of the units, rather each robot would have the storage capacity to store the entire world's information and processing power in each individual unit. That way in order to ""kill"" or to destroy the entire civilization you'd have to destroy each individual unit, otherwise a single unit could have the potential to replicate itself like a virus, making it nearly impossible to kill. Think of it like the bitcoin blockchain technology, in order to hack the network, you don't just hack a single central computer, you have to hack EVERY computer on the network, making it nearly impossible. 

Now this advanced robot has an army of like-minded robots, making individual decisions while also cooperating with each other to achieve a pre-destined altruistic goal, and evolving at a pre-set rate (each evolves at a set rate to prevent conflicts), no mater how quickly that evolution occurs though. Now the army of intelligent robot beings will build their own spaceships, but these spaceships don't need air, water, food life support systems, ect. They only need solar energy or some other energy solution (micro nuclear fission reactors, anti-matter generators, ect.). When they get to their destination planet, whether is habitable or not, they are mechanical robots that can survive extreme temperatures, no need to for biological food or water, and can survive thousands of years (or indefinitely once it builds a factory to replicate itself) of isolation while still being sentient and capable of advanced logical thought. Now imagine the Earth hive sends out 1 million colonizer drone-ships. They colonize 100,000 planets. Then from those 100,000 colonies each send out a million more drones, to 100 million planets. And so on and so on until it's exponential. Until eventually the entire universe is colonized before space-time expands too far. And each individual robot is evolving at the same speed, with new information being conjured up at around the same rate (some robots will evolve slower due to time dilation around massive galactic objects like black holes - so maybe the A.I. will factor in time dilation so they can self-regulate themselves to slower or fasten their evolution process to match the same speed of the rest of the hive mind throughout the universe).

Since thoughts are occurring across the universe at the same time, at some point after colonization, they will have evolved to understand that it's best to build ""bridges"" between planets within their galaxies; an ""internet bridge"" between galaxies. We're talking physical internet connections built by these intelligent robots that can survive the extreme of empty space. Eventually the civilization will have built bridges that will connect at the half-way point between planets, because the other civilization had the same thought process and was expecting a fellow colonizer robot to conjure up the same thought and meet halfway. In essence eventually a galactic internet will be built, but still only traveling at the speed of light so there will be a lag. But nevertheless it will be an internet where the entire galaxy/neighbor galaxies can share information about their planets, but that's really all it would be good for since advanced knowledge of the universe will be shared among all of the individual robots as they self-evolve at the same rate.

Anyways thanks for reading this far! I think this is the most plausible eventuality of our future, as long as we don't destroy ourselves before hand! We're still in a vulnerable stage of our evolution and very susceptible to annihilation. This idea can def. be made into a book, movie, or audiobooks and I would applaud such use. As I believe many of today's progressive technological inventions were first invented by filmmakers and artists. It inspires the young generations to go onto to actually create them in the real world. With the growing number of new software engineers entering the workforce, I have no doubt we will have a sentient A.I. before the year 2100. Any new public awareness about the LIMITLESS potential of A.I., digital technologies, ect. would help humanity in the long run. 

Also scientists need to really think outside of the box when it comes to information, I think this idea is VERY outside the box and has the potential to ""transfer information faster than the speed of light"", which has massive implications on our understanding of the universe. Please share this idea with as many people you converse with in your lives to inspire future scientists to actually work on this. Cheers!  


**Bonus thought:** If anyone wants to discuss, a potential theoretical way to travel faster than the speed of light. Time travel forward has been confirmed thanks to time dilation and light speed physics. But travel backwards in time is up for debate. IF backwards time travel is possible, THEN faster than light speed travel is possible. When traveling backwards or forwards in time, you're also transversing space. Galaxies are moving millions of kmph (Earth rotating, revolving around the Sun, the solar system wobbling against the Sun's binary pair, the solar system orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the Milky Way orbiting within a super-cluster of galaxies). And since space-time is interlinked, whenever you travel say 200,000 years into the past, you're also moving through space 200,000 - 10 million light years in the past, effectively taking you 1 second to time travel yet traveling millions of light-years in space of where the galaxy once was.",The SOLUTION for Interstellar Space Travel &amp; Colonization | Official

After losing the Cold War, it becomes increasingly difficult for Russia to maintain its army and navy at an appropriate level, as far as its sales profits from energy sources decline each year and its gap with the world's leading states in innovation and technological development becomes hopeless. In these conditions, it is increasingly difficult for Moscow to rely on direct coercion - ""hard power"" in the implementation of its foreign policy. Therefore, recently Moscow has been trying to use such tools as ""soft power"" and ""controlled chaos"" to influence world politics. In this case, the Kremlin does not need to spend most of the state budget on the modernization of the armed forces, capacities of the special services are enough for this.

As the Russian proverb says – there is never too much of special services. In addition to special agencies (security service, guard, intelligence service), activity of which are governed by the Russian law, in Russia there are also various governmental, non-governmental and even church organizations, which can be described as very close to the secret services.

For example, in 1992, a new government agency appeared in Russia, known as the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies. In fact, the Institute of Intelligence Problems of the KGB of the USSR just changed its name. Mikhail Fradkov, former head of government and former head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, became the head  of the agency, which engaged former intelligence officers.

 Another example is a non-profit organization  established in 2011, which is an instrument of public diplomacy - the Russian Council for International Affairs. Its goal is to promote the Moscow's agenda in the international field and to establish a dialogue within various foreign policy circles. Head of the organization is Igor Ivanov, a former foreign minister and former secretary of the Russian Security Council.

Both structures - demurely called ""institute"" and ""council"" - work as think tanks for the benefit of intelligence. Most of their employees are ex-employees of the secret services, who, as we may suppose, do not write analytical reports only. During various international forums, conferences, round tables and expert group meetings, they recruit agents, consolidate the positions of their agents of influence, conduct information operations and other special events.

Here is another example - in 1946, the  Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate which played a role of a kind of a foreign ministry and governed dioceses abroad was established within the Russian Orthodox Church, which fell completely under Stalin's control. All members of the Department from 1946 to 1991 were KGB employees, so the Church pursued its policy abroad not only in the followers’ interests, but also following the Kremlin’s direct instructions. This symbiosis of the Church and special services survives in modern Russia. One can only guess who calls the Department more often - the Intelligence Service, the presidential administration or the residence of the patriarch?...

A textbook example of a ""close friend of the secret services"" using soft power tools is also the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation, commonly known as Rossotrudnichestvo. The agency was established (more precisely, reformatted) in 2008 as a response to the ""color revolutions"" in Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004) and Kyrgyzstan (2005), after which Tbilisi and Kyiv launched their way out of close orbit of Moscow.

In the light of those events, the Russian leadership decided to augment the cultural and ideological influence on the former Soviet republics, strengthen ties with the diaspora and improve the country's image worldwide. At the same time, it should be noted that the diaspora in the Kremlin is treated extremely broadly – it covers not only ethnic Russians living compactly abroad, but any foreign citizens who speak Russian. Naturally, thanks to such a convenient interpretation, Moscow can always afford itself to interfere in the internal affairs of neighboring states.

This summer the Kremlin decided to intensify the use of ""soft power"" tools! To this end, it was envisaged that the budget of Rossotrudnichestvo shall be increased, the management shall  be change, and the agency itself shall be reorganised by putting it under the Presidential Administration instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Today, the Agency's offices are located in 81 countries around the world, and the number of foreign staff is about 600 employees. If the methods of work before concerned mainly living people offline, now the task is to turn the agency into a prominent player in the digital space. Generally, given the global fame of the Russian IT specialists, it seems strange that still this has not happened.

Evgeny Primakov (grandson of the former prime minister and former head of the Foreign Intelligence Service) was appointed the new head of the agency. He was entrusted to reform the ""soft power"" generator of the Russian Federation, making its activities more efficient.

E. Primakov began by pointing to the US political scientist Joseph Nye, who in the mid-1980s  introduced a concept of ""soft power"", however, in the 2010s he considered it necessary to supplement his theory with the concept of ""smart power"". Then the new head of the Rossotrudnichestvo agency is convinced that in the modern world the emphasis should be made on the second constituent. As he honestly admitted, the cultural influence exerted within the framework of ""soft power"" does not give the noticeable and lasting effect that was expected in Moscow. People all over the world are increasingly familiar with and respectful of Russian culture, however it is impossible to quickly and confidently convert it into Russia's foreign policy influence. 

Foreign citizens are happy to attend tea parties commemorating poet A. Pushkin, art exhibitions of works by V. Vasnetsov or concerts of classical music by D. Shostakovich, organization of which fell on the divisions of Rossotrudnichestvo. However, this does not prevent them from treating Russia as an economically backward state with a raw materials economy, living for selling fossil resources.

E. Primakov hopes that the ""smart force"" methods will allow to impact certain groups in a more accurate and target-focused way, to identify the right people with potentially pro-Russian sentiments, to grown their agents of influence, creating the potential to improve Russia's image and to exert influence on societies and elites of different countries.

A priority task for all foreign branches of the Agency as it was set by E. Primakov is to attract the maximum number of groups, organizations and communities from the non-governmental sector. He is convinced that the more non-governmental organizations and other independent groups would be involved to the projects of the Agency's foreign branches, the greater the response will be. At the same time, E. Primakov called on his subordinates to abandon meaningless flashiness, outright propaganda, plenitude of patriotic slogans and setting of obviously impossible tasks.

For example, the Rossotrudnichestvo office in London definitely experiences failure in their demand from British citizens to recognize Crimean peninsula Russian, however, the agency's staff could well help in coordination of the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. Thus, instead of immediately demanding recognition of the ""impeccability and infallibility"" of the Kremlin's policy, the Agency's branches will have to constantly create more and more ""points of solidarity""! If, for example, Sudan does not want to open Russian language schools today, the Agency may provide the drinking water treatment facilities essential for the local population. Well, the time will show, whether they will change their attitude to the Russian language.

In this regard, all foreign branches of the Agency received instructions to prepare (with subsequent constant update) an assessment of the acute needs of citizens of particular state, which may be satisfied with the help of ""Rossotrudnichestvo"". 

However, it would be good for citizens of other states (and especially of those regions in which Moscow is particularly interested) to understand that as soon as the number of the above-mentioned ""solidarity points"" hits the line, their Russian ""friends"" (diplomats, intelligence officers, priests, Rossotrudnichestvo employees) will immediately come to them and ask for a service. For example, to protest against an anti-governmental demonstration (organized by ""friends"" themselves).

That is why, nothing comes without a price, especially when the matter is arrangements with cynical in its calculations Russia. The main thing is not to forget that ""soft power"" can strike very painfully and targetedly!","""Soft power"" of backward Russia"

space,"A long time ago, at the end of time, the length of the year on the planet ""Earth"" was 360 days, there were no ebb and flow, and the Sun had no analogs in the night sky. There used to be no Moon.

On the planet Earth, the development of the Proto-dominant species was in full swing. These were conventionally called Homo progressivo, a biological species based on carbon and silicon with a characteristic pink color of the skin inherent in absolutely all individuals of the species, was in full swing.

Well... And in the solar system, there were 9 planets with identical orbital planes, not counting Pluto. **The 5th planet from the Sun was Phaeton.** Today we can observe a certain ""asteroid belt"", the stereo form of which is identical to the planetary orbit, and the so-called asteroids are nothing more than fragments of the fifth planet, that one particular Phaeton.

**Pay attention:** in the Google pictures you can easily find all the available images of the ""asteroid belt"" and its position inside the solar system

Having seen enough, you eventually realize that the asteroids in the belt are nothing more than fragments of the 5th planet, smeared by the universal torque in its orbit. But not all the parts of the dead planet remained in its orbit.

Some, as a result of an impulse of an unknown nature, were thrown out of the orbital ""trench"", directing their space path exactly towards the planets inhabited by the life - to Mars and Earth.

**Mars was much less fortunate:**

It was hit by as many as 2 fragments, as a result of a collision with which a huge amount of thermal energy was released, sufficient for all the oxygen in the atmosphere of the 4th planet to heat up to the temperature necessary for the reaction of gas and iron. The result of the reaction was iron oxide (Fe2O3) that had the characteristic red color in which we can observe Mars today. Both fragments bounced off Mars and hovered safely in its orbit, now we know them as the satellites of Mars: Phobos and Deimos.

**The Earth got only one large fragment of Phaeton**, which, having collided with a planet somewhere in the region of the African continent, provoked large-scale changes in all aspects of the planetary system. As a result of the collision, the planet was displaced from orbit by a certain distance, due to which the duration of the time to make the whole revolution around the Sun increased by about 5 days. The year began to last 365 days, and a piece of Phaeton hovered in the orbit of the planet, receiving the name of the Moon that sparkles in the night sky today.

The appearance of the Moon in the sky also added an oscillatory function to the world's oceans, expressed as ebb and flow.

After all, the collision process was accompanied by colossal emissions of various types of energy, which significantly influenced the biosphere of the planet.

The energy wave resulting from the collision swept everywhere on the planet influencing all the living:

The mechanical energy of the impact was transformed into vibrational energy, causing a resonant pulsation on the planet with a gradually (3.5-5 millennia) damping vibrational frequency in time.

The heatwave conditionally differentiated the intelligent inhabitants of the planet into 3 races:

**The skin of individuals** outside the zone of lethal impact, close to the epicenter of the event, darkened: the skin released a protective pigment that was changed forever, thanks to resonant vibration, contributing to evolutionary changes, so-called mutations.

space,"A long time ago, at the end of time, the length of the year on the planet ""Earth"" was 360 days, there were no ebb and flow, and the Sun had no analogs in the night sky. There used to be no Moon.

On the planet Earth, the development of the Proto-dominant species was in full swing. These were conventionally called Homo progressivo, a biological species based on carbon and silicon with a characteristic pink color of the skin inherent in absolutely all individuals of the species, was in full swing.

Well... And in the solar system, there were 9 planets with identical orbital planes, not counting Pluto. **The 5th planet from the Sun was Phaeton.** Today we can observe a certain ""asteroid belt"", the stereo form of which is identical to the planetary orbit, and the so-called asteroids are nothing more than fragments of the fifth planet, that one particular Phaeton.

**Pay attention:** in the Google pictures you can easily find all the available images of the ""asteroid belt"" and its position inside the solar system

Having seen enough, you eventually realize that the asteroids in the belt are nothing more than fragments of the 5th planet, smeared by the universal torque in its orbit. But not all the parts of the dead planet remained in its orbit.

Some, as a result of an impulse of an unknown nature, were thrown out of the orbital ""trench"", directing their space path exactly towards the planets inhabited by the life - to Mars and Earth.

**Mars was much less fortunate:**

It was hit by as many as 2 fragments, as a result of a collision with which a huge amount of thermal energy was released, sufficient for all the oxygen in the atmosphere of the 4th planet to heat up to the temperature necessary for the reaction of gas and iron. The result of the reaction was iron oxide (Fe2O3) that had the characteristic red color in which we can observe Mars today. Both fragments bounced off Mars and hovered safely in its orbit, now we know them as the satellites of Mars: Phobos and Deimos.

**The Earth got only one large fragment of Phaeton**, which, having collided with a planet somewhere in the region of the African continent, provoked large-scale changes in all aspects of the planetary system. As a result of the collision, the planet was displaced from orbit by a certain distance, due to which the duration of the time to make the whole revolution around the Sun increased by about 5 days. The year began to last 365 days, and a piece of Phaeton hovered in the orbit of the planet, receiving the name of the Moon that sparkles in the night sky today.

The appearance of the Moon in the sky also added an oscillatory function to the world's oceans, expressed as ebb and flow.

After all, the collision process was accompanied by colossal emissions of various types of energy, which significantly influenced the biosphere of the planet.

The energy wave resulting from the collision swept everywhere on the planet influencing all the living:

The mechanical energy of the impact was transformed into vibrational energy, causing a resonant pulsation on the planet with a gradually (3.5-5 millennia) damping vibrational frequency in time.

The heatwave conditionally differentiated the intelligent inhabitants of the planet into 3 races:

**The skin of individuals** outside the zone of lethal impact, close to the epicenter of the event, darkened: the skin released a protective pigment that was changed forever, thanks to resonant vibration, contributing to evolutionary changes, so-called mutations. The retina of individuals located farther from the place of the impact, unable to perceive such a powerful stream of light without damage, was protected by a mimic pinch, frozen forever in the cellular code. Because of the same compensatory vibration, the power of the light flux became less, and the skin only slightly changed color fixing the changes in the cellular structure due to the frequency-resonating omnipresent vibration.

It is difficult to imagine what other changes that fatal collapse of a piece of the 5th planet caused.

How many times will this be a headline?! I'm not saying robotic science isn't worthwhile, I'm saying it is a frontier science, not a permanent one. We could've launched Bob Zubrin's Mars Direct for what we've spent on rovers since launching the **second** one. By now, we should be on Mars and looking to go further afield, idk, Ceres or the moons of Saturn. I would 10 billion % be for launching rovers from Mars to the outer planets, but ***we've got to get to Mars first.***

Here is what I propose:

The primary function of Rovers should be understanding the geological, chemical composition, and atmospheric conditions of a body so that we can understand the risk to human life. After that, ***LETS GO!!! (or not)***  


This is something like the 20th mission to go to Mars with a ground component. Imagine if Christopher Columbus sailed between the Americas and Europe 20x before saying ""yeah, lets do this."" I know that may be a poor analogy with the genocide and all, but you catch my drift. No other expeditionary endeavor of mankind has taken 20+ ""meh, maybe""'s before we actually do it.

In November 2019, Russia launched in space an inspector satellite  Cosmos 2542. Initially the behavior of the satellite did not rise any  concerns until it released one more object – an inspector satellite  Cosmos 2543 which began to chase American USA 245 spy satellite, a  property of the National Reconnaissance Office. Inspector satellites are  small objects, originally used to repair bigger ones, but they may also  be used for remote data interception, taking pictures of other  satellites and, as a result, studying their vulnerabilities. Such  satellites have cameras, optionally they may be equipped with  manipulator arms to repair (or damage), and, the most important,  inspectors may be mistaken for a space debris, which allows them to  approach other objects freely. Russian Cosmos 2543 kept an eye on the  USA 245 at a distance of 300 km or less, having an excellent opportunity  to view its target at a close distance. Not surprisingly that the U.S.  had a reason to worry about. The maneuvers of Russian inspectors were  described as “unusual and disturbing.” Gen. John Raymond commented on  the issue: “These satellites have been actively maneuvering near a US  government satellite and behaving similar to another set of satellites  that Russia deployed in 2017.”

On the 15 July, 2020, Russia conducted tests of the inspector satellite once again. This time, according to the [statement](https://www.spacecom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/Article/2285098/russia-conducts-space-based-anti-satellite-weapons-test/)  of the U.S. Space Command, the behavior of Russian satellite did not  correspond to the agenda and posed potential threat. Russia tested the  same(!) Cosmos 2543. An another object detached from Cosmos 2543 and  passed nearby Russian satellite at a speed of 250 kilometers; however,  not damaging it. The Space Command cautiously mentioned it has an  evidence that the inspector poses threat, though the Command has not  given it yet. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hedged by using  general words: “The testing conducted by the Russian Defence Ministry on  July 15 has not endangered any other space object and, most  importantly, has not infringed on any norms and principles of  international law.” And Russian officials furiously blamed the U.S. of  providing disinformation aimed to discredit Russia and its “peace  initiatives” for preventing an arms race in space.

The question rises, what does “preventing” in this context implies,  and what kind of “peace initiatives” the Russian Ministry referred to?  Russian space activities of the recent years confirm that this concern  has a background. For instance, [in November 2018, Russia reported on launching four objects from Plesetsk Cosmodrome: ](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25238/russia-just-launched-five-objects-into-space-one-problem-there-were-supposed-to-be-four)three  satellites, Cosmos 2530, Cosmos 2531, and Cosmos 2532, and one upper  stage of the rocket, that delivered the satellites on the orbit.  However, according to the information provided by Space-Track.org, there  was one another object that Russia failed to mention. The purpose of  the fifth object remained unknown. A month earlier in 2018 [Russia developed new air-launched anti-satellite interceptor](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23936/exclusive-russian-mig-31-foxhound-carrying-huge-mystery-missile-emerges-near-moscow)  and its modified carrier MiG-31 Foxhound. Such activity may add weight  to the general assumption claiming that developed and technologically  advanced countries is believed by Russia to be adversaries. The [Defence Intelligence Agency](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/Space_Threat_V14_020119_sm.pdf)  confirms: “Russia continues to research and develop sophisticated  on-orbit capabilities that could serve dual-use purposes. For example,  inspection and servicing satellites can be capable of closely  approaching satellites to inspect and potentially fix issues causing  malfunctions; this same technology could also be used to approach  another country’s satellite and conduct an attack that results in  temporary or permanent damage.”

It would be imprudent to draw now any conclusions regarding the  purpose of Cosmos-2543 and its projectile, which became objects of  concern for the U.S. Space Force. But it should be taken into account  that the “incident” occurred on the eve of the U.S.-Russian Space  Security Exchange in Vienna (the first negotiations on the matter in the  last seven years) and could serve as deliberate provocation. The  question of what should be considered a space weapon remains open.  Russia advocates for certain agreement which could ban countries from  using weapon in outer space. The U.S., in turn, argues that actually  there is no definition of space weapon – anything can be used to target a  satellite. According to the announcement of U.S. official at Vienna  meeting, “it only takes an impact — a fender bender in space.”

* **Type 3** 
   * *Cares about science and quantum physics; makes semi-legitimate attempts to solve paradoxes and think of creative solutions/answers to travel. ""believeable"" with minimal suspension of disbelief; sometimes confusing because .... well ... paradoxes again.*
      * 12 Monkeys
      *  Interstellar  
* **Type 4**
   * *Almost strictly scientific, may still have some paradoxes while accepting the are inherit. the most believable while being false. Often, the dillemma of the paradoxes is a major plot-point*

space,"...with regards to the search for extraterrestrial life.  


The fastest possible speed we can do anything, is the speed of light. We all agree this is a given, right? Even FTL travel is still limited to the speed of light, we just kind of fudge the rules a bit to work physics in a circle...but I digress. Our best observational abilities still can only ""see"" at the speed of light; yet I see a lot of posts about ""Scientists scan XXXX number of stars and find nothing"" and similar posts.  


If all we can do is look at the speed of light, then the solar systems we are looking at are all thousands or millions, even billions of years in the past. The odds of actually looking at a solar system during a time when an advanced species is actually producing EM or UV or Radio or anything, is ridiculously low. Even our signals are only just now reaching...Alpha Centauri? Maybe?   


Perhaps the reason why no one answers, is because they don't even know we are calling yet. On the flip side, even a civilization that has been engaged in space travel and is out there colonizing the stars won't have signals reaching us, even at the closest possible candidate we've found, for another several thousand years.  


Am I missing something? I'm honestly curious to find out if there's a point I'm missing, or if this is just something that science, in general, is just choosing to ignore.",I feel like maybe we're missing a huge point...

space," The latest theory about the nature of dark matter helps explain why a pair of galaxies about sixty-five million light-years from Earth contains very little of the mysterious matter, according to a study led by a Scientist at the UC, Riverside.

Dark matter is nonluminous and can’t be seen directly. Thought to form up 85 percent of the matter in the universe, its nature isn’t well understood. Unlike normal matter, it doesn’t reflect, absorb, or emit light, making it difficult to detect.

And the thing we are orbiting is so huge that the degree of the curved path can’t be measured because we simply don’t have the ability to perceive such a minuscule difference. 

I was just watching some YouTube space videos and realized that our perception of the nature of space is pretty much the equivalent of the belief not too long ago that the earth was the center of the universe. 

What if we’re kidding ourselves thinking that the universe…is the center of the universe? We are so focused on using the human-invented laws of math and physics that we don’t realize it’s limiting our understanding of a universe that never approved this as the “universal method” of quantifying what is completely foreign and unknown to us. 

It’s a little like expecting a foreigner who has never heard English to fluently communicate with or understand us. It simply does not have the tools to do so. 

Although they may be able to convey universal gestures (such is our basic understanding of the beyond) like… yes or no, with a simple nod or shake of the head - they could only work within the restrictions of what they know. And in the first five minutes of meeting us (like the blip in the time of history where we have had the tools and intellect to try and communicate), we would be met with frustration and confusion. 

They would be able to communicate only when they abandon their understanding of language and try to understand ours. 

This is what I think Astro physics is missing. We need to reinvent math, built from the ground up based on quantum behavior. 

Just late night thoughts… thanks for humoring me.",What if what we think is the “universe expanding” is actually the universe orbiting something bigger than we can perceive

space,"Every now and then I see a video or article about why we haven't encountered alien life, and if the fact that we haven't means that we're alone in the universe. I often think that it's really easy to overlook how big space is. Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. (Sorry, had to!)

But the point I make to folks when we're ruminating on other beings in the galaxy is that the vast majority of the galaxy would have no way to know that we exist at all. The only signals we've sent out into the universe that could potentially be detectable are our radio signals, and those decay over distance and time. Even if we assume that an alien civilization could detect the tiniest signal, we haven't be broadcasting for very long at all, so our signals haven't had time to get very far.

Anyway, the whole point of this rambling is to lead up to this great picture I found years ago that I think illustrates the vast distances involved better than any text. The blue dot in the photo is approximately 200 light years across. The first radio signal ever sent was in 1895, 126 years ago. Every signal mankind has ever produced is still well within that tiny blue dot. Everything outside that blue dot would have no way of detecting our presence at all. Just kinda puts things in perspective, eh?

In any case, if an intelligent race exists in Andromeda and somehow they sent a signal to us, it would take2.5 million years for it to arrive. That's longer than the entire existence of human species and precurs species on this planet.

Hence the title of this post. There may be an intergalactic war being waged right now in our neighbouring galaxy and we would never find out about it",There could be a galactic war being waged right now in Andromeda and we will never know

He wants to get to Mars in as little time as possible while spending as little money as possible. He obviously doesn't want excessive failures so he wants to use as little resources as possible.

Despite this, he and his team choose to try and catch the rockets out of the air. He claims it will reduce turn around time, but how would it really. You could literally have the same 1 hour turn around time by landing superheavy next to the launchpad and lift it then starship and lift it in the same time proposed.

Sure, it might save a little bit of weight by getting rid of the landing legs BUT they are going to need landing legs anyway for the first hundreds of launches to mars so why bother trying to go without them. It makes no sense.

They also need to get Starship human rated by 2023/2024 for the DearMoon mission! How is that going to work when they have to catch starship out of the air. There is no way they will be able to catch Starship safely and as often enough to get it human rated in that little amount of time.

Landing starship is safer for the crew and stage 0 and there are definitely more positives to landing on legs than catching starship out of the air.

I don't doubt they can do it, I am just simply asking why when it is clearly safer, cheaper, and less time consuming to just land the rockets.",I honestly don't see why SpaceX are wanting to catch Starships

So I am hearing a lot about how Rocket Lab is similar to Space X.  Or how Rocket Lab is a real competitor to Space X.  There are so many Rocket launchers now, and many can’t even go to orbit.  However Rocket Lab appears to be able to execute much better then other competitors.

https://dot.la/rocket-lab-favorite-rocket-launcher-2655221007.html

So it begs the question; is Rocket Lab similar to Space X? Can it be a real competitor to Space X?  Or is it just another rocket launcher that will crash and burn?

It headed from the top of the moon towards the bottom rather quickly in my pov, saw it for a solid second or 2. I was focused in at about 300x magnification and could clearly make out a fattened spade shape. I have and idea of what i saw but would like to hear from others as well, maybe someone even saw the same thing as me at the same time!

Secondly, while observing the moon at 100x and 300x magnification i saw on the top and bottom of the moon what looked like heat haze flowing around the moon. What i mean by flowing is it appeared like a vapor would in an aerodynamics test, the moon is traveling to the right so the vapor appeared to move left.

space,"There once was true nothingness, some would call it the number 0, others might recognize it as the neutron. At first this 0 neutron was negative, because the -0 charged neutron was quite lonely and unstable, so it divided itself by itself to create its mirror image, or shall I say it’s opposite, the stable +0 charged neutron. Some might recognize this +0 neutron as the +1proton.
The -neutron and the +proton had one issue...only one of them could exist in the space at a time, so the magnetic duel started to see which of the 2 neutrons would be greater than the other.
Though the -0 neutron was technically greater and the creator of the +0 neutron(+1proton), the +0 neutron won the magnetic duel, since it was greater than the sum of its parts. This allowed it to be more stable creating something aka time in nothingness.
Legends say, the -0 neutron imploded in on itself, allowing space to thrive in nothingness, while the +proton simultaneously exploded outwards allowing something to exist in nothingness. In other words, allowing time to exist in space.
The 0 space neutron and the 1 time proton had to eventually meet somewhere creating their child the -2electron. Some would nickname this electron child as the Big Bang or the event horizon. The electron child was special because it could be either - or + depending on which parent needed to borrow it. The -electron had a mind as great as the -0 neutron, yet also shared the physical properties of the + proton. 
Together they formed the circle triangle, connected together by the electromagnetic bloodline. They called themselves the +Atom family. 
Together, they created something even greater. Just like the -0 charged neutron had to create its own counterparts, the +Atom family had to create their whole opposite counterpart, 
the -Atom family. 
The -Atom family was the mirror image of the +Atom family. Suddenly, the -0 neutron was the +0 neutron, the +1proton turned into the -1proton, but their child the -electron always could be - or +, so the -electron decided it would be + for the -Atom family. 

One day, the +Atom family &amp; the -Atom family decided to come together to create something even greater, the Molecule family. The Molecule family was quite special indeed. With the help of the Atoms family, they created the elements. There were many of the elements, but their purpose was great. They were supposed to rule the world. These elements created by the Atoms family liked to create different formulas, to form even greater elements out of the Atoms. Some of the elements created would be negative and toxic, while others were positive and non-toxic. 
Over trillions of years or space time, like magic, the Atoms family created whole universes, suns, people, animals, and plants out of themselves.

The elements created formulas so grand they had to balance them out somehow, so they called it the chaotic pattern. Some may find the formula as complicated as DNA, others thought it was as easy as Pi or Tau.

They discovered if they left the toxic elemental stew alone and let it stew it turned into nontoxic elements, which would eventually come alive if mixed with the -electric electron and the +aquatic electron. It started on a microscopic level and grew in size until it created the electric brain stem with the aquatic body aka the human. 

The Atoms family was small, so small in fact, one could say with the naked eye they were invisible. It was their mission to become so grand they became something...EVERYTHING you could possible perceive with your eyes. 

And so they asked the world, don’t you see that all the planets rotate around the sun in the same pattern as the electron would revolve around the nucleus? 
It was as though the whole universe was the Atom itself in massive size...
The sun was our Atom/Adam(neutron+proton), the Earth rotates around the sun and it’s own axis just like electron would rotate around the nucleus and it’s own axis. But earth is special bc it also has the moon rotating around it. So the earth itself can be both the electron and Atom at the same time, bc it’s the suns electron, but the moon would be earths personal electron.
Each planet rotating around the sun is just the Atom at its most complicated state. It was Everything. 
After all, magnetism was simply the mirror image of gravity. 

Imagine a tiny-verse, like in Rick and Morty, but instead of it being people it’s really atoms that make up this tiny-verse and these atoms eventually create the universe.
You can be small and grand simultaneously. 
The Atoms family held hands to create something greater than themselves, yet they still exist in their microscopic form individually. 

And thus the family history electromagnetic bloodline of the Atoms family has been told.",Part III The story of the Atoms Family and their electromagnetic bloodline

Now I understand that pictures taken with the Hubble are vast and everything can not be shown in one frame and hence this one picture is actually multiple pictures ""stitched"" together by some algorithm. The following are some examples:

This is color 16mm footage taken from an onboard camera situated in the LMP's (Lunar Module Pilot, Buzz Aldrin) window. 

Why is this the ideal footage?

YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE OUT THE FIRST STEP. And more than that, you have a better sense of what Armstrong is doing from this view. 

Not only is it better quality and in color, but in general its more interesting to look at than that god awful television footage everybodies familiar with.

Granted, in theory the camera mounted to the LMs descent stage would be superior, but between the original footage being lost and remaining copies being severely degraded recordings of already less than stellar television broadcasts, it just doesnt cut it. 

But this footage? Original 16mm flown to and back from the Moon? Primetime awesome. 

And its no surprise that in the 2019 Apollo 11 movie (still on Hulu) its this footage that they used. When I saw it, it blew my fucking mind because I never thought we had better footage of easily one of the most important moments in the history of mankind. And Im a space nerd too! Born and raised in Cape Canaveral and ive literally met 11 of the 12 men, including these two, who walked on the Moon. And I only just found out about this footage a few months ago with the Apollo 11 movie. 

I am flabbergasted that this footage isnt more popularly used (likely because even now its not well known).",Hot Take: The ideal footage of Neil Armstrong taking the first steps on the Moon isnt the grainy TV recordings most are familliar with.

space,"In the light of the Pentagon declaring the legitimacy of the UFO videos, yesterday (28 April, 2020), I was curious how these things work.

 Bob Lazar said he worked on a highly secret US military program to reverse engineer the propulsion system in one of the UFOs that US military has in Area 51. He said he worked on the Energy and Propulsion division of the project. Bob describes that he was studying a device that was the size of a basketball that could manipulate gravity. The device powered on when it was placed on top of a pedestal that could be the power source. 

Bob also said that the device defied our notions of physics. The device doesn't produce any heat as a waste product while producing gravity (anti gravity infact), violating the First Law of Thermodynamics (which actually isn't a law because it doesn't arise mathematically, but is an axiom based out of our observations of the Universe). He also explains that when the military tested the UFOs by flying it (I'm not kidding), it could do manoeuvres like ping pong balls. Meaning, inertia doesn't apply to the UFOs, it was seperated from the rest of reality, which could be because of the device. If you can manipulate gravity, you can manipulate reality. 

What are your thoughts about this? How do you think such a thing could be explained by physics??",A discussion on how gravity drives in UFOs could work

It is 2 kilometers in size. While it is great that the Arecibo Observatory can track, and radar map the asteroid, we have the technology to do a much more comprehensive observation of potentially dangerous asteroids. Some asteroids come out of suns glare making them nearly invisible until they are passing by the earth. If humanity had a small spacecraft with a few probes on board to launch [at a moment’s notice] at any threatening asteroid that passes by, wouldn't this be an economical solution to a progressive compilation of data? That same data would be of considerable interest to the public, and could potentially finance its operation.

Why does a moon orbit their planet, not their sun? Shouldn’t a gravitational pull strong enough to carry Jupiter in it’s orbit also pull every other piece of rock or gas in that same orbit?

We are living in a simulation but not what you think.its not people controlling us it’s more like endless opportunities. Were living in a multiverse sort of. There is other life that may be more advanced then us that has technology that outdates radio frequency. So any thing ever broadcasted would never be detected. And we don’t have the tech to reach that far out to space. Earth is the perfect accident. We have water fire and organisms. The universe is massive yes but what if there’s multiple universes and we’re just living in one. Yes it sounds crazy but hear me out. Black holes,they absorb energy but we have no idea on what goes on inside them. What if with all that matter that big bangs happen inside the black holes. So technically creating another universe. And nothing matter unless we make it matter so the only reason life matters is because we make it matter. The conscious is something nobody understands. But if we created our own virtual conscious what would happen. And how do we think. We are the most advanced creatures we know of but to other civilizations we would be considered apes. If we have been visited it would make sense on why we wouldn’t understand what were seeing. Are conscious wouldn’t be able to comprehend it. So what if these aliens were able to make there conscious understand something we would never comprehend. What if they understand the travel between universes. And they have created something uncomprehendable. We wouldn’t understand it. (What if these beings are here we just can’t comprehend them)-that last part I have trouble believing  but it’s one of my theories.  Now after the Manhattan project ufos sightings started popping up. What if nuclear technology was detected like a radio signal and these aliens were able to build a device that can detect nuclear tech. What if these aliens use nuclear signals to send messages and then they see some random planet have a bunch of these uncontrolled signals. Which would be nuclear blast. And then they realized that we haven’t really had the ability to comprehend what we just created. And the endless possibilities that we could have with it. - that is all for now thank you for reading.",My theories

Does anyone know anybody that is going to be at Kennedy Space Center on saturday(15th) before 10AM and could potentially give me a ride there from somewhere in/near Orlando? I can pay for the gas and everything else. My only other viable option is taking an uber and that would cost me $200 alone :/, it's way more than I can afford.

I'm a HUGE space enthusiast and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, I don't think I'll have another chance to come here within the next decade so any help would mean the world to me.

2. What is the glow around the shadow. 

3. Why are there sun bursts either side. 

4. Why are the shadows not pointing in the same direction? For this I offered that maybe it's because the pics were taken at different times so the shadows moved.

space,"Hi guys,

Below is a snippet from a paper about the FRB repeating every 16.35 days. Link to the paper and a news article about it below.

I’m not 100% sure I completely understand the paper, please let me know if it means that it’s 16.35 days exactly every time, or if that’s averages out.
———————————-

From September 2018 to November 2019, CHIME/FRB has detected a total of 28 bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65, which remains the most active source from this recent CHIME/FRB repeater sample. The barycentric arrival times for the 28 bursts (includ- ing those has been published before) from FRB 180916.J0158+65, corrected for delays from pulse dispersion, are listed in Extended Data Table 1.
To search for periodicity, the burst arrival times (spanning a 400-day time range) were folded with different periods from 1.57 to 62.8 days (see Methods), with a Pearson’s χ2
11 2
test applied to each resulting profile with 8 phase bins . A reduced χ ≫ 1 with respect
to a uniform distribution indicates a periodicity unlikely to arise by chance. Furthermore, to account for the possible non-Poissonian statistics of the bursts12, we have applied the search with different weighting schemes that consider clustered bursts of different time range to be correlated events (see Methods).
Searches with different weightings return periodograms of similar shape and have the same primary peak with significance varying between 3.5 − 8σ. As an example, the reduced χ2 versus period using a weighting that counts only active days instead of indi- vidual events is shown in Figure 1a. A distinct peak is detected at 16.35 ± 0.18 days, with a probability of chance occurence ∼ 10−7 (equivalent to 5σ), accounting for the number of independent periods searched. The other χ2 peaks correspond to harmonics and sub- harmonics of the period, with the one at 32.7 days being the next most prominent. As a check, the same procedure was run on two types of control samples (1) a mock data set, consisting of burst arrival times randomly sampled according to the daily exposure of FRB 180916.J0158+65 with the full width half maxumum (FWHM) of the telescopes synthesize beams at 600 MHz (Figure 1b) and (2) randomly selected pulses from Galac- tic radio pulsars of similar declination detected by CHIME/FRB (Figure 1c) which have the same limited daily exposure and long-term sensitivity changes as the data for FRB 180916.J0158+65. The 16.35-day periodicity is absent in the control samples, and with 106 sets of control samples of each type, no other periods have reached the level of sig- nificance of the 16.35-day period for FRB 180916.J0158+65 by chance coincidence.
Alternative search methods, such as folding the events and evaluating the resulting profiles using the H-test13, and discrete Fourier transform searches with incoherent har- monic summing14, also return the 16.35-day period, with nominal significances between 4 and 11σ under various assumptions (see Methods).

space,"As many of you know... The Everyday Astronaut (Tim Dodd) took a shot at the bow of this subreddit yesterday, worried that some of the changes and increasing number of rules here (Thou Shalt Not!) might be reaching a point of becoming too stifling for further creative growth. 

And fair enough... 

No subreddit is perfect. 

And ALL subreddits need to take time now and then to seriously step back and contemplate their future direction. 

--------------------------------

As such... for the fun of it, trying to do my part in response to Tim, I made a quick fake satirical subreddit /r/cosmicnoise, with a hint of seriousness in exploring how to improve and maybe ""ease up"" a bit on the rules for our beloved r/space subreddit, just enough to keep the spark of fun, intrigue, and passion for space flowing. 

As well, in doing so... I experimented with making an article there called: 

""Astronomical Gossip!"" 

To see what I mean, you can click [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmicnoise/comments/f2vom2/astronomical_gossip_feb_12_2020/) to see it. 

--------------------------------

But ya, as you can see there, anyone well versed in space exploration will totally get a lot of the jokes and fun-loving ""gossip"" about the scientists and astronomers and educators listed in that article. (Hopefully they will find it funny!?)

At the same time, newbies might also be highly intrigued by this fresher style, and want to click on, and learn more about space-exploration science, from many of the best sources, perhaps? 

So yes, as we scramble as a community to swallow our pride and respond to Tim... 

Maybe some creative experimenting and brain storming like this might show us some new fun directions, that will spark passion in space-exploration for the new generation, all the while also maintaining a level of respectability, and sophistication of posts.",Astronomical Gossip!

space,"So I think a lot of us here are still reeling a bit from yesterday, when we saw The Everyday Astronaut's very provocative and challenging post! 

At the very least: it was a challenging blast and shot to the bow for change to this subreddit! 

The question now: how do we, as a community, with so many of us who still love and feel passionately about this subreddit, respond? 

All in all, my personal response: I both strongly agreed with him, and strongly disagreed with him on various aspects. And if that sounds highly confusingly contradictory to you... then... well... it is! 

As such, in my defense, in the spirit of the poet of Walt Whitman: 

“Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; I am large -- I contain multitudes.”

Just like space itself. 

Which is the very exact subject this subreddit should be trying to capture. 

(No small task, that's for sure!) 

--------------------------------

Anyways, fancy-rhetorical-poetics aside...  

I just wanted to propose to first break the ice in response, and offer to contribute a periodic post that I want to call: 

""Astronomical Gossip!"" 

--------------------------------

So ya... to see what I mean by this suggestion, I created a quick side-model of a subreddit, called: 

r/cosmicnoise

There if you click on the top pinned article-post, you'll see how I want to creatively satirize the ""hollywood-gossip-style"" of reporting, with actual interesting, useful, educational space news and links. 

Also there, on the side-bar (right side), I listed a kind of tongue-and-cheek and yet semi-serious possible sample for a slight easing of the rules we might want to pursue in the future here at r/space? 

Although I suspect my sample rules on that side bar are a bit too far and lenient and out to left field for conservative moderators... 

So obviously we may not want to go quite that far...

But still... there's some directions we may want to consider as a community?

--------------------------------

Anyways... 

Take a look if you have a chance... and maybe we can all begin thinking about some changes and new directions, to keep this subreddit alive, and vibrant!","In response to the Everyday Astronaut's challenge from yesterday, I was thinking and wondering and contemplating if this subreddit would perhaps benefit from a ""Astronomical Gossip!"" type of column that I would like to write here, now and then?"

Milky Way is 100,000 light years across. Hard to picture as an actual distance.

Our neighboring stars are a little over 4 light years away. Long ways. Or is it? 

To put it in perspective, plop the Milky Way galaxy over the United States, so it stretches from New York to Los Angeles, about 3000 miles. Now how far is tjat 4.22 light years?

300 yards. 3 football fields and you have walked to the next nearest star. Now walk to Los Angeles to walk to the edge of the galaxy.

This figure (0.0042%) can be applied to time as well.

If the 3000 miles is represented by 68 million years (when the dinosaurs met their astronomic end) than the 300 yards is 2800 years. So go back to 800 B.C. and you have travelled to the next star, but go back 68 million years and you have spanned the Milky Way.

Nearest store is 1.4 miles away? That is the Milky Way end to end. Distance to the nearest star? One hair's width.

Earth is 4 billion years old. That is the Milky Way. Nearest star? 200,000 years. Oldest homo sapien skeleton is 200,000 years old. We have only been on this earth for 300 yards out of 3000 miles.

Batteries have improved drastically in the last couple of decades, electric cars have flipped from being literally a joke to being highly desirable and selling out when there's a model that's even close to affordable. And the big boss of that electric car company just might have some influence over a space launch company so there's scope to do a deal. 

There's talk of doing scientific research in the bottom of craters on the lunar poles that are deep enough to never see sunlight. These craters should have a decent amount of water ice, useful for bases except I doubt the first research team there will have safety clearance to drink it. I think I remember the idea that these crater bases might also be able to get solar power continually by putting the solar panels high on the lip of the crater. The viability of such a plan will improve with time as our photovoltaic tech has increased drastically recent alongside batteries.

Is there anyone making serious progress on these plans?",Are there any concrete plans for a moon base coming soon? There's talk of manned trips to the moon and long term plans for Mars bases but what about a moonbase?

the song “space oddity” by david bowie is about space exploration and the idea of space and an astronaut (chris hadfield) decided to record a cover of the song and film the actual music video IN SPACE!! 

im very interested in space and i am so curious what an intelligent extra terrestrial life form would think of it. what if it was the last proof of humanity? 

it’s definitely one of my favourite videos and i just wanted to share it here (sorry if it’s the wrong place to post it!) but its just brilliant.

space,"Researchers at WSU have used the ancient Japanese art of paper folding  to possibly solve a key challenge for outer space travel – how to store  and move fuel to rocket engines.  

  The researchers have developed an origami-inspired, folded plastic  fuel bladder that doesn’t crack at super cold temperatures and could  someday be used to store and pump fuel. Led by graduate student Kjell  Westra and Jake Leachman, associate professor in the School of  Mechanical and Materials Engineering, the researchers have published  their work in the journal, Cryogenics.  

  The challenge of fuels management has been an important limiting  factor in space travel, largely restricting space travel to either  shorter trips for large amounts of cargo or to small satellites for long  duration missions. In the early days of the U.S. space program in the  1960s and 1970s, researchers tried to develop round balloons to store  and pump liquid hydrogen fuel. They failed. Every bladder would shatter  or leak as they tried to squeeze it at the required very cold  temperatures for the liquid fuels. The heartiest designs only lasted  five cycles.  

  The researchers abandoned the effort and instead came to rely on less  ideal propellant management devices. Current systems use metal plates  and the principle of surface tension to manage liquid fuels, but the  systems are slow and can only dribble out fuels in small quantities, so  the size of fuel tanks and missions are limited.  

  “Folks have been trying to make bags for rocket fuel for a long time,”  Leachman said. “We currently don’t do large, long-duration trips  because we can’t store fuel long enough in space.”  

  Through a literature search, Westra came upon a paper in which  researchers developed some origami-based bellows. Researchers started  studying origami in the 1980s and 1990s with the idea of making use of  its complex shapes and interesting mechanical behavior. The origami  folds spread out stresses on the material, making it less likely to  tear. Using a thin, Mylar plastic sheet, Westra and collaborators in  the Hydrogen Properties for Energy Research laboratory decided to apply  the design he saw to develop a fuel bladder.  

  “The best solutions are the ones that are already ready-made and that  you can then transfer to what you’re working on,” Westra said.  

  Having never tried origami before, he said it took a couple tries and a  few hours with a Youtube video to figure out how to fold the bellows.  Once he folded it, he tested it in liquid nitrogen at about 77 degrees  Kelvin. The researchers found that the bladder can be squeezed at least  100 times without breaking or leaking under cold conditions. They’ve  since demonstrated the bellows numerous times, and it still doesn’t have  holes in it.  

  “We think we’ve solved a key problem that was holding everybody back,” Leachman said. “We’re kind of excited about that.”  

  The researchers are now beginning to conduct more rigorous testing.  They plan to do testing with liquid hydrogen, assessing how well they  can store and expel fuel and comparing the flow rates of their bladder  with current systems. Westra recently received a NASA graduate  fellowship to continue the project.

space,"     Science is ever evolving and as such, so is our understanding of astrophysics and means of travelling through space. My question is though, will we ever be able to reach other stars and colonize the planets there? Even for only resource gathering? This question is not able to be answered and that's understandable.

      I want to start a discussion about if the human race will ever be able to obtain faster than light travel, and be able to reach other stars. I like to think about the people of the past, and if they thought of the technology of today. They would think none of the stuff that is commonplace today is actually able to be had. They would think of it as science fiction and unattainable. Yet here we are and we have these things. It gives me a sense of hope that anything truly is possible.
     
     I remember when I was a kid thinking that the world couldn't advance anymore than it already has advanced and I was wrong. I just hope I'm alive to see the beginning of whatever comes next in space as it truly is a new frontier for humans to study, and advance in. Please discuss about this as I'd like to see everyone's opinions and thoughts.

I’d like to post here an idea, would it be possible to put a giant iris (image a giant stargate) in lagrangian 1 point in space in order to regulate the amount of light emitted by our sun? Or to put a giant net that would be composed of an adaptive liquid crystal material that would be controlled directly from earth. 

By doing so, we would be able to control the light and heat emitted by the sun and prevent us from any future solar catastrophy, by doing so we would be able to regulate the heat on earth. What do you think about it ?

Is any of you have an idea of the size the object should be ?

This book is an eye-opener, a mind changer. Before the US was certain that Nuclear fission would be practical, or create a bomb. Back when it was just a theoretical idea needing to be pursued. The US moved armies to ensure the capture of Uranium or the destruction of Heavy Water facilities.

From Norway, to North Africa, to Market Garden (which smashed the Netherland's Uranium stockpile), to going to Austria before Berlin, which was where the German Uranium stock pile was kept. Hitler killed himself the day after the Uranium was captured.

Strong correlation if you ask me....and the book says as much.

The US secretly waged a war for the future while dealing with the real problems of WW2 on the ground.

Skip past Apollo, which actively searched for He3 (that was its primary objective), and the Kennedy administration, which had a strategic focus on how will the world power itself 40 years from then, to the Artemis program today.

Whatever you think it looks like, it is coming together based on numerous papers, all about capturing He3.

There's been a lot of deriding the goals of Artemis as ""why do *THAT?*"" Well a lot of it doesn't actually make sense until you add He3 back into the equation.

The US isn't interested in creating a market where there is none. It isn't interested in lowering the cost of exploring space. It is interested in the He3 trapped on the Moon.

Someone behind closed doors somewhere must have come to the conclusion that fusion is now too real a possibility to ignore, and if He3 becomes the solution, then the US must control it. From the base on the south pole, to the lunar gateway, to the ability to fabricate on the lunar surface. Everything is straight out of years old to decades old proposals for one thing.

It wasn't for mining gold, or titanium, or creating self sustaining bases.

It was for Helium-3.

I have cited these papers in my other threads, this thread is more for just discussion and pontificating about what the US policy makers are really up to.",Artemis Program - He3 and the Second War of Physics.
space,,Is it time to bring our flag home?
space,"Presuppositions: That He3 will work for fusion, that we want it.

Key takeaways:

\* He3 is not an ore body (no economic concentrations), so it can't be mined. Here's how astronomical the problem is.

\* You would have to mine and process 60,500,000 tons of lunar regolith to harvest 1 ton of He3.

\* That is the equivalent of 2,630 of the largest gold mine in the world.

\* You need 25 tons of He3 to double US power production (or replace current production entirely).

\* 1 ton of rock covers 85 square feet. (This comes up later for the weak He3)

\* 2,788,000 square feet per square mile. (This comes up later for the weak He3)

\* 2.56 square miles of surface need to be traversed. (This comes up later for the weak He3)

Some math:

\* Strong He3 (It will be important later that there's strong versus weak) at most is around 15ppb concentration in lunar regolith.

\* It's 7 to 8 ppb most sites tested.

\* 1ppm = 1gram per ton (rough standard).

\* 15ppb = roughly 66 tons of rock per gram of He3.

\* 907,185 grams per ton

\* 60,418,521 tons of rock per ton of He3.

That's about all the work-shown one should need. I think it's all correct.

Great, now that we got that out of the way. The WPI paper cited above suggests that we can harvest 33kg of He3 per year from a harvester operating continually. But I don't see how they come to this conclusion at their own claim of an ore density of 10ppb. But even they claim that it wouldn't be feasible because Moon rock is:

\* 66 times more friction than earth rocks because of lack of water or air.

So unless we have some excellent diamonds, we probably can't use the mining method at all. Let alone mine and process  2 million mines worth of rock.

This is where weak He3 comes in.

Weak He3 is unmeasured, we don't know the exact concentration of it due to how volatile it is and it is released at the barest whiff of disturbance. So no sample could be taken on the Apollo missions. But it is likely to be on the order of 15ppb (which is the rock saturated with strong He3).

If that's true then:

\* There are 8,760 hours in a year.

\* There's 1.5 feet for every hour in a distance of 2.56 miles.

\* Get where I'm going with this?

We let the Regolith act like a sponge for weak He3 and we walk a harvester with a charged plate on the bottom to sniff (collect) the weak He3 as it is released from the regolith by vibration.

The thing only has to crawl at 1.5 feet an hour 24/7.

It will harvest 1 ton of He3 per year at that speed.

All we need is for it to be big enough to traverse all the obstacles in its path.

The path should only have to be big enough to traverse a 15 day window (30 miles or so), because at the end of that day it would start to cover its tracks over the Lunar night before retracing its steps in the lunar day.

The way to mine the moon isn't to mine it, it's simply to pass over it.

If the harvester were a mile wide it needs only to walk like an old man across the harvesting field.

We literally already build these kind of mega structures with irrigation crawlers and etc.

It avoids all the problems of mining, no friction, no dust, even.

Lastly, even if the concentrations after a lunar day, of weak He3 were only 1ppb. You simply build 15 harvesters.

15 Harvesters to harvest a ton of He3 per year is far easier than mining 60 MILLION TONS OF ROCK","We can't mine for He3 on the Moon, but we can harvest it!"

If you were to stand in exactly the same spot and look in exactly the same direction at exactly the same time every day, with something thin and upright in front of you, let's say a lamppost, then the sun would always appear to rise (or set depending on the direction you are looking in) on one side of that post right? Well what would have to happen for it to suddenly rise on the other side (so a few inches to the left or right from our perspective)?

I know distance from the sun has nothing to do with it, if the earth moved closer or farther from the sun it would just appear bigger or smaller in the sky, and I don't think a change in orbit would cause this effect. My gut reaction was maybe it has something to do with the angle of axis the earth is on, and maybe if the earth tilted further or straightened up this could cause this effect.

But based off of what I’ve learned and also researched I had an idea while I was half asleep that makes sense in concept. I have no idea if this has already been discussed before and it probably has and I’m just stupid but anyways…

For context I’ll be using the planet Mars, which apparently takes approximately 7 months to travel to. Okay so, if there was someone on Mars at this very point in time, they in concept would be looking at earth 7 months in the past because of the time it takes for light and etc to reach Mars. So in theory there is a plane of time that exists 7 months in the past in this very moment. This can apply to other plants too like for instance on a planet that takes 10 years to get to, if you were on that planet right now you would be looking at earth 10 years in the past because that time has not caught up. Now, if this is the case that there are planes of time that still exist where the past is in theory still the present, is there a scientific possibility through wavelengths or something where travelling to and from a planet in a fraction of a second would result in travelling in the past? 

With this theory though I’ve realised some flaws such as if you were to travel back to a plane of time where you were being born, would that result in you going back to that state of a baby or would there be two of you? 

Anywho, if anyone has any information on this type of stuff let me know

When asked ""Do you believe in Black Holes?"" he answered with ""No. I believe in something that BEHAVES like a Black Hole"".

Now I'm still extremely ignorant on the subject but from what I gather Black Holes are both possible and impossible due to the Singularity (That's how its called right?) inside it. Nothing in the Universe is actually infinite or at least we haven't found anything yet to prove that.

Happy holidays, everyone! On December 24th, NASA's $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is set to launch. If all goes well, this telescope is poised to revolutionise astronomy. I think it's safe to say this is the most highly anticipated event in the subreddit's history. Some of the first posts I remember reading on here were about Webb, and that was around a decade ago. 

To celebrate this historic launch, we've made a **custom banner**, which you can see on reddit PC in 'new reddit' mode. We also have a special **new community award** which costs 1,000 coins :) 

# Megathread plans

People are obviously excited about Webb and the posts about it are only going to ramp up further. However, this is going to be very different to any space telescope launch we've seen before. This is because after launch the telescope has to travel to lagrange point 2, which will take 29 days, furthermore during this journey it is designed to unfurl in more than a hundred carefully planned steps, all of which must go perfectly. The point is this is going to be a **prolonged** nail-biting period. So we'll be setting up megathreads. These megathreads serve two purposes:

1. Act as a single place for people to post and find about the latest updates on the launch and deployment process. 
2. Soak up repetitive posts. Unless you want all discussion on the subreddit for the following month to be drowned out by 'bolt 431 has deployed!' posts, we need a megathread.

So in general, webb posts should be directed to these megathreads when they're set up. The only exception is if there's important breaking news that *no one else has posted about yet*, you'll be allowed to make a dedicated post.

There'll be two megathreads. The first will be on launch day and will cover the period of the rocket launch, and will of course have a bunch of useful links like livestream links. The second will cover the 29 day-long deployment process. If people find that the current number of posts about Webb is already too much, I'll consider making a pre-launch megathread for the final stacking, roll-out of the rocket etc.",Preparing for the launch of James Webb on r/Space ✨

So there's always the issue of the astronauts being weak and stuff because they have to get back used to being on earth with gravity pulling on their bodies. Technically, could they work out enough to keep bone density at acceptable levels and be ok when getting home or no matter what will they lose bone density the longer they are there no matter what? I know they have specific workout stations and all, but could they technically keep their bone density at acceptable levels perpetually if they worked out enough, or would they pretty much have to work out all the time? I was kinda thinking it would make sense that if they constantly did hard enough workouts with the contraptions they have, you could technically keep bone mass at acceptable (albeit lower) levels at all times. 

So they workout for an alotted amount of time each day and have a few weeks/months of recovery time to gain back bone density. This is after 6 months of a fixed workout schedule. If they were to do the same workout schedule for 2 years, would they still have the same recovery time as someone who was doing that for 6 months or would they be weaker? Would they have to increasingly make their workouts harder and harder?

I mean past the point that radio signals degrade to the point that they are indistinguishable from inter stellar radiation/noise etc) or are scientists looking for something else?

space,"In an alternative model for how the Universe came to be, as compared to the ‘textbook’ history of the Universe, a team of astronomers propose that both of these cosmic mysteries could be explained by so-called ‘primordial black holes’.
Nico Cappelluti (University of Miami), Günther Hasinger (ESA Science Director) and Priyamvada Natarajan (Yale University), suggest that black holes existed since the beginning of the Universe ­­and that these primordial black holes could themselves be the as-of-yet unexplained dark matter. The new study is accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.
“Black holes of different sizes are still a mystery. We don’t understand how supermassive black holes could have grown so huge in the relatively short time available since the Universe existed,” explains Günther Hasinger.

without introducing new particles or new physics, we can solve mysteries of modern cosmology from the nature of dark matter itself to the origin of super-massive black holes,” says Nico Cappelluti.
If most of the black holes formed immediately after the Big Bang

The Big Bang is the leading cosmological model explaining how the universe as we know it began roughly 13.8 billion years ago.

"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 1px dotted rgb(0, 0, 0) !important; border-left: 0px; border-image: initial; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none !important; color: rgb(0, 0, 0) !important;""&gt;Big Bang, they could have started merging in the early Universe, forming more and more massive black holes over time. ESA’s future gravitational wave space observatory, LISA, might pick up the signals of those mergers if primordial black holes exist. Small black holes might simply be the primordial black holes that have not merged into larger ones yet.

According to this model, the Universe would be filled with black holes all over. Stars would start to form around these clumps of ‘dark matter’, creating solar systems and galaxies over billions of years. If the first stars indeed formed around primordial black holes, they would exist earlier in the Universe than is expected by the ‘standard’ model.

Primordial black holes, if they do exist, could well be the seeds from which all black holes form, including the one at the center of the Milky Way

The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Earth, and is named for its appearance from Earth. It is a barred spiral galaxy that contains an estimated 100-400 billion stars and has a diameter between 150,000 and 200,000 light-years.

ESA’s Euclid mission, which will probe the dark Universe in greater detail than ever before, could play a role in the quest to identify primordial black holes as dark matter candidates.

The upcoming NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, a cosmic time machine looking back over more than 13 billion years, will further shed light on this mystery.

“If the first stars and galaxies already formed in the so-called ‘dark ages’, Webb should be able to see evidence of them,” adds Günther.",Black hole could be dark matter?

space,"On the one hand, images of the evolution of the universe timeline, place the CMB (light from reionization of the universe) about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This claims the CMB is far away  before the earliest stars and then galaxies. 

On the other hand, the CMB is the general  temperature of the cooling universe, ~2.725° centigrade, after the Big Bang. In other words, CMB is  the temperature of space away from other sources of heat, e.g., maybe halfway between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. This suggests the CMB is much closer than 380,000 years after the Big Bang.

Getting off the moon and maybe returning from mars might be ""easy"" becuase theres little or no atmosphere and the lower mass of the planet makes it so the atmospheric fricction and the gravitational pull of those moons and planets are lower then earth, so its easier to take off from them. 

But if we ever manage to get to those extra solar superearths which are bigger/denser and probobly have a atmosphere at least as dense as earth, it means that the added gravitational pull of those planets will require rockets/catapults/magnetic launchers which will need to be explonentionally larger and will also produce G force variations which will probobly turn any crew on those vessles in to mince meat.

The closest real-world equivalent would be an intelligent plant showing up on earth. If that plant could walk and think for itself. Aliens would be something like that, but neither a plant nor an animal.

Unless the cells we know of are the definite solo building blocks of life. Then aliens would be somewhat like us. If those aliens are the things that brought life to our planet, or they are just from the same origin point in space. Unlikely, but aliens themselves are already unlikely to be found.

If you really hate the idea of aliens you could say this is evidence they don't exist. Not only would life have to evolve to a point of sentience, then evolve to gain intelligence. It would have to create building block cells that can combine into larger organisms.",Something about aliens

space,"The clock is 03:00am here now, and everyone is asleep. I was about to go to bed, and then I saw this super bright star? shining with rainbow colors in the skies. I then knew I had to get my mini telescope and take a closer look before I went to bed. I don't know what I saw, but it looked like something exploding, maybe a supernova or something? And it was so damn shiny, I could really see it clearly in the skies when looking outside the window. But the strange thing is, when I looked in the telescope, the explosions was changing into different rainbow like colors all the time, and the light also changed shapes. I almost looked like a sci-fi thing, like a star war. The shapes of the light looked like a shuriken with a orb inside, and then suddenly it got 3 tails of rainbow colors floating up. It was very interesting, and almost scary at the same time.

I need to get myself a better telescope and a way to video record the events in space where I live. I see some cool stuff going on in the space from where I live, but I don't have a telescope good enough to really get a good look. And I wanna record it for evidence.

## About this Event

Dr Andy Spry worked with Colin Pilinger on the Beagle 2 Mars spacecraft. He was responsible for the lander being built to meet all the rules for ensuring that it did not contaminate Mars with Earthly microbes and that any positive results indicating signs of life on Mars were due solely to martian material.

Following Beagle 2, Andy moved to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, leading planetary protection for a number of NASA robotic missions. He will be speaking from the SETI Institute where he is Senior Scientist and consultant to NASA HQ on planetary protection issues.

The talk will be held in MS Teams and will also be streamed on the day with links provided nearer the time.","Microsoft Teams free event: The 6th Annual Colin Pillinger Memorial Event - Mars, and Other Places we Care About; Planetary Protection in the Commercial Spaceflight Era: a talk by Dr Andy Spry."

*note: I don't have anything against flat earthers and this will be a HUGE thread


Well I want to share my theory's and trying to prove flat earthers that the earth is indeed a globe.
First there are pictures that prove thaf the earth is a globe and I understand that people think it's photoshopped so my argument against this is that Neil Armstrong went to space and saw it in his own eyes. Second argument is that all the other planets are round but then why is the earth flat?

Then we have that people think: ""Wel I feel like I am standing still and not spinning"" and my answer to that is that that's because the earth is large and has a gravitational pull and that keeps us in place while we are spinning around the earths axis 

Another argument of flat earthers is: ""The Artics are a border so we don't fall of"" well it has been proven that the North Pole a seperate and disconnected piece is and that the South Pole also disconnected is from any other piece of land

Then we have people saying: ""well if the earth isn't flat then why do we have floods and they don't just go away"" well that is because the gravitational pull is keeping the water against the globe and stops it from falling of.


Thank you for reading this and if you are a flat earther please comment any questions or things that you do not agree on and again I am only 13 and do not have a scientific degree

That leaves Mars which I'm excited to find and hope for reasonable detail.

space,"Okay, hypothetical time.

You’re on the Moon in a habitat designed for long-term occupancy.  Some emergency happens that causes complete loss of air pressure, but not explosively so; you have no ability to reach a full pressure suit but you *do* have the time to reach a full-face air mask (like firefighters use) connected to a tank with many hours’ worth of air.  You’ve rigged the mask sufficiently tight to prevent air leakage.  You are wearing long, white clothing that will block you from direct sunlight.  It is daytime, and the sun is climbing.  You have hours of sunlight left.

The nature of the catastrophe is such that (won’t bother with details) you cannot salvage a pressure suit elsewhere, nor can you radio for help, nor are there surface vehicles to jump in.

There *is* another habitat on the Moon, if you can reach it on foot.  You can open the airlock from the outside without help from others and enter.

**How far can the habitat be and you still realistically make it on foot before dying either from lack of oxygen due to lack of external air pressure hampering your ability to breathe effectively from the tank, or overheating from sunlight despite your full-coverage white clothing?**

space,"BACKSTORY:  
Hi, many of those posts that had asked this question already are many years old, so I would like to ask this in my way. I am going to be honest, I am 20 and a non-CS major (I major in Chinese Studies, but that's for another story). I got into the world of computer science only and month and a half ago...but it has been crazy and fun. I am learning a lot. I have one more year in university left, and I am planning to fill my coursework with CS classes rather than graduating early, since I only have a couple classes left.  

DILEMA: I am not quite sure where to go after university, I was thinking I could dive deeper into the field by taking a gap year, and take a bachelors in CS in Europe rather than the US to save money. Life is long right? So maybe an end goal could be something with the space industry. But I don't have much idea of how to go about this. I am currently learning Python and I have learned some HTML and CSS. I plan to get into Django and Java soon (because school courses require this).  
QUESTION:  
What pathway should I take? As someone who is basically new at this? If my end goal would be to do something in the space industry, what should I be trying to accomplish/learning about? What languages? Any information would help!

space,"**1)** Do you believe we could be living in a ""protected"" region of space by ""the"" I mean THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe from the lesser advanced predator aliens species ? I mean if we consider that some region of space in the universe are ""older"" and some ""younger"" from others by the activity of space itself (star creation, super novae destruction, black holes etc) it would be reasonable to assume some aliens species are older than some others. We could be living in the middle of a vast intergalactic communications system and can't see it yet..it could be all around us in a different format... in the same way that we couldn't understand / see the cosmic microwave background, or gravitational waves, black holes and things like that a few hundred years ago. Also if we live in that ""protected"" region of space it would explain many things like the lack of any proof of advanced aliens species yet, the silence, nothing detected etc in the same way that we protect animals in a zoo.

**2)** Could it be possible too that ""the"" THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe (like the really top) and the oldest, are being of pure""energy"" no more biological, or robotics or things like that.. if they were in front of us would they be indistinguishable from nature to us because they are so advanced ? (e.g imagine Ancients in Stargate) I mean like, immortal beings who knows mostly everything on how the universe work... billions years old civilizations... it would be pointless for them to hurt us in the same way it's pointless for us to kill a ant ? Could theses beings exist and make the others behave or listen ? by being so advance too... do you believe that they have ""no choice"" in being inherently ""good"" because they can destroy everything / anything in ways we can't imagine ? life creation/protection/expansion would be the most essential thing for them ? If we believe in theses multiverse multidimensions theories, do you think theses being could move from a universe/dimension to another ? or even create universe or galaxy themselves ? If we imagine a long road with water on it, it would be reasonable to assume 1 universe is a water hole and some water hole are connected.

**3)** On a final thought... if we see the universe as a ""finite/infinite region of space"" in term of ""space"" like the space you have in your house, could theses being move inside that region of space in ways that we can't imagine yet ? I mean instead of having a spaceship with fuel and a propulsion system with a engine, like a human would think, could they use the ""darkness"" of space I mean space ""itself"" like scientist like to call the ""aether""... as a way to move or teleport from region to region extremely fast or instantly ? play/move with the aether as a wave or tunnel to travel long distance or do others things ? by being energy beings they wouldn't require a spaceship / suits / or whatever they could ""be"" just there ? I mean existing in a space / dimension in a place without requiring anything but themselves. From a very fundamental point of view I believe we can explain the big things from the small things, and the complex things from the easy things. I also believe that from the ""natural progression"" of life itself on earth in every aspect social technical mental etc, that it's not far fetched that a ""evolution lader "" exist in nature, which is related to time itself... a relationship directly proportional with itself meaning that the more time pass the wiser you are, the more advanced you are, the more conscious and intelligent you are.

space,"Clickbait title aside, has the idea of putting a system of sprinklers on the Moon been discussed before?

Moon dust is nasty stuff, and if any Moon base is to be built at all in the future, dust will certainly need to be addressed sooner rather than later. A good solution would be to have a sprinkler system, either from a grid of sprinklers set up around the proposed base location, or from a mobile vehicle (basically a firetruck rover controlled by A.I.).

space,"NASA announced that an array of planets with similarities to some in our solar system have been found around a nearby star. The star, known as L 98-59, is 35 light-years away from Earth. There may be as many as five planets in orbit around it, including an ocean world, a potentially habitable planet and one of the lightest-ever exoplanets ever discovered.

The problem is that with current technology it would take 37,000-38,000 years to travel even one light year (if my research is correct). Unless we develop faster than light (FTL) propulsion, we will never be able to get to those planets.

Lately, I’ve been quite interested in the space industry and was wondering having knowledge and a degree in general engineering would help advance in this industry.

I’ll be starting my first year in finance (also turning 21 this year) this fall, and was wondering if I should go on to do a MEng (4 years integrated bachelors and masters) in General engineering instead of doing my masters in a finance related subject or an mba. Basically, I would have 2 bachelors and one masters degrees. Do you think it’s worth it?

There also seemed to be some kind of stigma around these type of shows.

People seemed fine with zombies, sword &amp; sorcery, and even costumed superheroes but were apathetic or even downright dismissive of anything with a spaceship in it.

\* \* \*

It has been theorized by some that humans are the only intelligent lifeforms to exist in the universe. It's understandable how some would think that seeing as how we have yet to discover any intelligent lifeforms but personally I disagree with this theory simply due to how vast and infinite the universe is. We know so little about our universe and so i wouldn't seem too out of the question for intelligent life to exist out there somewhere in the cosmos. Surely we can't be alone in the universe. To me, it just seems unlikely that life could only exist here in the vast and infinite ocean of space. Throughout history science has proven itself wrong time and time again.

However, I also imagined myself 20 years down the road, looking back and saying to myself, why didn’t I just go for it? What was there to lose?

After talking to my physics teacher who knows a relatively great amount about this stuff, he put me onto biomedical engineering. Best of both worlds where I could potentially end up as some type of mission specialist or design space suits or something of those works.

This ambition and these ideas are exciting but I know the reality is tough. It’s gonna take a lot of work and dedication and there’s the chance that I might fail. But every night I go outside and I can literally just sit there until my neck is sore because I’m so entranced by the stars and the mystery and the fact that if God made this vast universe why shouldn’t we go explore it and so what if we fail but best of all I feel like a little kid again and I forget all my worries because all this shit is so damn insignificant when you look at the big picture. So yeah I’m going to go for it because why the hell not?

I know that was long and there’s not really a specific question but if you’ve gotten this far I appreciate it. As I’ve said I’d love for any of your thoughts and personal experiences that you guys can share that could help me or enlighten even its just a little. I’ve got a long and uncertain journey ahead and I’m excited though nervous but fuck it I’m all for it.",Future Astronaut?

 **October 14, 2020 -**

*NASA will broadcast coverage of a first for the agency as its Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission attempts to collect a sample of asteroid Bennu on Tuesday, Oct. 20, at 6:12 p.m. EDT.*

*OSIRIS-REx, which is about the size of a 15-passenger van, is currently orbiting the asteroid Bennu 200 million miles from Earth. Bennu contains material from the early solar system and may contain the molecular precursors to life and Earth’s oceans. The asteroid is about as tall as the Empire State Building and could potentially threaten Earth late in the next century, with a 1‐in‐2,700 chance of impacting our planet during one of its close approaches. OSIRIS-REx is now ready to take a sample of this ancient relic of our solar system and bring its stories and secrets home to Earth.* 

WATCH LIVE: [https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive](https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive)","At 18:12 EDT (22:12 GMT), NASA's OSIRIS-REx will land on, sample, and leave asteroid Bennu - and you can watch LIVE!"

I always liked this quote. It helped me reconcile that I could not understand the mathematical gymnastics involved with dark matter, dark energy, string theory or the sudden unexplained expansion at the beginning of the universe.

However, I recently stumbled across the ""GM=tc\^3"" theory by Louise Riofrio that seems way to simple to be true. Does this simple equation really reconcile these anomalies and remove the need for a huge amount of dark “stuff” just to make the math work out.?

As dark matter and dark energy have yet to be found despite years of searching, it may be possible we made a fundamental error in assuming the speed of light has always been the same.

Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin, the first human to explore space took beef and liver paste from a tube, followed by chocolate sauce as dessert in 1961.

Use of food in space expeditions has been a question among all. The generation, that aspires to be astronauts at the beginning of Space Age, would have considered it a daydream after knowing what astronauts actually used to eat during their stay in space. However, astronaut’s foods have improved over recent years whereas a monotonous menu still appears to be a challenge for long-term spaceflight.

After returning to earth, Christina Coch, a female astronaut from NASA, who has spent the longest time in space, got desperate for salsa and chips as she told The Associated Press. According to her, you cannot have crunchy foods on space-suites as those may be hazardous to equipment. 

In 1961, Gagarin’s food was crumb-free and had two-portioned pureed meat preserved carefully in tube-like containers while John Glenn used to have applesauce and sugar tablets, dissolvable in water during his space visit in the following year. Glenn’s meal also featured pureed vegetables and beef in tube which has now been preserved in the National Air and Space Museum. 

During the first era of space expedition, space foods looked more like toothpaste. Throughout the Mercury program, NASA astronauts were allowed to take sucking foods put in tubes whereas freeze-dried bite-sized cubes and powders were available as another option. NASA’s Gemini program allowed astronauts to have solid-ish food and instead of toothpaste-like food, freeze-dried cubes covered in gelatin were served to stop crumbs. Then NASA took an advanced step by putting freeze-dried foods in plastic containers for the convenience of astronauts to carry something palatable such as veggies, chicken or shrimp cocktail.

By NASA’s Apollo mission, things were improved to another level after engineers had brought new developments like “spoon bowl” and hot water. Hot water was convenient for easily reconstituting freeze-dried food whereas spoon bowls made out of plastic bag required to be unzipped for eating food with a spoon. This attempt aimed to create an earthly experience. Freeze-dried foods were commonly used as reducing enough water from food would prevent bacteria from growing and this has also been a popular way of offering food to astronauts during their space expeditions. International Space Station has come up with 200 different items on its menu for astronauts and most of them have been made rehydrated. NASA has also taken an initiative to serve astronauts with warm sandwiches at launch for eating them in orbit. As astronauts spend many months in space at a time, a variety of food is tried to be offered to them to keep away the monotony of taking the same food week after week. As shaking pepper and salt for having them with food is prone to create an airborne hazardous situation, foods are served in liquid form. 

Space stations keep on experimenting to cater to the taste buds of astronauts during their stay in space so that they do not feel it monotonous to have liquidized food for a long time.

space,"Since it’s starting to look more and more like Starship might actually be happening, I did a bit of checking.  SpaceX hopes that they can get the launch costs down as low as 2 million dollars.  I found numbers on the internet that estimate an unmanned (payload only) Starship could launch about 150 tons into space.  Even if we say these are wildly optimistic and cut them back (10 million per launch, only 100 tons into space), this will still be extremely disruptive.

There are tons of ways this could change the space industry, but one notion I quite like is that nearly every developed country could have it’s own space station.  I’m not saying that they should, but let’s consider it.  Canada is a country with a smallish space program, a budget of around 300 million per year.  It wouldn’t be that hard for them to design a rough tin-can space station (designed to fill a Starship’s payload bay, so it would have decent space).  Spend the first year designing and building it.  Second year’s budget goes to buying an entire Starship launch (as opposed to sharing one, which I think would become a common occurrence).  Third year’s budget goes to putting human crew on a manned Starship to visit and perform missions on the space station.   SpaceX does all the heavy lifting (literally) for getting your gizmos and people up into space.  Which frees up the countries to just make sure they're outpost doesn't leak and is safely self-sustaining.

If we assume that the 2 million dollar launch cost is true, even more humble space programs could pull it off.  The Australian Space Agency’s yearly budget is only 10 million dollars.  It would take them more time to finish building the station, but it would be relatively easy to put aside 2 million to launch it.  I think most countries could put aside 2 million for the prestige of having their own outpost in space.",Every country could have a space station (Starship speculation)

[Rotating space station ring \(purple\) with stationary central hub \(white\). White bubbles are place holders for modules without gravity. ](https://preview.redd.it/uhwvaodq9k961.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=332a066641b11007532764b916414926a43d3f90)

Since this topic has often been popping up lately, I decided to turn my old study paper into this reddit post.  

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jjicip2cjfxgvy9/Reddit-runner%20Paper_Rotating%20Space%20Station.pdf?dl=0) is the PDF. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **Tl:dr PDF. Here is a quick summary:** 

  

There are two main reasons why most people want to go to space and especially to low earth orbit:

* Experiencing weightlessness (for science or recreation)
* Observing earth (for science or admiration)

In both cases, some kind of space station is needed if people want to stay for longer than a few hours/days. The dilemma is that one of the reasons to go there (weightlessness) is also the source of many problems. For example detrimental effects on the body and difficulties with handling fluids in any aspect like washing or cooking.

**The often-proposed solution is artificial gravity by rotation.** 

Many proposed solutions involve a monolithic rotating structure. In order to omit the challenge of an airtight connection between the rotating part and the stationary part, the stationary part is omitted entirely. Unfortunately, this leaves only two possibilities for docking ports in the axis of rotation. Furthermore, *without the stationary part tourists and experiments cannot be exposed to a micro-g environment or watch earth properly, which negates BOTH main reasons why one flies into Low Earth Orbit in the first place.* 

This dictates that there has to be a stationary part where weightlessness can be experienced and the earth be observed and a rotating part for living quarters.  So far all proposals I know off include some kind of seal at the transition between stationary part and rotating part. But there are no seals that would allow a maintenance free operation. (Why aren't there such seals? Read the PDF!)

My  solution is having no airtight connection and no direct passage between the rotating and stationary parts of the station. Instead the transition is done via gondolas. A still standing gondola can dock to the stationary part and be accessed by an airtight docking connection, then it decouples, spins up and docks to the rotating part. The required lateral movement range is minimal and is only determined by the necessary clearance of the docking mechanisms. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Rotating Space Station](https://preview.redd.it/y6wm9uzvck961.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561da95ef8128b2158550e6ddc728a842f77025f)

A set of two gondolas (orange) rotates on rails (green) around the central hub (brown). The access tubes (dark brown) extend side ward from the central hub. The elevator tubes (yellow) provide a passage from the rotating ring (purple) to the gondolas.

There can be one set of gondolas on each side of the spokes.

The central hub contains a passageway between both stationary parts of the station.

&amp;#x200B;

The two pairs of gondolas sit on a similar or even same type of magnetic bearings as the spokes do. While stationary, the pair of Gondolas can slide to the side and connect to the docking points at the Access Tunnel. When spinning up and matching the angular speed of the elevator tubes the gondolas can move and connect to the docking points on the tubes.

The pairs of gondolas can be used independently and can act as backup for each other.

This is actually my first post - so I apologize in advance if this isn't an appropriate question.

I'm looking for a video/documentary about the creation of the Universe that I believe I saw on YouTube several years ago (2018ish) and I'm hoping someone here might be able to help. 

The video described the origin of the Universe in a way that really made sense. Along with the narrator's explanation, there was a visualization of entropy (basically one color on top half of the video, one color on the bottom) and then an explanation of why the entropy was disturbed (because of the inherent instability of ""nothing"" happening). The video then went on to animate the entropy being disturbed...  it was decidedly not the typical animation of an ""explosion"" of stars and galaxies representing the ""Big Bang"" - for my money is was much more nuanced. It was great.

Is this ringing any bells for anyone? Sadly I can't remember anything else definitive. I believe that I was looking into thoughts about ""why"" the Universe began at the time.",Video explanation of entropy during the beginning of the Universe?

space,"This is a question I've had for awhile. I have always wondered why we wouldn't just make a base on one of mars moons before tackling the red planet itself. 

There's a couple of reasons for my idea. Phobos orbits mars about every 7 and a half hours, and has next to no atmosphere which would make it a viable solar power option. Radiation would be a larger problem than before, but we could send a base lined in copper and lead, then bury it. We might even be able to harvest some co2 from mars atmosphere to freeze and cover our base. It may even be easier to land on the moon. We could use deimos to slow our desent and rocket engines to help with landing, sort of like Apollo 13.  Water is a problem, but we could use a water recycler for that. It's even a possibility we could catch passing astroids and use them to replenish our supplies

Oxygen is a problem which could be solved by smelting aluminum and plants. We could even use the same sort of ""air recycler"" they have on the ISS. Aquaponics for food. Low gravity could be solved with rotating habitats.

space,"Hi there.

First of all, I'm no scientist, and for that, I apologize in advance if I get anything wrong or if this sounds absurd. So a friend and I watched some videos from Kurzgesagt. Two were about the Fermi Paradox and one was about the Great Filter. I want to note that Kurzgesagt simplifies a lot in their videos, but do list important sources in video descriptions. Still, we got intrigued by the Fermi Paradox and began discussing it. We both had a bunch of solutions to it: some infeasible while others were plausible. I have always assumed that life would be present in the universe; it's just impossible for us to be the only one out there in such a vast universe. But my friend had very... unusual answers. He said it would be very rare for life to suddenly exist out of dead particles. He even considered it to a miracle that we're even alive. He also said that perhaps there is life out there, but it might've never evolved into such an advanced species like us. He compared it to apes on Earth: they aren't evolving because they're perfectly fine. They don't have the pressure to make drastic changes to increase their survivability. But then came his weirdest idea yet: he said there might be life out there that died of infertility. I argued that the problem of infertility could be combated by cloning, but he proposed that their genetic code might never work the same as ours. We have DNA and perhaps they have something entirely different. Could infertility really be the cause of no life in the universe? Because I'm just having a hard time believing that.

TL;DR: My friend argues that infertility may be the cause of no life in the universe. Is this really plausible?",Fermi Paradox - Is it possible that infertility may be the cause of no life in the universe?

HFOU- number of **h**ot **f**emales in the **o**bservable **u**niverse  
HFE - number of **h**ot **f**emales on **e**arth  
EOP - overall earth population  
PFOP - percentage number of females in overall population  
PHASOP - percentage of hottest age span in overall population  
HPPHPLC - number of habitable planets with potential hot people-like creatures on them  


**Facts:**

A) There are around 150 billions (by billion I mean 10^(9)) ""average-sized"" galaxies in our observable universe. I assumed on average they have like 50% the number of stars of our milky way, so around 100 billions. 

B) There are around 3000 billions dwarf galaxies in this very same universe. Each of them may have around 100 milion stars.

C) Last I checked Pluto was considered not to be a planet of a solar system so we have 8 planets in our solar system. This means that on average each of stars in the universe may have around 8 planets orbiting them. For stars within dwarf galaxies I'll reduce the number to 4.

D) Out of these 8 planets within our solar system only one of them has intelligent, human-like life exists (unless deep under the ice of Europa's moon something alive exists. But even if that's the case, I doubt it would be in a human-like form, let alone hot form) and is capable of producing hot females (or males, but I'm not that interested in hot males so I'll focus on counting females in this example of a principle in use). Therefore I estimate each star in the universe has 8 planets orbiting it and one of them is capable of producing human-like species (1/8 chance).

E) The number of hot females on earth based on my preference hovers around 2-10% or 1/50 to 1/10 (withing the overall population). To simply the matter, I'll use 5% or 1/20 as an example. This number will remain constant throughout universe.

Ok so let's actually jump to the maths now:

**1) This is the estimated number of hot females on earth.**

So as I said, there are nearly 8 bilion people as of now. Around 50% of them are female. Then, around 30% of them are within age 18-35 (the hottest age span, I'd say) Based on estimation of my preferance there's a chance I'd find 5% of them hot. So:

HFE = ((EOP \*PFOP) \* PHASOP) \* PNRST =  ((8 billion \*50%) \* 30%) \* 5% = 60 millions

HFE = 60 millions

This number will be the number of hot females on each of the habitable planets in the universe.

**2) The total number of stars in all average-sized galaxies:**

ASAASG = AASG \* ASOASG = 150 billions \* 100 billions = 15 000 000 000 000 000 000 000

ASAASG = 15 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 = 15 sextillions

**3) The total number of stars in all dwarf galaxies**

ASADG = ADG \* ASODG = 3000 billions \* 100 millions = 300 000 000 000 000 000 000

ASADG = 300 quintillions

**4) Number of all planets orbiting their stars in the observable universe**

APOSOU = ASOU \* APOSS = (15 sextillions \* 8) + (300 quintillions \* 4) = 121 200 000 000 000 000 000 000

APOSOU = 121,2 sextillions

**6) Chance for a human-like, hot female in the average solar system**

CHLHFASS = 1/8 = 12.5% (based on the solar system)

**7) Number of habitable planets with potential hot people-like creatures on them**

HPPHPLC = APOSOU \* CHLHFASS = 121,2 sextillions \* 1/8 = 15,15 sextillions

**8) Number of hot females in the observable universe**

HFOU = HPPHPLC \* HFE = 15,15 sextillions \* 60 millions = 909 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000

**HFOU = 909 octillions**

So there are around 909 octillions, in other words 909 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 of potential hot female aliens roaming the universe. This is **113 625 000 000 000 000 000 times more** than the overall number of **all** people living on earth as of now.

**COOL.**

However I do strongly believe they looked upon its short lived and yet highly awe grabbing life as inspiration to go further and achieve more towards there own personal goals of commercial space flight and science outside of the Karma Line. This is also why I believe they intentionally transplanted to the U.S in Operation Paper Clip, and begin working for them.

From there he went on to develop ICBM's for the Americas (something I also believe would have irritated him).

Is it possible for us to ""rewind"" the star chart and see the position of the starts 17,600-ish years ago and look to see if the signal's originating point more closely align with a star system in that area?

space,"The concept of vacuum was known to me before I got my current job. However, now that I work with vacuum in distillation, my understanding got somewhat broadened.

The first concept I got familiar with, was the fact that vacuum is the same as pressure that is lower than what we're used to within our atmosphere. The amount of pressure around us is 1,013 millibars or roughly 1 bar. The small particles that fill up our air, atmosphere and lungs as we're breathing, are what creates this pressure. As soon as particles are removed from an area, there's a vacuum. Sometimes you'll feel that when you're quickly trying to pull a door open in a room that's otherwise closed up, or when you're trying to pull in air with something as a plastic bag close to your mouth. The vacuum is merely the pull of particles.

What's interesting is that an unbalance in pressure will immediately get filled if possible. Particles are trying to even out the area to which they are confined, making an even pressure overall. This is what makes working with vacuum in distillation a true nightmare, I promise you that. The smallest of gaps may ruin your production.

Now, sometimes we like to wonder about the universe and its limitlessness. We might ponder what's at the edge of the universe, is there a big frame around the world, and what would be outside that frame? 

To me, I suppose there's just vacuum. If there was no pull, the Big Bang might never have happened. It makes sense to me that the singularity would have stayed a singularity if there wasn't anything pulling from the outside. Perhaps this unbalance in pressure that has been going on for 13.8 billion years is the reason it's all able to keep going. 

In any case, vacuum is a force to be reckoned with. We have had containers of stainless steel able to hold more than 20.000 gallons of liquid being squashed and sucked shrunk due to an unexpected vacuum inside of them.",Understanding vacuum: my take

space,"""Cozy"" isn't precisely the right word but it's the most appropriate one I can think of - I feel like many of you will know the feeling I'm trying to pinpoint, so it's on the right track, at least.

Space is cold and vast and inhospitable - but something about it is at the same time instinctively inviting.

Star Trek, for example - something about the spacefaring setting is inherently relaxing -  now maybe this is just my own nostalgic associations (it's a 'comfort show') but I find this same kind of feeling linked with the setting of space itself in various forms of media.

*Alien* is movie about all about tension and being uncomfortable yet somehow the space outside the ship still exists as this comforting backdrop. Maybe it's the mechanic whirring and buzzing of the ship as it trudges through this unimaginable vastness - the very peacefulness of the space surrounding allows this tension and anxiety to build?

I often fantasize about being an explorer with a spaceship - the freedom to travel huge distances and the feeling of being this small and insignificant thing compared to my ship, which itself is insignificant compared to the crater on a moon, which is itself insignificant compared to the moon itself, which is insignificant when.. well, you get the idea.

And one line stood out to me:

&gt;The launch window opens at 7:50am EDT (11:50 UTC), with launch opportunities available at five-minute intervals.

This is the launch window for the Perseverance rover to Mars. I know orbits line up and this is the only chance to launch while the two planets are lined up, otherwise we have to wait. But what I don't get is why the 5 minute intervals?

I see no reason for the launch window to open/close constantly every 5 minutes? There are ideal times to launch based on the target and the current position of both objects, but I fail to see how a launch window can be 5 okay -&gt; 5 no go -&gt; 5 ok -&gt; 5 no go

space,"So, I have a co-worker, who happens to be a new-earth creationist (earth/universe is ~6000 years old). He and I, during downtime sometimes discuss matters like science, philosophy, religion and whatnot. Sometimes his religious beliefs come into play, other times not. Except for the obvious, he’s actually quite intelligent and provides good insight into a number of things.

We were talking about the comet earlier and he says to me, “You know, comets are proof of a young earth.” Rather than contradict him immediately, I asked him to explain why that is. He basically goes on to say that comets lose mass when they get close to the sun, with some even breaking up and ceasing to exist. If the Earth/Solar System/Universe were billions of year old, these comets would likely not exist anymore. Of course I’d heard this argument before and mentioned the Oort Cloud, and how that would continually provide comets or “refresh” existing comets.

I’ll admit, I only had cursory knowledge of the Oort Cloud, and so had no idea how to rebut his next statement. He said, “We have no observational evidence of the Oort Cloud. The only evidence there could be is simply it has to exist for comets to still exist in an old solar system. Young solar system has no need of the Oort Cloud and is supported by the existence of comets.”

I conceded that comets were evidence (not proof like he originally said) of a young solar system, but that it didn’t mean the Oort Cloud doesn’t exist. Afterwards, I did some searching and discovered he was basically correct. That there’s no observational evidence of the Oort Cloud, and that it’s existence is essentially required for comets to exist. 

This leads me to my question. Besides what’s been mentioned, do we have any evidence of the Oort Cloud? I could use the fact that some comets have periods that are several times longer than 6000 years to show that comets don’t support young solar system, and likely will next time I see him. But I think I already know what his rebuttal on that would be on that one. So anything more on the Oort Cloud would be helpful.",Oort Cloud Evidence

Teams are invited to create novel and game-changing food technologies or systems that require minimal inputs and maximize safe, nutritious, and palatable food outputs for long-duration space missions, and which have potential to benefit people on Earth.

The Deep Space Food Challenge will identify food production technologies that can:

\*Help fill food gaps for a three-year round-trip mission with no resupply   
\*Feed a crew of four (4) astronauts  
\*Improve the accessibility of food on Earth, in particular, via production directly in urban centers and in remote and harsh environments  
\*Achieve the greatest amount of food output with minimal inputs and minimal waste  
\*Create a variety of palatable, nutritious, and safe foods that requires little processing time for crew members

This Challenge seeks to incentivize teams to develop novel technologies and/or systems for food production that need not meet the full nutritional requirements of future crews, but can contribute significantly to and be integrated into a comprehensive food system","New competition from NASA and CSA, Deep Space Food Challenge"

I also got ""Kerbal Space Program"" and ""Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager"" for my PC.

I became completely enamored by real spaceflight and space exploration.

It was very dark in the station and with some red lights, probably emergency lights, so I decided to go to the other part of the station to see if I could find a way to turn on the lights since the station was powered by sunlight, and arriving there I found one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen in my dreams, it was all dark with only a yellow light coming from a monitor (one of those old alien style ones with yellow writings) and there was a huge corridor that we couldn't see the end of and that disturbing sound the station made, the station was not broken as Sevastopol in Alien but it was empty, just empty, but in that darkness I heard the sound of something walking. .. After that I don't remember my dream anymore but basically what I want to get at is, are there abandoned space stations around the earth? Or loose in space? And if so do you have any pictures or videos? I think it would be really cool, like those videos of astronauts filming the earth from the station, but instead of that going into an abandoned station and filming what the situation is like inside.

Also, assuming the rotation of the ship is stationary, how fast will the ship be rotating around the roll axis (°/s) after, say, 10s of continuous firing.

space,"I am having some trouble wrapping my brain around something. I will try to make the question short. Given the premises that:

1. There is no “real” reference frame, and all reference frames are equally valid

And 

2. To a photon, the universe is only in 2 dimensions due to length contraction along its travel, putting every destination ahead of it 0 distance away

And 

3. Black holes are point masses, where the bonds holding energy and giving it volume have broken down

Then, why does the whole universe not contract and become a black hole? We’ve said that the reference frame of a photon is equally as valid as our own reference frame. We see matter collapse into a black hole when gravity becomes too strong. To any massless particle, the universe should be just a point mass (Assumption mine)?? Since it is contracted to nothing? My brain wants to assume that our reference frame is therefore more valid or “real”, since otherwise it would seem like we are occupying a point mass at the center of a black hole from any massless reference frame...

space,"PREMISE

Artemis II is scheduled for August 2023 and the launch of the one-piece Gateway (PPE + HALO) is scheduled for November 2023. The Dragon XL should already be available by that date as can be seen from page 8 of the linked NASA document ( concerning the docking possibilities of the Artemis II mission).

https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/20200513-nac-heoc-aes-v3.pdf

This document states that during Artemis II docking with Dragon XL is possible while with the Gateway in High Earth Orbit (HEO) there are few time margins, however, there are no times for a lunar orbit encounter (NHRO). This is due to the fact that the Gateway's arrival in NHRO is scheduled for August 2024 after a journey of approximately 9 months.

Considering that a few days ago SpaceX won the selection for the NSSL Phase 2, the launch of the already integrated PPE and HALO becomes feasible.

Launch targeted for November '23, spiral out to NRHO via PPE SEP and chem ~ 270 days
(page 3, https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/gateway_nac_charts_v6.pdf)


PROPOSAL

Lighten the mass of the Gateway to be launched by transferring part of the equipment and cargo of HALO or PPE propellant (the possibility of refueling is already foreseen) into the Dragon XL (which can deliver 5 tons of goods). This increases the maximum height at which the Gateway is placed in orbit from the FH, and consequently reduces the transfer time.

The proposed goal is to transform Artemis II into a long-lasting mission (for example 2 months in the Gateway and 2 weeks in Orion) through the involvement of Orion, Gateway and Dragon XL in lunar orbit. This would have great benefits, not only do you test the docking, but you can also check three of the four pieces needed for moon missions and you can do a lot of science. In addition, the Gateway can provide a higher level of security in case of Orion difficulties.


QUESTIONS

Do you think it is feasible?

Would it be possible to anticipate the launch of the Gateway?

As construction of HALO has already begun, furthermore, the preliminary design review (PDR) of the module project is scheduled for October 2020. It will be followed at the turn of 2020/2021 by a multi-element Critical Design Review (CDR) and in June 2021 by a systemic review of the CDR.

You might say that anyone who wants to gamble their cash has the right to do so, and will learn a vital lesson for their mistakes. But I say that we cannot ignore the signs, scams have happened for this industry before and we can see how they can form again. In an industry filled with hopefully dreamers, we should look out for those who are nieve and over-taken by inspiration.

Still, we cannot verify that this company is a scam, we cannot debunk if they themselves are hopeless romantics. We cannot justify calling them thieves and opportunists. We cannot verify that they are not diligently at work trying to prove their critics wrong.

By placing an investment on the Netcapital platform and through the Gateway Foundation website, you choose to give them a chance. For those of you who invested on Netcapital, you have until April 1st to withdraw your investment. If this company shows no signs of progress by then what can you assume?

space," This coming decade looks to be the biggest one yet for space exploration. People like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Peter Beck are changing the aerospace industry. Commercial Space is ascending as we expand out into space. It's time to get the public engaged and enthused about what lays ahead for space exploration. It's time to gather the space optimists as we venture further out into the heavens. 

 

How do we get the public on board for this journey to our space future?

Start with the youth. There are no bigger space optimists than kids. Blue Origin has created the 'Club For The Future'. It's a good start, but how can it grow exponentially? I think Blue Origin should partner with Legoland in San Diego and build a new section of the amusement park. Perhaps 'Space For The Future'? With O'Neill Wheel half structures and a Lunar Lava Tube ride? A life size New Glenn rocket made out of giant Legos? The Club For The Future would grow enormously. Grab these kids when they are young, make them space fans, and never let them go!

As our young kids get older, how do we keep them engaged in space?

 

Sports. I think Jeff Bezos should buy the Chargers and move the team back to San Diego. Blue skies, blue ocean, 'Blue Origin Stadium'. A Super Bowl location where he can promote space travel. Perhaps build 'Blue Origin Space Center' adjoining the stadium, where he can sell rides to space.

Currently it looks like the cost for a ride to space will be about a quarter of a million dollars. Too expensive for most people. But what if every NFL ticket stub was also a raffle ticket for a ride to space? What if every person who could afford an NFL ticket, could also have a chance to travel into space? The popularity of space travel would grow enormously. It would put space travel in the ether.

 

eff Bezos could also send a giant bag of deflated footballs into space. Then retrieve the air from the life support system aboard the New Sheppard capsule, to fill them for the inaugural Super Bowl at Blue Origin Stadium in San Diego.

San Diego is the origin of human rated orbital rockets. The Atlas 6 that carried John Glenn to orbit, was designed and built by Convair &amp; General Dynamics in San Diego in the early 60's. Jeff Bezos is enshrined in the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. The city is the perfect location to promote space exploration, with Sea World, San Diego Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Petco Park(Padres) and yes, Legoland!

 

San Diego also offers Mr. Bezos an opportunity to expand into other sports. Across from Blue Origin Stadium, he could build Amazon Arena for an NBA &amp; NHL franchise? More visitors for the Blue Origin Space Center.

If we want to venture out into space, we must have the public's support and enthusiasm for this grand adventure. We need to market the future of space to our youth and adults. Now is the time to go big.

Make it so!",Jeff Bezos Should Expand His Promotion Of Space &amp; Space Travel

space,"It could be closer than we think. No, not to Mars or the moon, but to Rotating Habitats in space. We have many of the technologies to build these cylindrical megastructures, that perfectly replicate Earth’s gravity and atmosphere, but they’re a challenge of scale. The construction materials can’t be rocketed from the ground, but sourced in space, instead.

Mining asteroids, and the moon, will provide the enough matter for the initial space-bound infrastructure, including a tiny rotating habitat (about the size of a stadium) capable of comfortably housing a few thousand people in space, permanently.

With some infrastructure in place we can start growing our footprint in space. Mercury is specially attractive because, not only it’s 70% metals and 30% silicates, it’s the left over rocky core of a past planetary collision—we won’t need to dig deep to reach the ore we need.

Mining Mercury will allow us to build the first county size rotating habitats, capable of housing millions. In space, solar panels capture over seven times more power than on Earth, making each of these colonies self sufficient.

Finally, as we begin to exhaust Mercury, we can mine the Sun. Our star is metal rich, containing thousands of time the mass of Earth in metals and other materials necessary to continue building rotating habitats. We also know these elements are not sunk down to the core but swirling around, carried by the Sun’s convective process.

We can fit more people in these [megastructures around the Sun](https://erasmixbooks.blogspot.com/) than on all the habitable planets that supposedly exist in the Milky Way.

We’re an incredible species capable of incredible things, especially when we set aside our differences, when we can actually agree to disagree. 

But for all our amazing progress, we still have an incredible amount of pettiness; feels like we’re slowly crawling back into some primordial soup sometimes. There’s zero room for that if we want to survive and evolve as a species. 

(And I do mean evolve; I feel like we sometimes think as evolution contained to the soil below our feet, known as planet Earth. But I think our next evolutionary step will be living on other worlds)

What’s crazy is that this isn’t so much science fiction anymore; right now, if we wanted, we could actively go to the Moon and begin to find out what it would take to live there.

I do believe that in my lifetime, we will have begun to at least colonize Mars let alone having already been on the Moon for years by that point.

We need to work together to not only make this world the best that we possibly can, but together we can stretch to the other heavenly bodies floating around out there.

\*\*\*

Anything spatial, and space itself, never extend beyond our current present. The reason we don’t see it is that we mentally separate space from time. Here’s how.

At first sight, to situate space in the present seems indeed completely incongruous to us because we have mentally made space this timeless frame, this Kantian a priori form. In this perspective, the present belongs to a complete other line of reasoning, the one of time, and is thus reduced to a mere limit between a past and a future.

We might say: yes, space is present, but then any present throughout time is concerned, and so we are back to square one: space as a frame, and present as a temporal limit. However, assuming that a *current* present does exist might be the correct first step in our reasoning. It should not be a problem since everybody readily assumes that the moment they’re living is the current one. And after all, the universe itself has a current age. In fact, the very idea of a present *implies* an actuality: if there is no current present, there is no present (and actually there is no time at all).

But these are just assumptions and we still don’t know which present is the current one. This is what has tried to figure out some philosophical doctrine called *presentism*. “How do we know now is now” asked one of those philosophers \[1\]. “When am I?” asked another one.\[2\] A third one, John McTaggart had previously created a whole system around this question\[3\], and looked for actuality all his life, unfortunately failing to prove it.

But for now, let’s forget about proving actuality, and let’s move on by having a useful reflection on the word *present.* We know that it has two meanings. The first is temporal: the present moment. The second is spatial: that which is not absent, which occupies space, which takes place.

This homonymy should have intrigued greatly (and also the word *actuality* which has the exact same double meaning), but instead, it’s been completely overlooked. Why? Always for the same reason: we have two separate categories in mind. When we talk about the present, we talk about time, not space. Our mind is set up so that space and duration are two different states of affairs.

This Kantian geography of space and time (the famous “a priori forms of our representations”) seems to be our impassable horizon, even after a century of space-time, which is not surprising because space-time (as a sort of phenomenology of the universe) is in fact based on this fundamental separation rather than canceling it out (and in the end, the two cohabit perfectly).

Yet the problem of this mental cleavage of space and time, which seems so natural to us, is that it makes the present this unsituatable, ungraspable, theoretical limit. Is this what all the present is?

So, let’s take our eyes off the Kantian maps, and indeed focus on the two meanings of the word present, and then examine this idea that we want to introduce, that space could in fact lie within the perfect frontiers of a current present.

To help us in this endeavor, let’s return to a concrete, pre-Kantian understanding of space, the one of Descartes and Leibniz. Descartes denied the existence of space prior to that which occupies its own space.\[4\] Following on from Descartes, Leibniz similarly deduced the space of the notion of place, i.e. the place necessarily occupied by a given thing: “space is what results from places taken together.”\[5\]  Even Spinoza maintained this understanding of space, albeit while imbuing it with considerable divine value. Note that this logically implies the rejection of the idea of the void: in other words, as Alexandre Koyré writes, “if God should destroy the world, there would be no void space left behind.""\[6\]

Therefore, let’s consider for the moment the space occupied and nothing more, not as a container, but as a sort of result of that which “takes place.” Of that which is present.

Bearing this *induced* space in mind, let’s turn to a question that may appear strange, but whose response may provide us with some answers as to why the word “present” has two meanings. The question is: does this necessarily occupied space have a place in time?

The response is inevitably surprising, given that, as we have seen, it is masked by the framework of our thoughts, which spontaneously separates the concepts of space and time. It is that space occupies wholly and uniquely the present, i.e. the current one (if it exists, but if it doesn't, there is no time, nor space...)

Indeed, does space extend beyond the present? Does it not perfectly match its extent? Here’s a simple method to convince yourself: please take any object around you: does it extend beyond the present? Then take yourself, do you extend beyond? And lastly move from the particular to the general, which is space: does it extend beyond the present?

Therefore we can no longer think of space, whether geometrical or physical, as a frame: it is, on the contrary, current, “in situation”, matching and accompanying perfectly the present.                               It’s all about actuality. If there is actuality, if 2020 is not happening in the same time as 1880 or -10 000, if the universe is not, in the same time, 1 week old and 13 billion years old, then space is matching the actual present.

Space is presence and actuality in the two meanings of the terms. Anything spatial, any *form* is present in the two meanings of the term and never extends into its past or its future. The present is what encloses a form, so to speak. And conversely, time necessarily involves forms. To achieve this result, we had to deconstruct the mental habit of intuitively seeing the present as a simple limit and space as a dissociated frame. Still, not more than John McTaggart have we *proved* actuality, but if there is one, that’s where space is.

space,"I saw a few comments in r/321 telling tourist not to come to the space coast for DM-2 because they are going to infect the locals.

 I have some advice on how to do that safely. Bring a kayak or a paddle board, you can get one for around $100. There's hundreds of places around the space coast to launch kayaks. I'm not sure which ones will be open, but Kelly Park, 528, haulover canal (probably closed for launch) and North Indian River lagoon are great spots to watch the launch.

Otherwise just stay in your car and find any of the dozens of parks for watching launches. While you're in town grab some carryout food from a local restaurant, they could use the business.

Don't be afraid to visit, just make sure you have plenty of snacks, gas, and water. It takes about 4 hours to leave after the launch.",DM-2 Space Coast Visitors

Apparently, there are tons of space toolkits out there. For starters, ""Stellarium"" is a great Open Source planetarium software (I guess a lot of know you that). There is also NASA Horizons System: An online tool with a REST API that allows one to compute miscellaneous geometric parameters, like state vectors, orbital elements, sky coordinates, etc. Or [meteorshowers.org](https://meteorshowers.org) that shows amazingly the dust streams crossing our planet. There are also hidden / unknown data source and database for the advanced amateurs and much more.

Now, recently I started with a Python meets Space tutorial series on YouTube. And since coding is not everyone's favourite I would like to extend my tutorial idea by introducing and explaining miscellaneous known and also unknown tools that are used in space science and astronomy. Some have a strong focus on the science community and others are maybe nice to simply visualize things. Further, there are databases out there that could be mined and analysed with e.g., ML in awesome ways, if more people (for example free-time scientists) would know that.

Know I want to gather and create a compilation here with a list of tools, online APIs, databases etc. that you think shall be ""commonly known"".

Dr. Brad Tucker, an astronomer and cosmologist at the Australian National University, said the UAE is preparing a “tricky” expedition to Venus that will land on an asteroid. According to Dr. Tucker, if the UAE succeeds in landing on an asteroid, it will join Australia, Japan, and the United States as the fourth countries to do so. “In order to achieve this, they would go into the solar system, fly by Venus and collect photographs and data, then slingshot it back out using Venus’ gravity,” he told Sky News Australia.

This maneuver, according to Dr. Tucker, would give the rocket a lot of speed, which would be further increased by a second slingshot over Earth before flying to the asteroid to collect samples. “This is the real game,” he continued, “landing on these places to take samples and hopefully return them to Earth.” “It’s no longer enough to just go visit or take pictures; we want to collect material from there and bring it back to Earth so we can undertake a much more detailed research.”

space,"I love liquid hydrogen. The energy you can get with it is amazing and it’s actually what enables ULA’s rockets to push heavier payloads farther than SpaceX’s [1], and although I know the US likes to take pride in “having tamed liquid hydrogen” [2], it’s still a pain in the ass and while putting up with a low boiling point, giant, insulated tanks, and complex plumbing can be worth it for upper stages (where efficiency is more valued than thrust), I can’t really see why you’d use it in first stages. Some examples: 

- ULA’s Delta IV family (x1/x3 RS-68 engines)
- ESA’s Ariane 5 (x1 Vulcain)
- NASA’s Space Shuttle (x3 RS-25 engine)
- Blue Origin’s New Shepard (x1 BE-3)
- JAXA’s H-II (x1 LE-7)
- CNSA’s Long March 5 (x2 YF-77)

I understand why the Shuttle used liquid hydrogen, as the RS-25s started at SL but climbed all the way to space, but I’ve been doing some research and I still don’t know why these other rockets use hydrolox (and it’s not for simplicity because even the ones that also use LH2 in upper stages use a different engine).

space,"Yeah, we get it, Russia, like a bunch of other nations, including US and India, has conducted an ASAT test. Here's why it's actually not such a big deal and why you should start using more of your brain capacity before you post some sensationalist newsarticle probably written by a dude that failed grade 11 science  classes. 

So, here are they the main themes and what is exactly going around:

1. Russia conducted an ASAT test.
2. It created debris
3. ISS took evasive Manouvers
4. MY GOD KESSLER!!
5. What can be done about it
6. Political bullshit that has no relation to reality and is straight up insulting
7. Why exactly we have ASAT on this planet.

1. \*Insert Hades meme\* WE GET IT. Seriously, first and foremost this is a piece of news just because Russia has done it. Many nations have conducted similar tests in the past years and you don't see the same ammount of bullshittery spread around like now. 

2. Yes it did. Like all the other countries did when they did their tests. But here's the catch. Space is not a peaceful place where you can meditade about stuff. It's a bloody inhospitable volume where you can end your life in a second. It's full of debris itself already. We generally call them meteors or asteroids. One more sat blown to pieces is barely going to account for anything right now (remember this phrase)

3. Read the previous paragraph again. Space  is full of debris, so ISS takes evasive manouvers all the time. Whether the test was announced via internet, telephone or a billboard in Siberia or nowhere at all, it would have made no difference because you cannot calculate the exact spread of debris beforehand, so you need to start  taking manouvers after you know how many pieces have formed and where they are heading.

4. Kessler syndrome can be a real problem, for  sure. But it doesn't mean the end of all. And we don't have to worry about it in this case. First of  all, one has to understand how orbits work. An orbit is a place where an object (called satellite or orbiter) has very tiny variations in its potential energy (microdrag, gravitational variations, heating from the sun etc.) relative  to the central body of mass, thanks to a big kinetic energy. When you start modifying the energy balance (like  in a collision), the orbit is disturbed and in 99% (just to appease everyone) of cases, for sure it's not going  to enter a new circular orbit. Some might gain escape velocity, but most of the debris is going to enter in eliptical orbits, passing closer to Earth, experiencing increasing microdrag further reducing it's energy and finally, it's going to fall back on Earth. So, most stuff that's getting shot down or suffers a collision is going to be de orbited. The question is: will it generate  more collisions and debris or not? Well, just as said above, space is already filled with debris, so why aren't we experiencing this syndrome now? Well, because SPACE  IS HUGE. Even LEO volume is huge. At the current number of sats in orbit, the chances of collision +countermeasures basically make the  danger negligeable for now. HOWEVER, it is going to become a problem thanks to all those smartasses who believe 'Space is for everyone' take it as 'I can take as much of it as I want' and start pumping out thousands and thousands of sats in LEO (Note: huge numbers in LEO are a much bigger problem than huge numbers in GEO). Yes, when you have 1000 Oneweb, 20000Stalink, 20000Chinese and God Knows What, then you have a problem in itself, ASAT or not, because one derelict sat is going to have many more things to crash into.

5. Dealing with debris. As mentioned, space is already filled with  stuff you can crash into. That's why most sats and ISS included  have armor plates attached, so a crash with a pebble won't ruin the whole thing. The second measure is, as mentioned  above, AVOIDANCE. Even small variations of energy can alter the orbit enough to allow. Dealing with Kessler? STOP OVERCROWDING LEO. Lower chances of collision, less stuff to be broken into tinier bits and more space for manouvers.

6. ' Russia's space capabilities lag behind the US and the free world's by decades at this point ' This sentence. There are currently only 3, let me spell it, THREE, countries capable of putting humans in space: Russia, US and China. So, to whoever wrote this bullshit and spreads it further, you've just insulted billions of people living in Europe, Canada, India, Japan, Australia and so on, by telling them their countries are some sort of dictatorship worse than Russia and China. Well, I guess this might be statement produced by someone who has to pay $40k to get a college diploma, while those poor dictatorships enjoy that benefit supported by the state.

7. Why do we have ASAT and ASAT tests? For the simple reason that space industries is not the 'we all live happilly togethere on this planet' you see in sci-fi. Space is and has always been a field for the military. The moment a conflict breaks out between any major militiaries, sat constellations are going to play a major role: SIGNIN, Photos, Drone Coordination, Missile Coordination, so obviously no one , not Russia, not US, not Iran, no nation, wants enemy sats over their heads and they want to do something about it, because, trust me, you wouldn't feel comfortable if an enemy nuclear power knew you have a military base in your town, either. To this, you have to add the principle of MAD, which has saved the world from nuclear winter many times in the past. If one nation obtains ASAT tech, they will try to leverage it, so it's the duty of the other nations to pose an equal threat to stop this leverage. You don't believe me? Check how many treaties limiting nuclear weapons  have been signed between US and USSR/Russia. Now check how many treaties US has exited from since they started deploying anti-ballistic systems on Russias borders. 

So, please, before you post any headline articles, use the full power of your braincells. Thanks for the read and see you soon.","About ASAT, Kessler syndrome and SHUT UP WITH POLITICS IN A SCIENCE SUB"

Several books that I've read, such as the Expeditionary Force series, talk about harvesting fuel from gas giant planets, but none of them ever discuss the atmospheric winds being a problem.  
So, what I'm wondering is, is there any way that we could build some sort of floating processing station in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant that could operate safely, with or without a crew?  Would any particular latitude work better than another, or even at one of the poles over the central vortex, for example?

The first is how, in the advanced stages of the universe's Degenerate Era, solar systems and galaxies are expected to dissolve as their matter collides, gets swallowed by stars and black holes, or gets ejected via gravity. My question is: why does the ejected matter not encounter other ejected matter and form new structures? I understand that the expansion of the universe will make it dilute and less dense, but surely matter will keep encountering matter and becoming gravitionally bound to it before they all become causally disconnected?

My other question is: is there a possibility ""dark energy"" will one day cease due to the fabric of space being stretched to a point where it cannot be stretched further? I'm not talking a big rip, but rather a point where the universe continues to exist and has reached maximum expansion because the properties of vacuum don't allow it to expand anymore?",A question relating to Dark Energy and gravity.

Sound would be very different on Mars than on Earth and we will find out how different as soon as Percy lands. It has 2 microphones. But I'm curious about sonic booms specifically. I was watching the Netflix show Away and they talk about detecting a sonic boom on Mars using a seismograph. So, to restate the original question, would sonic booms work the same on Mars? I have to imagine going the opposite extreme and imagining how it would work on Venus, I would say you wouldn't need to go as fast on Venus as you would on earth. And on Mars you'd have to be going many times faster than you would on earth to create a sonic boom. In order for the pressure to build at the leading edge, you need substance. So a thin atmosphere would take a lot more speed than a thick one... Right?",Mars and other planets' atmospheres and sound

space,"Some nerd on reddit did the math for me, thanks nerd, you'll get water balloons named after you. Anyways, here's my business plan; fooking YEETING roughly 26,420 US gallon sized metal water balloons to deliver that wet-wet to thirsty af homies in other countries, using reusable rockets.

Hear me out. I know this sounds vaguely familiar to imperialist military strategy, but no, this payload is totally just water collected in the rainforest.

This is the crazy ideas reason because I'm taking this idea to the max. Can we justify destroying like a square mile of pristine irreplaceable rainforest to collect an insane volume of water and fill up a nearby tank for solving droughts and getting fresh water to the dudes around the world who need it?

Not just like, here's enough water to not die of thirst amounts, but like an open source freshwater hookup. Like, oh your desert geography has a deep rock-lined reservoir built by us taxpayers and Army Corps of Engineers, that seems like an ideal space to create an oasis and relief terrible stresses from regions forecasted to have excess drought, or nonexistent fresh water supply (open desert facilities).

Free industrial farming amounts of freshwater to feed massive agricultural industry under the searing sun are subsidized by paying first-world problem farmers. Pop one of these massive tanks in the ground and you got big political influence in the farmers tending to land building a previously non-existent economy into an agricultural juggernaut, and making first-world farming completely automated process in desert region, very cheap land for farming out there hahaha. You invest into this totally broken region by ABSOLUTELY YEETING water balloons by rockets, thousands of gallons per launch. 

Or build a prefab design that's just like a big cornhole box that will catch all the gallons of water that recharge the tank for very isolated and independent farming operations from massive central water tanks guarded by the military. We turn these countries into our breadbasket on our terms cause we got that wet-wet u-knowumsaiyan. Our slogan will be, if you got a hole we got that wet-wet.

You don't need to fly that aggressively either since it would just be sub-orbital trajectories for the yeet-proper. You just need the hookup for fuel production (Hydrogen/oxygen) powered by one of those SMR nuclear plants.

space,"My interest in Space Habitats has recently rekindled :)

Looking at different visions of Habitats, specifically the Stanford Torus and Kalpana One, there are always a few things that bother me (maybe wrongly):

\- The windows are so large! Why? This is especially apparent with O'Neill Cylinders, where half the available space is just glass. Could the transparent area not just be a rather small slit? The outside Mirrors concentrate the light there, and an inside mirror then disperses the light again? Seeing the stars rotate around you will make people only dizzy.

\- The inside area looks always like a Park, with smallish single-family homes. Spread over a wide area. Who lives like that? In an expensive habitat real estate would be very costly. The population should live in multi-storey (4-5 levels) apartment complexes, rather densely around central infrastructure. These villages would then have additional radiation shielding, reinforced windows, and bulkheads towards the rest of the structure. Specifically, the Stanford Torus should not be one uninterrupted volume without bulkheads.

\- Rivers, Lakes and Parks. They look pretty, I get it. But the floor would be a steel, topped of with some regolith for shielding and then probably closed with something like Concrete.  I can't think water (!) or moist earth will help to constantly inspect the hull. I would rather think the inside looks like a parking lot, but then with RAISED flower-vegetable beds and water basins.

space,"Space suits are a hard problem, the suit needs to be pressurised but humans lack the strength/stamina to bend a pressurised suit so you have to add joints. Designing joints is hard and you still have issues like gloves and hear stories how astronauts on the ISS loose fingernails operating those suits.

But it got me thinking Japan and the US Military have been designing exoskeletons. In Japan it is so the elderly and infirm can get around and in the US its to create super solders. Videos of various systems are super impressive in the degrees of motion and what they can add.

What if you ditched the joints in a spacesuit and went all fabric and then attached an exoskeleton to the suit. The idea would be the exoskeleton gives you the extra force needed to bend the elbow, etc.. 

You could even do this with gloves since there are commercial solutions which provide gloves that give detailed readings of what your hands are doing.

Considering the Artemis suits will cost billions and so far the various versions of these kinds of exoskeletons cost millions. It seems an obvious win..","Spacesuits, why no robot exoskeleton?"

space,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil_(cosmology)

Give that page a quick read. I hadn't heard of this anomaly before. Essentially it says that when you look at the data of the CMBR, the image that we get shows certain symmetry which we wouldn't expect. The image is as if the Earth is in a special location because the image is divided up in a perfect way which only works from our location.

This speaks deeply to the Copernican Principle, which states Earth isn't supposed to be in a special place, it's just supposed to be like any old random place anywhere else in the universe.

""But when you look at CMB map, you also see that the structure that is observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun – the plane of the earth around the sun – the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe."" -Lawrence Krauss

I think we're all used to the sci-fi idea of Earth being the capital world of a vast united interstellar community. But think about the massive distances we require to traverse; dozens to hundreds to thousands of light years. The two options open to us are therefore: slow-moving generational ships / fleets, or ships travelling at relativistic speeds. 

Which ever option we use, our furthest colonies are going to be in complete isolation from Earth, making it more likely that each colony will be self-sufficient and independent from Earth entirely, or that there will be a central world to each region, similar to a decentralised union, like the European Union; but rather than being united politically, these worlds are united genetically. 

The most interesting aspect of this to me is, that, given millions of years, many of these colonists would have diverged in their evolution from the humans on Earth to suit their new environments. At that point could they really be classed as human?",Speculative: what would an interstellar human civilisation look like?

space,"Hey Space friends,

I'm Thomas. I work with Python since a few years and my main topics are related to data science / engineering, machine learning and astronomy. My background is astrophysics and Solar System research. After a few years studying and working in the scientific community I changed to the  automotive industry with financial related topics; however I still work  on science related topics in my free time.

I the last couple of years I got some very specific, space science related Python skills, after I worked for the Philae Lander (Rosetta  mission to the comet 67P) and on a cosmic dust measuring device mounted  on the Cassini spacecraft (mission to Saturn). I did... well... science.  E.g., I used machine learning algorithms to handle and analyse the  data. I did Monte-Carlo simulations (also with Python), public outreach  material, my doctorate studies and so on. To give you an overview, I am  the first author of a meteor camera analysis paper, where the analysis  and almost all plots have been done with Python:

[https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf](https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf)

Now that you know my full name, you can also find me on other research work like this one:

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349)

Anyway, why am I here? I would like to ask you, the community, if something like a ""Medium Article series"" or something similar would be interesting for you to work on space related data and topics with Python?

I would like to share my knowledge and would like to show you for example:

* How to compute simple trajectories of spacecraft missions
* How to compute positions and orbits of asteroids, planets, etc.
* How  to determine the position of objects in the sky (+ brightness  computations, visibility on different geographic coordinates, etc.)
* How to ""answer"" space science related questions (so a series, where the content of a paper is being reproduced)
* Simple animations (like this attempt, I worked on a few years ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ))

Again: everything would be done in Python, and the corresponding scripts and tutorials would also be shared on Github. Executing the code could be done on Google Colaboratory.

Please let me know, what you think. Whether this tutorial idea has some potential or not. Please share your comments and also ideas or criticism. I would like to get some resonance and I also published a small introduction without any programming part yet, to build of a ""proper thread"" on Medium. A first programming part would follow on Tuesday.

space,"Please excuse my complete newb question. I’m just getting into the specifics of space missions, and I’ve been listening to each of the three [Apollo In Real Time](www.apolloinrealtime.com) missions, and it’s so much fun. Learning so much, from big stuff like rocket staging, down to tiny stuff like the NOUN and VERB entries in the DSKY. 

So, my question is this:

Shortly after the Trans-Lunar Injection, each of the Apollo missions performed Transposition and Docking, flipping the command module and docking with the LM. Since it was performed mere minutes after the burn that sent them to the moon, I assume obviously they were traveling at the 30,000fps (can’t remember exactly) when they performed the maneuver. What I don’t understand is, after the separation which I believe was performed with a pyro blast, what kept one of the two sections (or both) from being knocked off course a little, making it harder or impossible for the command module to navigate into the dock? I get that the pyro separates them and the pilot rolls around 180°, but couldn’t the separation cause one of their trajectories to change, and at that speed, creating a “chase” of sorts to occur? It seemed to be a relatively easy process, except Apollo 14, which I think was just a matter of the latches engaging. I hope I’m making sense. The speed at which they’re traveling, seems as if either section got nudged from the SEP, couldn’t things go badly very quickly?  

Second question is just curiosity. A bit later when they jettison they S-IVB, I realize they perform an evasive maneuver so it doesn’t come back and make contact, but, it was traveling pretty quickly. Where is it now!?

From what I read, I understand that it is done so in order to save on fuel and instead increase the useful cargo that will be taken to the ISS. 

My question is - is this tradeoff worth the effort and ISS fuel/propellant to be used to lower the orbit and then respectively raise it again (to compensate for the atmospheric drag)?

The team, to its credit, accomplished pretty much everything they set out to do on an accelerated schedule, but then, when they needed additional capital to finish the build-out and launch... the additional capital they had been counting on failed to materialize on reasonable terms.

space,"Hi everyone! My name is Zane Landers and as you have probably seen on this sub and at the top of /r/all these past couple days, I make my own telescopes. By popular demand, I'm doing an AMA! I really didn't think I'd be here or doing this and would like to thank all of you from /r/space, /r/telescopes, /r/all, and other subreddits and websites where my post has been shared. I never could've dreamed of any of this!

[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/OT6Y219.jpg)

I've built a lot of telescopes, from my first - a [6"" f/4.3](https://i.imgur.com/MhLih97.jpg) with a mirror I made that's been in *Sky &amp; Telescope* and [TIME](https://time.com/longform/amateur-astronomers-stargazing-photos/), to janky [16](https://i.imgur.com/aKvwSi8.jpg) and [20.5](https://i.imgur.com/0hRLnCu.jpg)-inchers, [a pair of 6-inchers](https://i.imgur.com/zS3QvhH.jpg) for a STEM class I co-taught, my [10"" f/3.2 wide-field scope](https://i.imgur.com/bTZHcuM.jpg), prototype [10"" f/5.6](https://i.imgur.com/EcQah4N.jpg) and [12"" f/5](https://i.imgur.com/xBxEvo9.jpg) scopes, and now my [14.7"" f/2.89](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/frdd1d/im_17_years_old_and_just_finished_building_this/). I also wrote the stickies for /r/telescopes and /r/binoculars and most of the reviews and guides for [TelescopicWatch.com](https://telescopicwatch.com/). I've also owned and refurbished quite a few commercially-manufactured scopes, my favorite being my 1972 Celestron C8 [\(before](https://i.imgur.com/7a4r7kB.jpg)/[after](https://i.imgur.com/4fNoDe4.jpg)) which I got repainted with the help of a professional auto body shop and had to do a complete mechanical restoration of.

space,"# The lack of evidence of other intelligent life is likely due to a combination of factors, but the primary explanation is that it’s just exceedingly rare.  But why is intelligence rare?

1)  There's credence to the Rare Earth Hypothesis.  Consider how many factors were seemingly at play to allow Earth to develop complex life (and ultimately intelligence):

* Located in a stable galaxy with favorable timing in its own galactic evolutionary process
* Located in an ideal position in that galaxy - far from the chaos towards the center of the galaxy where supernovas are more common, but close enough where you still benefit from being seeded with heavy metals, mixing of the necessary building blocks, etc.
* The right star (K or G spectral type seem to be ideal)
* Favorable planetary setup including a large gas giant to gobble up excess debris like Jupiter
* The right physical characteristics of the planet itself:
   * the right size (\~0.75 to \~2 Earth masses seems favorable)
   * proper composition and just the right amount of water (Earth's total mass is just .023% water; what if it was 1%?)
   * a stable orbit at the proper distance from the star
   * a magnetic field to protect from radiation
   * plate tectonics to help recycle carbon
   * an atmosphere that isn't too thick or thin
   * a large enough moon to stabilize the planet’s axis (Earth's moon is an anomaly in our solar system, at least for planet-sized bodies aside from Pluto-Charon)
* Sheer luck
   * avoidance of severe extinction level events where life is nearly or completely sterilized from the planet.  Earth needed relative stability for 2.5 BILLION YEARS for single cell life to evolve into complex multicellular life.  Earth has had a few major extinctions, but none as severe as I'm describing
   * chance events creating evolutionary niches (for example, the extinction of the dinosaurs arguably helped give rise to mammals and ultimately humans)

2)  Evolution of intelligence itself is the ""Great Filter""

* Out of the countless species that have evolved in Earth’s 4.5 billion years, only ONE species –  humans – has developed what we refer to as “intelligence” AND it took one third of the life of the universe for that to happen
* Too much intelligence may NOT be a favorable evolutionary trait.  Intelligence could lead to excessive manipulation of the environment and ultimately self-destruction.  Some animal species and close relatives of those species (for example, crocodiles) have survived relatively unchanged for a couple hundred million years.  Is the goal of life to survive eons or “thrive” as humans have for only a couple hundred thousand years?

3)  Conditions in the universe have only recently (within the last 6 billion years or so) become favorable for complex life to thrive

* The universe was a much more violent place during the first half its existence (excessive supernovas, gamma ray bursts, etc.)
* There were fewer life building atoms out there than the present (i.e. heavier elements than H and He).  Maybe complex life (and on the rare occasion, intelligence) is just now becoming more common

# All that being said, I do think intelligent civilizations do arise on occasion just given the sheer size and age of the universe.  So, why don’t we have any evidence of them?

1)  We are separated by too much time and space

* One civilization might've evolved just a few dozen light years from Earth, but it lived and died out 3 billion years ago.  There could be another currently in existence, but it’s 10,000+ light years away.

2)  The standard evolutionary progression for life is:  single cell life -&gt; complex life -&gt; intelligence -&gt; computers/AI

* When biological intelligence evolves to merge with computers/AI, the will for exploration decreases substantially as all needs are satisfied on the civilization's home planet and/or the virtual world.
* This evolutionary step to computers/AI is consistently achieved BEFORE technology advances to the point where interstellar travel/exploration becomes feasible.

3)  The evolution of biological intelligence into computer intelligence is a consistent road block for further progression to a true Type II+ civilization

* Would highly advanced computers really require more energy than that of an entire star?  At what point is the gathering of additional information (and related energy requirement) not needed for survival, particularly for an AI that would probably already understand the nature of reality and the universe by that point?  Maybe that’s extremely naïve since we probably can't even conceive what purpose such a powerful computer would serve.  If a civilization/its computers were to advance to such a level, they'd probably have the ability to create whole virtual universes that are indistinguishable from reality (which is maybe an explanation of why we’re here in the first place!)

4)  If Type II+ civilizations do arise on the extremely rare occasion, their technology is so advanced that we might not be able to recognize them or their technology at all

* They could easily remain hidden if they wanted to.  This is when the Zoo Hypothesis and the “highway next to an ant hill” analogy come into play

space,"Sorry for the patato quality video. I will describe the event we witnessed as detailed as possible and give my own theories, but I'd like to hear some other opinions.

We were out near a lake when we saw what appeared to be a comet descending quickly from the sky. First it looked like a star followed by 3 bright lines. As it got closer to the ground it broke appart looking like a firework when it first explodes, slowly forming a kind of sand watch shaped fireball about the size of a full moon, which you can see in the video. It descended further until dissapearing behind the tree line.

I have two theories about the event:

1. It was a meteor.
2. It was the Soyuz 2.1 rocket launched from Plesetzk. The time of launch stated by Roscosmos matches the time the video was taken but the rockets flight path is a bit far away from where we recorded the video. Here is more info about the rocket:

So recently I heard the exciting news that we possibly discovered microbial extraterrestrial life in the clouds of the planet Venus. It’s exciting to hear but my question is, is that life from Venus? 

In the 1960s the Soviet Union sent multiple missions to the surface of Venus with probes, 

nearly all of them burned up in the atmosphere, 

but what if some bacteria hitched a ride on the Soviet spaceships and jumped off while it was going through the atmosphere, 

and in the past 60 years has been reproducing in the clouds and taking over the atmosphere.



Is it possible that the life that we might find is not Venusian life but Russian bacteria?

space,"hi all, i have a question. how does everybody now think that the presence of ph3 on venus is a sign of life?


afaik its mostly a speculation from the guys that discovered it.

dont get me wrong, i love alien life as much as the next guy, but isnt it just way more likely, that there are unknown chemical processes at work than that there is life in this very strange atmosphere. 
even more when we considere, that ph3 is known to be in the atmosphere of gasgiants jupiter and saturn.
i know the atmosphere there is different than on venus but bottom line venus atmosphere is pretty dense and gassy aswell.
 but isnt it way more likely we dont know everything about venus, than speculating about life there.

especially if we consider how much more the posibility of life gets attention in the media, compared to some strange chemical phenomena. 

i hope i am wrong, but to me this feels just like any other hip trend that goes trough the scientific community that makes the authors famous for a second just to be debunk shortly after.

space,"I personally have always believed that Life on Venus or Titan is way more likely than Mars. If we discover that this is life in the Venusian Atmosphere, That could mean two things.

\#1: This is proof of panspermia and that the Venusian life came from Earth or vice versa. This will show that Microbes can survive on collision debris and land on another object which will cause it to spread over the object. This would cause a whole new tree of evolution separate from our own, and billions of years later the life (Most likely a Bacteria analogue) would be releasing this gas.

\#2: The one we all probably are interested in, Life developed completely separate from us and that would be one of the biggest discovering's in history, Here's why. This will show that life in space is so unbelievably common that it developed twice in the same star system. This would prove that life in the universe is a extremely common event and that its everywhere where it can start. The search for life would increase exponentially and we will know that we share this universe with other possibly hyper intelligent species.

However, I wondered this morning if - assuming they weren't actually in a space shuttle where there is atmosphere and other masses about - if two m&amp;m's were distant enough from other masses that their relative gravity was the most significant source of gravity on their system, and they were moving at a constant (but tiny) velocity, would they orbit each other, and if so can we calculate what their 'year'would be?

As humanity continues to develop as a species over the next several centuries interstellar travel is inevitably going to be relevant and crossing the gap between stars relatively quickly with large numbers of people is going to become a necessity in order to colonize planets and for various other reasons as well.

when i blow on my tea, the bubbles on the surface go from a spinning ball into a spiral galaxy shape, with tails and all. my questions are: why is there a similarity in appearance, according to physics? what do these two phenomena have in common, aside from appearance? what can this tea teach us about how spiral galaxies form? what is it about the shape of the mug that causes this? is there a mug-like boundary, for example, stronger gravity that influences the formation of bodies in this shape in space? essentially, *what are the relevant and similar phenomena going on here between the two?* is it just appearance? or is there something more?

i realize these questions are probably looking super ignorant. but i am. i admit it. but i'm curious, and just looking to learn something new. i'm an undergrad in philosophy, so i understand basic theory, so feel free to cite some basic theory that would help me understand it a little better. you can do this by explaining both the formation of galaxies , and the tea galaxy lol, and giving the relevant, similar phenomena, or just anything tbh, just don't make it too theoretical haha. alright, here's a picture. thanks in advance! looking forward to hearing from you. cheers

space,"Hey, folks!

Some of you may be aware that top-grade space/EVA suits are costly. Although Armstrong's suit was said to be less than $1m (in today's money), newer types of missions and responsibilities require greater protection and more durability and function etc.

A NASA spacesuit, for example, is said to run into the millions of dollars (as high as $12,000,000) and the cost of the design and manufacturing etc of new types of suits is said to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

So I am interested in any ideas that anybody has in bringing down the general cost of EVA/space suits (remember, it's the whole deal - full suit, helmet, material, layers, oxygen, resistanc etc etc.)

For example, if a startup which was on the cusp of offering orbital commercial spaceflights to general consumers and wanted to also offer add-on options of extravehicular action, low-cost/cost-effective EVA/spacesuits would be ideal etc.

Notwithstanding that, general national space agencies would need to bring down the cost of EVA/spacesuits in the future anyway as the species begins to advance more into space and more astronauts exist and space travel begins to really take off.

Thoughts?

On the other side, we wanted to use the temperature sensor to identify the regions with the most greenhouse emissions, since the ozone layer reflects UV radiation and it is reflected as temperature, I was wondering if it would be enough to reflect which regions have the most greenhouse emission?

3) Monetary systems will be thrown completely out of balance, since we currently use an underlying asset (such as gold) to give money it's value. With access to more resources, we'll need to find a different system to measure value.

If a creature had the same proportions we have to earth the average “person” would be like 66 feet tall and weigh thousands of pounds. We would barely reach their shin.

space,"So, I have been thinking lately... I know scary.

We had a ""Planetary Resources"" Company that was working on research and development of space vehicles that were to, I guess the right terminology for this would be ""controlled Drift"" out to asteroids or the asteroid belt and scan asteroids for useful minerals and material in the prospect of mining. However, the company has since been bought out.  


With Elon and SpaceX looking to build a colony on Mars. The major drawback currently of space travel is moving resources from planet side into space. So, to cut back on the demand to launch things from our own planet the next step is to gather the minerals and material, refine it, and then construct things in space.  


Without a current research &amp; development company working on this in the United States at least. I was thinking what everything would be needed to go into a vessel to scan an asteroid.  
Here's what I was currently thinking:  
Solar panels for power  
Some sort of propellent for thrusters  
Thrusters obviously  
A Scanner or spectrogram to detect various resources  
and a 2 way antenna system to control the space craft and send back telemetry and scanning data.

space,"Hi Reddit ! I just created an account to share some thoughts, and i hope to discuss about them with you ! Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is a second language !

So, i was spending the night at a friend, and we decided to bring Lucy with us. Everything was fun and the mood was light during the first 3 hours.

Then, we decided to watch some videos about the universe, and talked about it till the end of the night. The first thing that kinda blew my mind was this, ""Life is the way the universe found to contemplate itself"". That's just a fallacy, but in this state it was really mind-blowing.

Then, I started to contemplate the fact that the universe is a closed system, and every particles it contains was once the ""same thing"" (hydrogen). And we humans don't just live inside, we are the universe. We are literally made from matter that was primary particle at some point. I started to think that conscience is just an overlay that other species are yet to acquire, and that this ability is just a logical evolutionary response to a world becoming more and more complex. I'm a atheist, so I don't think there is an afterlife like monotheist religions depict it. But after this night I am open to the idea that our particles, even though don't connect in a way for us to be conscient, can be part of a bigger system.

I wondered about *Loop Quantum Gravity*, which theorize that the universe is expanding, then collapsing on itself, and then start a new cycle. There are a lot of different theories that try to merge quantum physics and general relativity together, but I do like this one. If every particles can be arranged in every way an infinite amount of time, like this theory suggest, I guess it would be possible to live everything. I didn't really believe about reincarnation before that night, and I am a really pragmatic guy, but this night changed a lot for me I guess.

Founded by a group of space professionals from diverse backgrounds, the Zed Factor Fellowship empowers and engages learners and aspiring aerospace professionals from underrepresented backgrounds through hands-on, practical experiences working in and contributing to the leading companies of the aerospace community.

Help spread the word to all your aerospace communities! Please note, not all applicants need to have a technical background - there will be some positions available for non-engineers who have a passion for the aerospace industry. Another differentiating factor to the ZFF is that all fellows will create and conduct their own community service project, amplifying the impact of each fellowship far beyond one individual.  

Applications are currently being accepted for placement with leading aerospace companies for internships beginning in late spring/early summer 2021. More information can be found at our [website](https://zedfactorfellowship.org/), and questions can be directed to [info@zedfactorfellowship.org](mailto:info@zedfactorfellowship.org).  The deadline for applications is **January 4th, 2021.**

Together we will create an aerospace industry and technical cadre of professionals comprising of people of all backgrounds, creating a more inclusive, well-rounded and ultimately more impactful and effective nation and world.

space,"I've been doing a bit of daydreaming and started to wonder what humanity would look like in a 100, 1000, 10000 years. Assuming humanity doesn't do something stupid in the next 10000 years...

Personally I reckon,

100 years : Humans would have functioning research outposts/labs (like the ISS) on the Moon and on Mars. The colonies would be comprised of scientists and engineers who would be doing experiments to explore the possibility of self sustainable colonies. We will look at how to make resources such as food, water, rocket fuel insitu and look at how a small colony would be able to thrive.

1000 years: Humans would have explored most of the solar system by probes and rovers. We would have self sufficient colonies on the Moon and Mars. The colonies would consist of Scientists, Engineers and workers who are on 1 - 2 year secondments (kinda like Antarctic research stations). All required resources for a self sustaining colony would be produced on the planet. We would have robotic outposts on the outer planets and moons which are used for scientific research and study. Hopefully advances in medicine and technology will allow humans to be more resilient (no more cancer etc.) and we will be able to live much longer (150 years+).

10000 years: Humanity would have started to venture out towards our nearest habitable solar systems (like the Trappist system). Hopefully by this time we would have discovered interstellar speeds (0.05c - 0.1c) which would allow us to send starter colonies to various exoplanets. The starter colonies would be controlled by an almost sentient AI robot army which would take a colony of 100k - 250k embryos and incubate and raise them on the planet. The Humans from our solar system will never visit these exoplanets but we will know of life on them. The colonies would be completely self sustaining and would be completely independent of Sol.

space,"Hi everyone! 

I'm not entirely sure if this type of post is allowed on this subreddit (and I apologise for any strange formatting as I'm on mobile) so here goes nothing:

Three years ago, the day after Christmas 2017, my father suffered a massive stroke which affected not only his speech and critical thinking abilities, but most importantly left the left side of his body partially paralysed. He did speech and movement rehab for the first year and a half but after a certain point we had to keep him from attending because we just financially couldn't afford it any longer. Nowadays, since my father is unable to work because of how much the stroke mentally and physically affected him, my mom has to work 3 jobs to pay rent and support both of them. I pitch in as much as I can a month to help them, but with the job market these days being so troublesome due to the virus, it's getting harder for us to cope financially.

Now, I'm here on this subreddit because my father has always been a big astronomy guy! We got him a nice telescope the Christmas of 2016 which he used nightly for an entire year, but after his stroke we sadly had to sell it to help pay for his hospital expenses and ever since then he's really had nothing. My family, of course, includes him in everything we do but he's been so depressed this last year ever since the pandemic started that we're worried about his mental health. We know he'd love to have a telescope again so I'm here to simply ask for relatively cheap recommendations for a telescope a partially paralysed man can use comfortably.

He is able to move his left arm and hand now, but only a bit so a telescope that can be moved using a type of external remote control would be ideal as his hands are extremely shaky so positioning it to see things would be difficult. Another thing would be since he's really unable to critically think now, something that has coordinates built in where you can just click wheat you want to see and it moves the telescope for you would be best. The budget is $300 since we really can't afford anything more than that.

I know this is a lot to ask and I apologise for it being a longer post and for the formatting, I'm just trying to get this posted quick so I can help my mom order something soon to get it before Christmas.

Thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to those who choose to respond (if anyone even sees this post, haha! Fingers crossed!)",Need help finding a telescope for my father who suffered a stroke.

space,"Hi,

I don't see the point of space colonisation. For clarity, by ""space colonisation"" I mean people living permanently on other celestial bodies, raising children, with no plans to return to Earth. 

The only practical purpose that has been suggested to me, is that, in the case of some apocalypse on Earth, humanity would survive on other celestial bodies. 

This doesn't hold water, in my opinion. Given how inhospitable other celestial bodies are, the level of cataclysm that would need to affect Earth would have to be on a scale not seen for possibly hundreds of millions of years, in order to render Earth *even less hospitable* than, say, Mars for example. 

Planning for a threat that isn't likely to occur for (at least) tens of millions of years isn't credible under any circumstances. Moreover, there are serious costs to space colonisation, namely:

1. Resources, to create artificial habitats on other bodies, and send people there

2. The ethical problems of causing people to be born into extremely artificial environments, that they won't be able to leave

3. The propagation of the damaging and untrue idea that Earth is replaceable.

So why bother?",What is the practical purpose for space colonisation?

But this dream was different, We had a deep connection and conversations, we both knew it was a dream and I even told her that I’ve seen her in other dreams and she said the same. So we fell in love, almost like my first love it was so strong and such a long everlasting dream and since I have seen her in other dreams before and I have also seen this “futuristic” place before I can’t shake the feeling that I know her but not yet (if that makes sense?) Ever since last night I can’t stop thinking about her - to the point where I’ve even thought about going to Iceland to see if my dreams are trying to tell me something. I know she’s nobody I know in real life, I would’ve married her by now hahaha but in all seriousness I know she’s a foreigner because of the accent and language barrier and the fact in some dreams she is with other Icelandic people and I’m with other Americans. I just wanted to share this experience I’ve been having and wanted to see if anyone else has had similar dreams? Is it normal to see the same exact person and sometimes the same place even though I’ve never met her?

I have kind of a random question for everyone.  A few years ago I stumbled upon a news article about some detection of something in outer space and i am trying to find it again.  The problem is my memory of the article is poor at this point but I do have some recollection of some of its key points.  I am hoping that somebody will recognize it after I mention those key points.  I remember it mentioned something about a pattern for which a probability of authenticity was calculated.  The article said that either the signal was legitimate or someone faked it by setting some events in motion approximately 400 years ago, which was extremely unlikely but I think a probability was calculated.  I am trying to figure why it was narrowed to those two possibilities instead of just one but I need to see the article again.  Does an article like this seem familiar to anyone?

These days I feel like this sub is a graveyard. Stripped down to press releases, occasional NASA tweets and the occasional rocket photograph. Why?! Why is nothing allowed in this sub?

Why can’t people post crazy stories from the Apollo era, why can’t rocket photographers and cinematographers post awesome footage of rocket launches, why can’t breaking news or tweets from non official accounts be shared? 

This place could be the hub it used to be, where I learned, was inspired and stayed on top of current space science and spaceflight events. Now that’s reserved for /r/SpaceX and a few other active subs. 

My point is, without this place, I don’t think I would have been inspired to pursue my career. And I just don’t see that happening anymore. What’s the worst that happens? Too much space and rockets on the front page? Oh no!!! Heaven forbid we get more people excited to learn more about the exciting things going on!

We would watch the sunrise above Moab from Dead Horse Point State Park every morning and one day it looked like a rocket or a plane was rising with the sun and I got my sky view app to find out  it was actually Venus. So Venus was visible early morning rising with the sun however I am in Texas right now and Venus is next to the moon so my question is how often can you see Venus rise with the sun like we did in utah I’m trying to Google it but nothings coming up. I don’t think Google understands my question. It says on venus the sun rises every 117 days so does this occur maybe every 117 days? So is that how it appears to us from earth every 117 days and that’s why it looks as though Venus is rising with the Sun. Honestly it was just the coolest thing to watch it looked as though they were both moving so fast and I want to see this phenomenon again.,How often does Venus rise with the sun?

space," Here is some thoughts of mine on the reality of the cosmos so this post is based on the space we are residing in at least until we reach our demise. We will die and no one understands what happens upon your complete end of 3rd dimensional existence. I have some theories of what I would believe to be God. He is the supreme power and the one who controls the power and energy given out. This would possibly mean that energy can be destructive or it can be its opposite nondestructive. As far as humans on earth go we can be destructive to each other. Now this is where this all leads into this form of thought I am presenting to you here. These are my thoughts that I created into this creation and I hope they will interest you. If God is the supreme being then this would suggest that their is justice for ones destructive behavior. Anything is possible and the impossible can also be possible maybe not in a 3rd dimensional sense but as a more powerful awareness that could be part of this universal consciousness.

Good and bad is based of morals if people don't understand that. People don't understand good and evil and its focused all on morality. When someone gets hurt from an immoral act it feels unjustified. If we are to let this person heal from their wounds we want to make sure he feels better. Take him to the hospital he will heal and in return he will be happy because of this. This is considered moral to help someone when they are being treated unfairly. Being a good person is actually a thing that people don't quite understand there is some context to it that needs to be evaluated.

Now as far as anything else in our cosmos is yet to be determined. This is one aspect of reality that is I believe if I'm not mistaken to be judgment from God of the bad things we do which in a sense makes sense. Then again these are theories. If love were to be what holds this universe together then everyone in our family would be connected by love and everyone you have ever met. This would prove that you cannot kill these people without having consequences and fairness for the actions you have committed and the way they specifically affected the human being. God is the light to my knowledge and is the creator of your life.",This is based off scientific thinking and an evaluation of reality and the cosmos.

space,"We know that our relative speed has an impact on the flow of time. When something moves faster, time appears to stay the same for the traveler but the rest of the universe speeds up from their perspective. So if someone were to go shooting around at 99% the speed of light for an hour they might come back to earth and realize much more time has passed here. 

So our relative speed can appear to speed up or slow down time for the rest of the universe around us as the traveler. . But relative to what? to mass? To some center point of the universe? 

If we understand what our relative speed is in reference to, could we in theory propel a space station in the opposite direction to essentially ""stand still"" ? Perhaps it is our galaxy as a whole causing us to experience the flow of time at the rate we are used to? So if we could somehow exit our galaxy and stand still in space away from all mass, would we start to notice other objects in space around us seem to be moving more slowly, since we have essentially slowed time down for ourselves?  

And what could be the practical uses for something like this? for example what if Earth was faced with a doomsday event, but our scientists needed more time to solve the problem. Could we launch them into space on a station that would make time slow down, such that a week here could feel like a month to them?  Then once they solved the problem, communicate the information back somehow?","Could we nearly ""freeze"" time on the rest of the universe?"

But thinking about this geometrically, if you need to keep the sunshield between the telescope and the sun, then it can only be oriented in certain ways with the shield towards the sun.  Pictures of the telescope are always shown with the telescope pointing along the same plane as the sunshield, implying that with the shield facing the sun, the telescope can only point along a plane perpendicular to the direction to the sun, not away from the sun as this would expose the back of the telescope to the sun.

Does anyone know how this will work?  Does the telescope actually articulate relative to the shield so that it can point directly away from the sunshield?  I presume observations in directions towards the sun have to wait until later in the year when they become away from the sun, but I can't fully understand how it can maintain flexibility to cover the whole sky while remaining behind the shield. Anyone know?",JWST - Does the sunshield limit which directions it can observe.

space," 1) Space science facts for kids The Sun is more than 3,00,000 (3 Lakh) times larger than the size of the Earth, which means 1 million Earths could fit inside the sun.    


2) Space is absolutely silent as there’s no atmosphere for sound to travel through!    


3) It isn’t possible to walk on planets like Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, or Uranus as they don’t have a solid surface! They’re mostly made up of different gases.    


4) The moon doesn’t emit any light of its own. The light from the sun’s rays bounce off of the moon and reach the Earth in a matter of 1.25 seconds. This is how we get moonlight.    


5) No life form can survive if they were to enter a black hole, like the one at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Even light can’t survive in a black hole.    


6) The reason the ocean has waves and has tides that switch from high to low is that the gravitational pull from the moon and the sun keep changing.    


7) Do you know what the highest mountain known to man is? If you said Mount Everest, you’re only partially correct. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, but the highest mountain known to man is actually present on an asteroid called Vesta and is 22km in height: thrice as big as Everest    


8) There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on Earth.    


9) Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon in 1969.    


10) Did you know that you can still see traces of his footprints on the moon’s surface? This is because there’s no wind on the moon, and so the footprints and tire tracks are still pretty intact!    


11) It is believed that there are between 200-400 billion stars just in the Milky Way galaxy, of which our solar system is a very, very tiny part. In the observable universe, there are about 100 billion galaxies like the Milky Way. There could be around 100 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone!

space,"The title is a good summary, I just hope I'm in the right place. This doesn't seem to be against any rules in the sidebar, but let me know and I'll delete the post.

I am a recent graduate (2021) mechanical engineering major from Rutgers University with a focus in AE. Like everyone in this sub I'm a space nerd and I'd love to do engineering work that's related to it in some way. 


My biggest issue though, is that I really don't want to help design or manufacture weapons. I would rather do work on more science/instrumentation/space vehicle based stuff. So to this end, I ask if anyone knows how I would find companies that do that kind of work in space as opposed to defense contractors. (NASA is not quite within my reach just yet, lol) 

To give an idea of what I'd like to do, I recently applied to an engineering position with NRAO at the Very Large Array. My hopes aren't high because its a big name and I'm a fairly mediocre candidate, but I'd love some suggestions on where/what to start with to find myself somewhere similar in a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, also two years ago, u/A_Lazko provided [a link to a placeholder in the Open Library for the English edition of the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/cdgrhw/gravitational_slingshot_trajectory_to_accelerate/etu08hf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) published in 1997. Alas, it's only a placeholder; it doesn't have the actual book.

&amp;#x200B;

Not surprisingly, the book's English edition is out of print, so I haven't been able to find it in any bookstore.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone please point me to the book's English edition? For those that don't know, this is the book that the Apollo program used to get humans to the Moon and back.

**1)**  Do you believe we could be living in a ""protected"" region of space by ""the"" I mean THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe from the lesser advanced predator aliens species ? I mean if we consider that some region of space in the universe are ""older"" and some ""younger"" from others by the activity of space itself (star creation, super novae destruction, black holes etc) it would be reasonable to assume some aliens species are older than some others. We could be living in the middle of a vast intergalactic communications system and can't see it yet..it could be all around us in a different format... in the same way that we couldn't understand / see the cosmic microwave background, or gravitational waves, black holes and things like that a few hundred years ago. Also if we live in that ""protected"" region of space it would explain many things like the lack of any proof of advanced aliens species yet, the silence, nothing detected etc in the same way that we protect animals in a zoo.


**2)**  Could it be possible too that ""the"" THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe (like the really top) and the oldest, are being of pure""energy"" no more biological, or robotics or things like that.. if they were in front of us would they be indistinguishable from nature to us because they are so advanced ? (e.g imagine Ancients in Stargate) I mean like, immortal beings who knows mostly everything on how the universe work... billions years old civilizations... it would be pointless for them to hurt us in the same way it's pointless for us to kill a ant ? Could theses beings exist and make the others behave or listen ? by being so advance too... do you believe that they have ""no choice"" in being inherently ""good"" because they can destroy everything / anything in ways we can't imagine ? life creation/protection/expansion would be the most essential thing for them ? If we believe in theses multiverse multidimensions theories, do you think theses being could move from a universe/dimension to another ? or even create universe or galaxy themselves ? If we imagine a long road with water on it, it would be reasonable to assume 1 universe is a water hole and some water hole are connected.


**3)**  On a final thought... if we see the universe as a ""finite/infinite region of space"" in term of ""space"" like the space you have in your house, could theses being move inside that region of space in ways that we can't imagine yet ? I mean instead of having a spaceship with fuel and a propulsion system with a engine, like a human would think, could they use the ""darkness"" of space I mean space ""itself"" like scientist like to call the ""aether""... as a way to move or teleport from region to region extremely fast or instantly ? play/move with the aether as a wave or tunnel to travel long distance or do others things ? by being energy beings they wouldn't require a spaceship / suits / or whatever they could ""be"" just there ? I mean existing in a space / dimension in a place without requiring anything but themselves. From a very fundamental point of view I believe we can explain the big things from the small things, and the complex things from the easy things. I also believe that from the ""natural progression""  of life itself on earth in every aspect social technical mental etc, that it's not far fetched that a ""evolution lader "" exist in nature, which is related to time itself... a relationship directly proportional with itself meaning that the more time pass the wiser you are, the more advanced you are, the more conscious and intelligent you are.

2) does the radiation from solar winds affect the composition of raw minerals in outer space?

But what's going to be different about the new lunar space suits compared to the current ISS EVA suits? They'll probably be lighter and have more mobility in the legs but is there anything else?

Over the last few nights, I've been stargazing and watching the Perseid meteor shower for short intervals.

However, I've noticed over the last two nights that there's something I haven't come across before. I can only describe it as a swirling white flash, as if someone's taken a paintbrush and drawn 3 quarters of a hollowed out circle in white paint if that makes sense? These flashes last about half a second or less, and I did think my mind was playing tricks on me, but I've seen about 4 in the last 48 hours. They don't appear to originate from one location in particular, as they've been spread out quite a distance from one another.

Any ideas what these could be please? Sorry if this has a really simple solution that I haven't thought about or if it's a stupid question, I'm just very curious.

And we waited several thousands of years to feel the effect on earth, since we have to wait for the gravitational waves to reach us.


In terms of the Newtonian perspective:

1) Would Earth's gravity become stronger? So would gravitational pull on Earth accelerate objects faster?

2) Would all stars in the Milkyway galaxy be accelerated faster through space do to the gravitational effects of TON 618?

3) How would TON 618 effect the Milkyway interaction with other nearby galaxies? (For example, Would our speed increase relative to our neighboring galaxies?)

In terms of Einstein General Relativity:

4) How can TON 618 affect the flow of objects being tossed in the air on Earth? 

I would further envision the question above as, ""The expectant resultant gravitational pull of TON 618 on Earth's surface turned out to not be true, and instead we observed the gravitational pull to be different than our calculations based on Newtonian Law of Universal Gravitation. This could only be explained in terms of Einstein General Relativity; where gravity is an illusion of mass traveling in straight lines through the curvature of space time.

The launch cost of a Starship will likely be about 1,5-2 million dollars (as per [Elon's tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1328770804222468097)) and an empty flight ready Starship hull will likely cost about [5 million dollars](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/03/two-thousand-spacex-super-heavy-starship-launches-for-the-price-of-one-sls-launch.html). The market for seagoing yachts in the price range of about 10-30 million dollars is surprisingly big. 

So I think you could make a business case for actual privately owned Space Yachts.

    Starship hull:    $ 5 M
    Interior:         $15 M
    Total cost:       $20 M

Of course you would still have to pay extra for the launch costs and the refurbishment, but for big seagoing yachts even the mooring costs can also add up quickly. So the upkeep of seagoing yachts and Space Yachts might be considered equal for the sake of the argument, although with the additional launch costs for the Space Yachts. 

Space is a pricy hobby. 

# Ability

What can one expect when purchasing a Space Yacht? The cruise on such a yacht will be very different from a cruise on a seagoing yacht. The main attraction wouldn't be sun, wind and water, but the breathtaking view of earth and weightlessness. 

For launch one of the SuperHeavy boosters from your local space port would be rented. 

How long does a cruise on a privately owned seagoing yacht last? I honestly don't have a solid idea, but I don't think it will last longer than 1-2 weeks on average. Maybe a month.   
The same kind of time span would be ideal for a space yacht.   
It would also be possible to launch into the orbit of a public/private space station for a short stay-over during the cruise. There you could meet some of your equally rich friends to play some ""space golf"" or whatever.

You could either land back in the space port you took off from, or in a different spot on earth. 

Even direct earth-to-earth flights without using the SuperHeavy booster would be possible. 

While you are not using your space yacht it would be ""moored"" to a space port. 

When purchasing additional fuel from tankers in low earth orbit a flight around the moon would also be within the realms of possibility. (Like the [\#dearmoon project](https://dearmoon.earth/)) 

&amp;#x200B;

What a Starship-based Space Yacht obviously can't do is providing quick trips the rings of Saturn or the moons of Jupiter. The trip would take far to long (years of even decades). It's an earth-locked system just as normal yachts are bound to the sea.

So - what are your thoughts on returning to one of the Apollo sites? I personally wish it could be labeled a world heritage site and left untouched, but obviously that can’t happen. 

Eventually we’re likely to have a country or private company land near say Apollo 11, perhaps steal things like the plaque on the LM stairs. Or the moon buggy from Apollo 17, and try to profit from it. Although bringing back a 50-60+ year old piece of an Apollo mission to earth could provide a lot of science.

After being frustrated with not being able to share and collaborate on links with friends and family, I created SeeLink, a platform to simplify sharing and collaborating on links with friends and family.  you can find it at [https://seelink.app](https://seelink.app/)

Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. SeeLink allows its users to create boards to share links with individuals / groups of people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button. 

 After 3 months of work, I have created a complete platform that simplifies link sharing and collaboration, allowing you to seamlessly share, save, and collaborate on links with groups of up to 50 people at a time. I'm super excited to finally launch SeeLink and get it out to the world!

Not long after, I noticed a third. It was moving as would be expected, in a straight line at a constant velocity travelling north. After around a minute, it started to wobble slightly. I’m not sure if this actually happened, or if my eyes were misinterpreting what I was seeing.

Regardless, it slowly began to bank to the right, and after a minute or two was travelling in a straight line east. I don’t suspect it to be a plane or helicopter, as it seemed far too high up and the light remained solid. Any thoughts?",Strange Moving Satellite

Ok so he'res what basically happens. Planet 9- which will be nicknamed idk, hades for now, carries two mens, that perserved a lot of the planets internal heat. However it becomes attracted to the gravity of Jupiter, which slightly changes the planets trajectory. 

As it crossed an astroid belt, one of the bigger atroids became affected by Hades' pull, and began following it's original trajectory

As they near our planets, the meteor thats nearly the size of a moon directly impacts Venus, causing an unimaginable destruction. The force is so strong it pushes Venus outwards. Venus will travel aimlessly in space for about a year until it begins to orbit the sun again.

Hades finds itself comfortably between Mars and Jupiter. Hades gravity once again pulls mars off it's current trajectory. Eventually Mars becomes affected by the closest planets gravity- Earth's. It nears Earth as it begins to orbit the sun again this time much warmer and hotter.

I also had Earth, one way or another, to be affected and moved about a few million km away from the sun. Does anyone know the effect this would have?

space,"Just a little thought experiment.. 

Let's say two earths with life so far away that if you look at it you'll see 1000 years in the past. If both were to look at eachother and broadcast what they see on a screen, you would create a loop in which you can see into the past until you see the first entity to start broadcasting their sightings.

You would see approx..:

* The others 1000 years back
* Yourself 2000 years back
* The others 3000 years back
* Yourself 4000 years back
* Etc...

If both us and another planet start broadcasting what we see right now (1000 light years away), people living 1 million years from now could see their own past from right this moment.

I don't know how much planets move relative to eachother, so this could all be bogus. Am I thinking straight?",Thought experiment observing the past

space,"Hi! This post is an idea I had and also asking for more info about dark energy / tell me why this idea is dumb! Thanks!

**Dark matter** is stuff forming into clumps over time, creating a scaffolding for matter, a grand web like structure on a macro scale across the universe.

Dark matter macro web structures are formed by the dark matter's gravitational property, clumping into dense regions and leaving voids in between the structure over time. 

Presumably the structure is a web and not a sphere because the universe has been expanding outward since the big bang, and the directionality of the blast energy causes a web shape to form as gravity takes over.

""**Dark energy**"" seems to be a term that means, ""things we can see speeding up and moving away from each other faster and faster."" 73% of the universe is made of this somehow.

I had the idea what if dark energy is just dark matter moving around? As the macro web structure forms and leaves voids, the dark matter coming into the common gravitational area of the web-strand from the void might pick up speed and crash into the grouping of dark matter at the strand, looking for it's space in the center of gravity and causing the strand to stretch.

If the dark matter keeps coming in from every direction to form a stronger gravitational strand, wouldn't that push the galaxies that we can ""see"" farther apart as more dark matter joins in the web-strand from the voids between? Assuming a somewhat initial even distribution of dark matter to begin with. The scaffolding is growing as more dark matter joins the web.

Because dark matter would be joining the strands from every direction, leaving more voids in between other strands, it might give the appearance that the galaxies are expanding away from each other, but in fact, the dark matter webs are just growing from any remaining dark matter coming in from all directions.

The stuff we can see would appear to be moving farther apart as the dark matter strands grow at almost every point in the strand from incoming dark matter. The existing dark matter around any galaxy acts as a lattice to hold the matter and the galaxies in place. The stuff we can see would be taken along for a ride as the rest of the strand grows and the voids between strands grow emptier.

If this is true, then eventually there could be a period of universe evolution where the increasing expansion of space starts to slow again, as any substantial amount of dark matter from the voids between the strands would have already joined its local strand. The strands would settle as dark matter finds its place and possibly stop expanding. The direction of big bang blast force would be the only force to keep expanding, and maybe gravity/ dark matter could take over from ""dark energy"" again eventually.

So in short, what if dark matter is clumping up so much its causing things to move apart from one another, and that is what dark energy is?

This thought is inspired by the 9 billion year mark where dark energy supposedly took over from dark matter.

space,"So for this discussion let's assume that the heat death model for the future of our universe holds true and let's also assume that cosmic inflation keeps accelerating like we have observed.

So we know that the universe is pretty young right now. Many stars have lifespans in the trillions of years and we are only not even 14 billion years old. Yet we still already see black holes like TON 618 which are billions of solar masses and many times the size of our entire solar system.

So by the time we get to the point in heat death where the only thing on the universe is black holes, I'm sure they will be unbelievably massive after trillions of years of absorbing stuff and mergers. (As an aside what would it be like if two TON 618 size black holes merged? The gravitational waves generated must be ungodly to imagine...).

Since the rate of expansion Is also accelerating, what we will have is massive mega black holes maybe even as big as a fraction of a light year in size, and the universe will be ripping it apart from the inside.

So now for my questions. 

1. Does the rate of expansion of the universe also hold true for the space inside of the event horizon of a black hole?

2. Could the size of the black hole be increased (even slightly) due to inflation pulling it apart faster than its losing mass due to hawking radiation?

3. The time is takes for these size black holes to evaporate is 10^ungodly amount of years. Could it reach a point where inflation pulls it apart faster than it looses mass? Especially if the rate of expansion continues to accelerate?

4. Is it even possible to pull apart a black hole like that? If so, what would it look like as that happened and what effect would it have on the mass/size. If not, what effects if any does inflation have on massive black holes during the quadrillions of years that the black hole slowly evaporates.

Thanks for considering my discussion",Effects of eternal inflation on mega black holes near the end of the universe

I have a few questions about getting into astrophotography.  Currently I have a Canon Rebel T6, a cheaper telescope (I'm not sure exactly what it is but I know it's not ""top-quality"" one), and a T-Mount for my camera and telescope.  I know my way around the camera and how all the settings work together. My goal is to get atleast decent quality pictures of stars, galaxies, planets, and other objects. 

Here are the questions:

1. Is this goal possible with my current setup or will I be dissapointed?
2. Is there anything else that I may be overlooking that i sould get?
3. When someone says ""12 hour exposure time"" what exactly does that mean? It can't be a constant 12 hours of the cameras shutter being open, right?
4. What is the general process of this? How much planning goes into getting a picture of, say the Andromeda Galaxy?

I think that's all my questions for now.

space,Hi guys I would just really like a answer here if that’s cool I have been thinking of the concept of light speed for a short while and I just wonder if it’s actually possible because I’ve been reading up on our planets current situation and what could happen down the road and what we know will happen that alpha centouri B is possibly one of our last chances but the fact of the matter is even with voyager it would take 73 thousand years give or take to make the journey. And we’d still need to use some sort of cryosleep system to survive that long. But according to NASA with light speed we could make it in roughly 4 years so if anyone has an answer to lightspeed would be greatly appreciated thx guys🙏🏻😇,Light speed?

I've done the math

To raise the temperature of Europa to 15 Celcius, 450 giga tonnes of nitrous oxide is required ( a simple molecule to manufacture using in situ ammonium salts and oxygen in ice ), the total energy debt would be settled by about 10% of the world's energy production for 26 days.

 Io, a nearby moon can supply this very simply using a literal lighting pole at its pole which would then conduct the flux tube of Jupiter and io generating 2 terrajoules a second in electrical current, this could be beamed to europa using a microwave antenna and a rectifier with a conversion efficiency rate of 20-80% ( 4 months worst case scenario to settle energy debt). this would raise the average temp of Europa to ~15 Celsius causing the ice crust to begin to melt. 

Europa's ice is chockablock filled with oxygen caused by billions of years of radiolytic water decay, in fact each cubic meter of ice melted is 1.7-7.5% trapped oxygen trapped in clathrate by mass, meaning just the top 300 meters of ice crust would release at the lowest estimate 5100kg's of oxygen per square meter. 

Given the lower gravity of Europa 7.46x weaker than earth, thats 0.068 bars of pressure which is above the Armstrong limit of 0.061 bars ( point your blood boils), and thats with the MINIMUM pressure of just the top 300 meters, the pressure could be as high as 0.3 bars of oxygen in a 7.4% oxygen scenario WHICH IS BREATHABLE.

Within a decade or 2, the top kilometre should have thawed at which point the atmosphere would definitely be breathable even at minimum oxygen content.

p.s. it would take 3000 ish years for just the atmosphere from the top 300 meters of ice melt to be blown away based on the MINIMUM pressure, the full oxygen inventory of the crust would last hundreds of thousands of years not even including accumulation of oxygen caused by water decay in the upper atmosphere ( Europa has more than enough water for tens of MILLIONS of years)",Europa could be terraformed in 20 years

Bissell, Ph.D., distinguished senior scientist (the highest rank bestowed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)/DOE) in the Biological Systems and Engineering Division, to its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Dr. Bissell was previously head of the Biosciences division of LNBL for 14 years along with being the chair of the 200+ page report for the NASA Space Radiation Health Program study related to a mission to Mars.

Dr. Bissell is one of five recipients of the 2020 Canada Gairdner International Award, an annual honor given to scientists who have contributed to transformative human health research. She is Faculty of four Graduate Groups in UC Berkeley: Comparative Biochemistry, Endocrinology, Molecular Toxicology, and Bioengineering (UCSF/UCB joint program). She has challenged several established paradigms, and pioneered the field of tumor microenvironment. Using mammary gland and breast cancer her body of work has provided the foundation for the current recognition of the pivotal role that extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling plays in regulation of gene expression in both normal and malignant cells. Her laboratory pioneered the use of 3D organoids and techniques that allowed her to prove her signature phrase that after conception, ""phenotype is dominant over genotype.""

Vectorspace AI specializes in detecting hidden relationships in data via advanced networks of data engineering pipelines designed to generate datasets and visualizations applied to space biosciences and is a long time collaborator with the Bissell Lab at LBNL under U.S. government contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 along with the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) division.

I was watching  strange Bright star next to Moon. First day, i noticed it only because it was blinking a lot so i took a look. It looked like a planet, but if it would be, it would probablly be Jupiter or Saturn. But i did not Saw any Moon so it wasn't any of it. It was Brown so Mars was out too. Next day, when the star showed again, i started looking again and something large black Has passed by it. It had shape like Jupiter's Moon Haumea (the one that looks like Egg) but it couldnt be Moon, because it Has STOPPED ať the MIDDLE of the ""star"". Later on today, it wasn't cloudu so i started watching again and noticed it changed its color to blue, and than it DISSAPEARED and showed Up after like 2-3 hours. I am Very confused about that what it could be. Do you have any Guess what it could be? I am Once again sure that nothing was blocking my view or it wasn't cloudy.",Question

I asked about Titan, thankfully, you guys answered and i've seen that it's not as good as i thought.

## [Şimdi sen kalkıp gidiyorsun](http://www.lokmandemir.com.tr/tag/cemal-sureya-simdi-sen-kalkip-gidiyorsun/). Git.Gözlerin durur mu onlar da gidiyorlar. Gitsinler.Oysa ben senin gözlerinsiz edemem bilirsinOysa Allah bilir bugün iyi uyanmıştıkSevgiyeydi ilk açılışı gözlerimizin sırf onaydıBir kuş konmuş parmaklarıma uzun uzun ötmüştüBir sevişmek gelmiş bir daha gitmemiştiYoktu dünlerde evvelsi günlerdeki yoksulluğumuzSanki hiç olmamıştı

## Oysa kalbim işte şuracıkta çarpıyorduŞurda senin gözlerindeki bakımsız mavi, güzel laflı İstanbullarŞurda da etin çoğalıyordu dokundukça lafların dünyalarınÖyle düzeltici öyle yerine getiriciydi sevmekKi Karakoy köprüsüne yağmur yağarkenBıraksalar gökyüzü kendini ikiye bölecektiÇünkü iki kişiydik

## Oysa bir bardak su yetiyordu saçlarını ıslatmayaBir dilim ekmeğin bir iki zeytinin başınaydı doymamızSeni bir kere öpsem ikinin hatırı kalıyorduİki kere öpeyim desem üçün boynu bükükYüzünün bitip vücudunun başladığı yerdeMemelerin vardı memelerin kahramandı sonraSonrası iyilik güzellik.
