Here is one of the biggest red pills and rabbit holes on the Internet. Strap yourselves in. There are hours of video, radiology, HD scans, DNA tests, carbon dating and expert testimony. This is a deep dive. I recommend looking at the 3D scans then watching one or two of the videos first. The videos all have subtitles available.

Scroll to the bottom and check out the HD scans. Then watch some videos. The only question is are they indigenous or from elsewhere. There is no chance at all this is a hoax IMO.

EDIT: thanks for the love and the awards. Please help me to spread this. This is a fascinating and mindblowing revelation. It also makes people start to question the MSM and the government. They start to think “hmmm, why haven’t I heard about this? What else are they lying about?”",Definitely not a hoax. Alien or inner Earth?

This is a really good episode. I keep coming back to it, because he hasn't talked yet to the Gov't people and is free about what he says.  In this episode he is much more candid talking about the breakaway civilization, the secret space program,  and structures on the moon.  Also talks a lot about Joseph Farrell, while his theories are crazy, are backed up by legitimate research he can cite to actual documents.  


Some quotes I liked:   
""I remember being a party and someone whispered in my ear that worked at one of these big defense contractors that 'hey we've been mining on the moon for 30 years'""  


""If there is a secret about this stuff, there is a good reason, it's either these guys are so scared of something that they haven't been able to do what they needed to do or they don't have all the facts yet and they're not ready to release it.""   


""Joseph Farrell believes this is, there are three pieces of this, ya know, it's like a triangle.... He believes that there is a UFO Phenomenon that we're really scared of and we're trying to play catch up to, he also believes there's an extra nation state that has this technology that were the guys that basically crashed near Roswell and maybe a few other places and are remnants of Nazi Germany and they could be anywhere or maybe they're from Russia or this or that. But what we do know is that they have the technology too and they're flying over our skies in low earth orbit. The third thing is it's like a large psychological operation where we are either trying to hide what we know from the phenomenon itself or we're trying to hide what we know from this extra nation state. So it's partly psychological cause they don't want to come out with these secrets cause we're trying to make it seem like we have a lot more at our disposal than we actually do, but we don't.""

This thing was really big n orange, it looked like a planet.

I keep driving to where it's at and then when we finally do find it it's gone. I looks like the regular moon. But this Moon is really small again and white, it was a full moon but it wasn't what we just saw I don't know if there's an explanation if anybody knows like maybe something reflected off of something in the sky I don't know this thing was big it wasn't the Sun and honestly I don't believe it to be the Moon.",Explination?

We started driving again, at my friend's request, and the object flew and blinked faster in our direction. While the moon kept up perfectly with the car, the object fell behind and came forward several times. It eventually fell too far behind and I couldn't see it anymore. 

I always try to be as skeptical as I can about these sorts of things. I don't encounter a whole lot of shared experiences I don't understand.

aliens," had a training experience with Golden Triangle Head beings last night (well, it's a copy paste so 2-3 days or more ago)  
somebody on FB told me to tell them to remember everything upon waking up, and i sure did, holy crap  


 they are golden skin triangle head aliens of 3 feet tall in soul forms   
 they wore golden robes, they had a golden aura full f kindness and gentleness it's something so special, it's very hard to describe   
(they're connected to the love of the universe)  
 they are immensely benevolent, they never disrespect you, treat you with kindness and make you understand a lot of things  
Like that people had things to learn in theirs lives and you can't interrupt people making mistakes they have to learn from  


Where i was, was in a tall transparent crystal tower with spiral stairs and there were rooms where people were trained  
The tall golden teacher, there were 3 of them, they are very tall (double or triple our height, wore golden robes, were of pure soul energy and looked at screens and stuff)  
one showed me the aura of evil and it was the most suffocating thing i have ever experienced (basically the evil of the iluminati and stuff)  
i never called for help so fast in my life, it was suffocating, i felt like i was torn apart and losing my mind  
and just like that, i didn't feel it anymore, like i was a golden bubble  
 theirs eyes were multicolor, like the rainbow, and they exuded a very strong aura of love  
try to ask to remember everything when you wake up (respectfully and gently)  
maybe you're being trained too  
i constantly have memories of dreams of having powers and using them and using technology hyper advanced like things write themselves if you cast your hand/thoughts on it, flying (it's very hard), making orbs in my hands, creating fire, transforming to animals, being animal, ect  
it's kind of  tiring thought  
it's only 1 hour of your sleep that hey train you   
Thee powers i get in dreams   
 i can create  swirling balls in my hands, make fire, make sphere of love/healing (same shit) everyone is dressed in blue uniforms in a translucent crystal tower with spiral stairs the tower have multiple rooms where people train theirs powers, each floor has a different mastery level  everyone there are as souls, everyone has their body asleep we can communicate with thoughts &amp; auras   


  


we were all invited as a souls  
they call it dream training   
we will all going to see them when the earth will go to 5D in our dreams (probably)  
they're really nice, as soul they have golden robes, golden energy &amp; auras and have multicolor eyes  
they speak in their auras/telepathic (they face you and send theirs thoughts to you, the tech they use is telepathic (think and it writes),   
The 5D thing is the great awakening (Q post &amp; Q The Great Awakening map)

It's sheduled to happen ""soon""  
maybe this year or next year  
It's very hard to understand what these guys think as ""soon"" and a few months/moments while they told me they can live up to 10 000 years in their soul form (they have transcended the need for bodies)  
Their kids are on their planet at home being schooled for a long long time to be great people (compassionate, loving and balanced persons)  
When go past adolescence and adulthood and are deemed good enough as person, they then start their journey of teaching other lifeforms to be better people, use powers and ect

  


If you think you're being trained by them, (feeling of constantly using no earth tech, earth tech being super cumbersome (ex: you feel  you use tech that thing write themsleves instead of having to type every word, feeling of using powers and stuff maybe you're being trained too and before you sleep, remember to ask to remember everything once you wake up,   


if nothing get remembered for 2-3 days it's okay, you were just not chosen, your turn will happen eventually (aliens of all races WILL come to earth, no question about it)  
Everyone will get to meet them and learn from them  


&amp;#x200B;

there a ""lots"" of people who are being trained every night, they all wear blue uniform , have different mastery levels and time they come in  


about the powers we use, each floor has it own room with it's focus  
 each floor:   
1st feel the energy  (meditation, simple sensing)  
2nd exit it and shape it    
3rd create fire, swirling balls, water, ect    


4th  use the energy as body extension like extra arms, wings, tentacles (to get a hold of stuff and grab stuff far away) even use the energy as purifying beads    


5th  actually heal (very hard, i'm not even close to that yet, it's extremely dangerous if done improperly)  we use tech that interface with the soul   


The way we can use the powers is 100% the same as the tai-chi, avatar last airbender thing and doctor strange astral thing  
Great things can be found in ancient art and way of living (tai chi, fuon gong, ect), they are the best gateway learning processes 

  
The tech we use there:  
ex: a translucent screen that you put your hand on it and your idea is drawing from your mind  
basically better flat screen stuff

A holographic watch that has a clock, but with shitload of rotating menus and other meters of stuff (energy, solar energy, tiredness, negativity, purity, ect  
It's a ""regular"" watch until you touch the screen on it and the screen image go up and expand to other menus and circular meters

Like this

relax in it, (basically sleep for the soul)

Most UFO cases, feel this way, they leave behind little physical evidence, and if they do, it's usually just a scrap of metal. This idea is similar to Vallee and the control system, but with a playful bent, if not maybe a little malicious.

So, let's frame this post correctly; there is a LOT of 'witness recorded' UFO footage out there in YouTube, Vimeo, Tik-Tok etc.

A large percentage of the footage is wobbly, poorly focused, filmed vertically on a smart-phone, or just looks like it was shot on an old betamax camcorder !!

So, we are a team of UFO fanatical content creators, and one of our members is a retired crime-scene video forensics specialist who uses dTective video forensics software, as well as other professional apps and plug-ins to tease out the unseen details in videos.

Once a week, we would like to feature a 'suggested' piece of video footage that hasn't really been given the attention it deserves which can be analyzed using the software.

**This is where YOU come in**. Either DM us here on Reddit, or email us at [offworldtribe@gmail.com](mailto:offworldtribe@gmail.com) \- or even contact us through our channel, with a link to a video you like us to examine. If you have footage to upload, let us know and we will send you access to our upload section in our Cloud server.

**We'd mention you for suggesting, and be so happy for your help in finding that footage, out there, that deserves to be looked at closely !!**

As a small example, because we only used still frame analysis, we have only made one such post so far, but it will give you the concept. This is it...

In this dream, it was a small group of ships left earth and finally arrive at our first alien planet outside our galaxy (in this dream, our technology advanced through reverse engineering of crashed and captured alien vessels).

In this dream, we arrive and land on this alien planet. Prior to landing, throughout the trip, and prior to leaving earth, there was heavy influence on diplomacy training, cultural competences, and respect of the new cultures. In a nutshell, everything mankind has down in our past from The Crusades, Spanish Conquistador arrivals in the Americas, and westward expansion in the United States (Manifest Destiny), don’t do that, do the opposite. We were trained that these people were more advanced than us through travel and one can safely assume their weapon technology is far more advanced.

Anyway, we land and make contact.  However, flash forward a couple days, our intergalactic-traveling brethren, soon realized they can possible colonize and control the new planet. 

Their attempt was quickly put down and the aggravators were imprisoned while those of us not involved were still welcomed.

The aliens then traveled back to earth and announced what took place to all the governments and organizations and what they were going to do next.

The aliens allowed the peaceful non-aggressors astronauts to select who they want to bring to the new planet, while earth descended into further conflict between super powers and ideologies. I had to choose who I wanted and didn’t want to bring amongst my family and friends.

For those of you who subscribe to coast to coast AM. (For those of you who don't subscribing for just a month to binge some old Art Bell Episodes and Tom Delonge's interviews is totally worth it)  The 3rd and 4th hour George Noory interviews John Rhodes a reptoid (reptillian) researcher.  His description of  what is going on is very on point with what Tom Delonge describes (In Sekret machines gods, it dives into the Reptillians, the greys, nordics, human like ones) and what a friend of mine who does remote viewing and has viewed underground Reptoid colonies underground. I think that his methods seem very good and his understanding of the entire subject of UFOs and crypto/extra terrestrials seems very probable. This, in my opinion, is much more believable than what Icke talks about.  He describes two players other than humans on earth and they don't like each other and how it relates to religious texts. He has a [cool website](http://www.reptoids.com/) that doesn't try to sell you prepping supplies and gold, so that's respectable.

While I don't believe in the God described by religions, I do think that there is a fair chance for a technological God to exist.

For example let's say an advanced civilisation got to evolve much earlier than any other, one that got to be here first and therefore got the longest time possible to develop without any interference, had all the materials it needs at it's disposal. 

That one would certainly have an advantage over any other that started to evolve after it. It could even insist on maintaining a form of hierarchy by preventing the rest from possessing the same weaponry. They might be responsible for setting intergalactic laws (if there is any)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ht4tyh)",Are you an alien?
aliens,"I'll start this off by saying I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm 18 and studying towards a masters degree in aerospace engineering at one of the worlds top universities.


Disclosure:
I'm also autistic so my logic may be perverse but I will try to describe it best I can, I am inviting open discussion regarding this topic and I will not subject anyone to my beliefs whom does not want to try to understand my view.
 
My argument will be built on probability and human philosophy.


LOGIC:

We know that this university is ~13.787±0.020B years old, this is not down for dispute, we have a rudimentary but plausible model for the creation of our universe, big bang, exponential expansion, protons and neutrons are formed, you've got hydrogen, now you have an interstellar medium, it gravitates to the largest cluster of mass, under it's own pressure you have nucular fusion in your first stars, very cool. Ultimately the universe cools, stars go super nova and create heavier elements, and now you have solar systems in your first galaxy's. 

The first stars formed ~200 Million years after the big bang, and the oldest known solar system, the HIP 11952 exoplanet system is approximately 12.8 Billion years old. Logically, on the assumption that this is miraculously the very first solar system it would have formed only ~1 Billion years after the big bang.

Using our galaxy, the milky way as a basis we can, to a reasonable level of accuracy presume that 150 billion stars are born per year in the entire Universe, that's 4800 stars per second. 

Now, once again using the near space as a model we can conclude that ultimately 1/2 of these systems have natural satellites (planets, dwarf planets), continuing this, and based on current projections roughly 1.4-2.7% of these lie in the circumstellar habitable zone, albeit a even lesser number of these planets will support the relevant building blocks for carbon based life like ourselves. 

However, it is not ignorant to make the assumption that in the ~12.8 billion years since some of the first solar systems formed, and of the ~70 billion trillion (7 x 1022) stars that we can observe, life may have developed, infact statistics, from a pessimists perspective this is almost a mathematical certainty.

In an attempt to rationalise the argument the drake equation, as seen below, or rather a modern approach to the question has been used to determine the number of civilisations within our own galaxy.


N = N* * FL * FHZ * FM * (L/T')

N is the number of civilizations we can communicate with

N* is the total number of stars within the galaxy

fL is the percentage of those stars that are at least 5 billion years old

fHZ is the percentage of those stars which host a suitable planet for supporting life

fM is the percentage of those stars with sufficient metallicity, allowing for advanced biology and an advanced civilisation.

L is the average lifetime of an advanced civilization

t' is the average amount of time available for life to develop

So, combined with our latest astrophysical data we may conclude there should be 36 alien civilisations within the milky way. 

Now what remains to reason is why we have not encountered alien life, now I do not believe that lizard people are among us, or that we are being systematically probed by green bobbleheaded aliens. 

However, this is simply a matter of philosophy rather then mathematics, and so from this point forward the rationalisation will be based upon my understandings.

Making the assumption that we have unfortunately not made contact with an alien race i must ask why, if there should have been aliens flying around for a couple of billion years then why haven't we met them yet, well I can only conclude a few explanations.


Either:

They do not exist- contrary to all I have said there is a possibility that alien life has simply never evolved, therefore we are indeed alone.

The Great filter- under the assumptions that aliens have evolved and have not contacted us we may assume there is an evolutionary hurdle in which life simply cannot, or rarely jumps, in this philosophy, encountering no alien life would indicate that we are either immensely lucky, or doomed for extinction.

Now I will acknowledge an infinite number of possibilities but I believe these to be the most logical.

My opinion is that we are simply at such a great distance they cannot reach us.
Light acts as both a particle and a wave, travelling at 299,792,458 m / s, and therefore, the light we see is merely a ghost image, it takes light ~499seconds to reach us from our sun and therefore some of the most distant stars we see may be just be a ghost from stars billions of years long gone, on the same prospect, the barren solar systems that we see may now be thriving with life, it may have evolved before the earliest light even reached us, infact on the basis that we are not indeed alone it would not be perverse to say that we may witness the rise and fall of great civilisations billions of years long extinct. And once again, on that very premise, life most definitely does exist, and many species will watch our planet, or rather the light that we are reflecting for billions of years after our race does inevitably destroy itsself.

Thus, in conclusion, I believe that life does exist, however the constraints of the physical universe limit us, and unless our reality can be replaced by another I do not believe that we will ever make contact with another race, more so that we will observe and be observed long into the future.


Once again I invite dignified discussion.","My consensus on alien life, please add your own views and opinions."

The guys were all sitting around the campfire drinking and this new guy is pretty drunk and starts pointing out stars and saying things like ""the greys are from this planet"" and then he would name another type of alien and describe the planet they live on, getting into details about the wars and history and such. This went on for a while and the guys started joking around about aliens, bigfoot, etc. Well, the new guy decided to go to sleep because he was tired and he left the campfire. 

My Dad said they were all laughing like ""That guy is pretty out there, maybe a little crazy"" and the guy that brought the new guy was like ""Yeah, he's really interesting - he's also worked for NASA for the past 40 years.""

Dad said everyone got really quiet and were pretty shocked, they just thought the man was drunk and stuff but anyway they all decided it was definitely time to go to sleep and didn't discuss it any further.

I was like ""Dad, why didn't you get his info so you could talk to him more about it?""

It was the evening of the summer of 2013, I was travelling back to my home, there was a sunset in front of me. I was actually in a car, I was watching the sunset then suddenly I noticed a black spot in front of the sun. I thought maybe it would be a stain in my car's glass but when I got out of the car, it was still there. I don't know what it was, it looked like a planet in front of the sun but how can a planet be seen by a naked eye in front of the sun without any telescope or binoculars? It was not only me who noticed it, others in the car also noticed it. I still haven't come to a conclusion what that thing actually was because I have never seen such a thing after that.

The second time I saw Unidentified Objects was when the powerful earthquakes struck Nepal in 2015. I am actually a citizen of India. So my part was also struck hard from that earthquake. So here's my story, before the earthquakes actually occurred, the sky was red in the evening the early day, when its shockwaves occur second time, there was heavy rain a day before, the next day the sky was clear. We were without electricity at that time. I noticed that the sky was very clear, I mean very clear that you can see many stars than you usually see in the sky with clouds. So when I was gazing the sky, two things were constantly appearing, aeroplane in the sky carrying the victims of the earthquake from nepal to india for medication as well some helicopters. But a star was actually moving the the sky, at first I thought it was a shooting star, but then a second star like object behind it also began to move. I know it was moving in a zigzag pattern faster than a plane. I know you all will be thinking that all these stories are made by me. But believe me the 2015 one was actually real, it was not space station but the movement was very fast with a zig zag pattern. Because of lack of electricity, our phones got discharged and so we were not able to capture it. The thing is, they were appearing like dots similar to night sky stars and were moving very fast.","I have saw UFO two times in my lifetime. It's not a fake story, believe me."

aliens,"I was talking to a dear friend of mine, about a memory that I felt I had kind of blocked out. It's a very brief experience but nevertheless, it's been haunting me lately

I remember waking up one evening, in my bed. I was a child of about 9 or 10. 

There were these being around my bed. They were dressed in all black. They were really pale things. And extremely quiet. I heard no words from them at all.

I was terrified and tried to scream but absolutely nothing came out of my mouth. It was like I could only scream internally. 

I couldn't move my hands more my legs. 

The funny thing about it is, I can't describe their faces. It's like a blur. I can remember one seemed like it was female. They actually didn't look anything like aliens as we see them in pop culture but they looked like something I can't even describe. They were just pale as I can remember. Not even ""white"" or Caucasian.

They moved their heads around to each other's if to be communicating but there were no words. None from me, none from them. Silence was pierced by the sound of raindrops. 

I'm not the kind of guy that will just scream ""ALIENS!"" as the first speculative thought enters my mind about it. It could have been a dream, or a wild imagination. 

But after that experience, I noticed another incident outside my room shortly after. Maybe a few days after.

A cluster of colors by my door, floating, piercing light as if there were diamonds in it. I could sense it was, something, aware. Not human. Not like anything I've seen. I got an extremely disturbing vibe from it, if I could describe it intuitively, I would say it felt like insanity, and truth. 

Like I said, I recalled these memories whilst chilling with my homegirl. I would love to hear from anyone with similar experiences or more knowledgeable about this than I am. Would love to do some research",Child-Hood Experience. Please Read And Help With Any Knowledge You Can Provide

aliens,"This is long, but I like to be detailed.

I was about 5 or 6 when I had the earliest nightmare that I can clearly remember, one that happened to be about an alien invasion.

In the dream, I'm sitting in our living room with my older brother. My dad is in the shower, and I know this because I can hear the water running and the door is closed. 

Yet, something pretending to be my ""dad"" walks into the living room and sits in his chair. Even though he looks like a perfect clone of my dad and is wearing his clothes, I know this thing isn't my dad because one, my real dad is still taking a shower, and because the fake one has this hauntingly wide smile on his face.

The fake dad then pulls out a stereotypical looking laser gun, and kills my brother with it. At this point I'm freaking out and screaming, and while I'm doing that, the fake dad, with that awful smile still on his face, slowwwly points to the living room window. I crawl up on the couch and look out the window to see giant and terrifyingly beautiful circular-like alien spaceships and flying saucers flying around, vaporizing everything in their path with lasers, explosions and flames everywhere. 

Like I'm watching a movie, it cuts to black.

Then, a single beam of light comes down to reveal a short, green alien on a metal disk. It's pudgy, with two antenna like eyes protruding out of its head. The plate slowly begins to spin, and the alien begins to scream and beg for mercy. Out of the darkness on all sides, a vast array of knives, swords, saws, drills, and other sharp objects slowly come towards the alien. As the plates still slowly spinning, blood comes gushing out of its wounds as everything cuts in to him, and it's screaming in agony.

Then I woke up.

Obviously, this was a bit traumatizing for a 5/6 year old, and it stayed with me for quite a long time. As far as I and my parents know, I had never really been introduced to the concept of aliens before that dream, much less something as horrifically violent as that. I wasn't into TV at that age anyways. My mom thinks real aliens sent me a ""message"" and that I received it, but I'm a bit skeptical of that. Maybe I saw aliens in a book or something somewhere, who knows. Either way, it would make for a great short story.",Had A Dream About Aliens Before I Knew What They Were

aliens,"The Gundam franchise is really just about sublimating the male fantasies of catfights and cross-dressing by designing the mobile weapons to look like different schoolgirl/girlscout uniforms, and not only that but uniforms from actual schools etc., and then pitting them against each other in high-tech mortal combat.

&amp;#x200B;

The way this is done is by Yoshiyuki Tomino visiting girl schools etc. in disguise, usually as a fireman, he then lowers their guard with goofy theatrics and subliminally gains the conscious and subconscious approval of these girls through manipulation of male archetypes, and then uses this special rapport to subtly control the schoolgirls/girlscouts etc. to function as the pawns from which his art derives its substance.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also the real drive behind the contemporary sensationalised paedophilia, paedophiles who perv around schools have somehow received incomplete, faulty or weaponised subliminal mecha franchise programming and are subconsciously attracted to the allure of Japanese mecha in its aspect of schoolgirl/girlscout uniforms, whilst consciously believing that it is those kiddies they are hot for, when it's really just their uniforms that are driving them wild.",Gundam Franchise Conspiracy Theory

aliens,"There's no doubt that Tom Delonge's organization, To The Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, has dramatically advanced the topic of UFOs. This is irrefutable. Now, unlike ever before, the subject is moving towards becoming an accepted ""mainstream"" topic. Nevertheless, despite the high level of praise they deserve, they should equally be called out for refusing openly oppose the diabolical, rogue Special Access Programs and other organizations that have perpetuated the concealment of extraterrestrial visitation of our planet and exotic reverse engineered technologies. Their decision to acquiesce to the desires of those parties who have bound humanity in chains of ignorance is nothing less than a form of collusion. Although most likely acting out of the self interest to avoid retribution and to protect their admittedly hard-earned clearances, their unwillingness to directly and vocally confront those at the heart of the UFO cover up is unacceptable. 

The human civilization on this planet is facing countless challenges. Hunger, poverty, natural disasters, famine, pandemics, pollution, environmental destruction, resource scarcity: these are only a few of the issues that impart heart wrenching suffering on millions or even billions of people. With a growing global population, all these problems are exaccerbated. If throw in all the possible ""black swan"" events - solar flares, asteroids, volcanic eruptions - that could occur at any given moment, the future seems bleak. But what if there was a revelation that could bring the world not only hope but information and god-like technologies to combat all these issues? Such an an answer exists and has been available ever since the first crash recoveries of the nineteen forties; shamefully, indisputable physical proof of the visitation of our planet by extraterrestrials in vehicles that manipulate the most fundamental forces of our universe (mass, inertia, and gravity) has been locked up and sequestered away ever since it was acquired. Since then, not only the citizens of the world have been denied this fundamental knowlege but also the vast bulk of elected officials, office holders, top scientists, and military leadership. Every human being on the planet had a right to know and not be intentionally deceived and lied to, which is bad enough. But for the prominent decision makers of our democratically elected governments, with an even greater need to know, to have been kept out of the loop an horrendous grievance. This constitutes nothing short of treason. 
Individuals like Dr. Harold Puthoff, Dr. Christopher Kit Green, Dr. Eric Davis, Luis Elizondo, and several others within the network that surrounds TTSA deserve our respect and gratitude for making numerous sacrifices and even dedicating large segments of their lives to uncovering the truth about the UFO phenomena and related issues - including exotic propulsion technologies, consciousness phenomena, and new energy solutions. They are not a collection of intelligence community operatives all working together in some sort of deranged plot to mislead the UFO community to ""weaponize space"", as a few misguided detractors frequently and falsely assert at every opportunity. They are real people. They are real researchers. They are individuals with a real interest in this field. To deny this is irrational and illogical. Yet, at the same time there are aspects of their collective mentality that should be questioned. At the top of this list is the simple fact they refuse to actively confront and oppose the Special Access Programs and other organizations that established, perpetuated, and continue to maintain the ""truth embargo."" 

An excellent example of how they continually display their propensity to bow down to the Special Access Programs is how they have responded to the leak of the Admiral Thomas Wilson document. This set of extremely detailed notes from an actual ""real"" discussion between Dr. Eric Davis and Admiral Wilson constitutes an exceptional piece of evidence that could be used to accelerate disclosure. The information it contains points to illegal collusion between members of the leadership team of the Senior Review Group of the overall Special Access Program Oversight Committee and private corporations recieving DoD funding to hide the existence of UFO related reverse engineering projects. All of this activity was illicit by definition. Instead of obeying the law and openly reporting to the oversight bodies that govern all Special Access Programs, they made a private deal that allowed them to continue falsifying information while recieving constant financial support. Moreover, they used their immense power to have the Chairman of the Senior Review Group threaten the whistleblower hero (who exposed their existence and illegality) with a reduction of rank, a loss of his pension, and further damage to his career. This was a CRIMINAL act on both the part of the leadership of the Senior Review Group and the leaders of the Special Access Program. 
Overall, the entire document is nothing short of a bombshell - the type of evidence the UFO community has been dreaming of obtaining: a confirmation of crashed recoveries of non-human vehicles, a confirmation of Special Access Programs working on the reverse engineering of the technology, and a confirmation of the collusion between these programs and certain individuals within the Department of Defense. Yet when this document leaked the aforementioned individuals (Dr. Harold Puthoff and many of his associations including Dr. Eric Davis himself) wouldn't confirm the veracity of the document in clear, unambiguous language. They repeatedly provided convoluted statements to UFO researchers like Richard Dolan. While not denials by any means, they were evasive enough to fuel continued doubt among certain pseudo-skeptical groups who went on to sow discord in the community. The excuse for not sharing more information so as to establish the reality of the document was simple but at the same time pathetic: since it likely contained classified information they could not comment. 

Individually and collectively, the membership of To the Stars Academy has made it clear they will not oppose these Special Access Programs and their operations. Their lack of detailed comment on the Adm. Thomas Wilson document is only one example. Another one is Eric Davis lack of willingness to openly share details about his experience being at least partially ""read in"" to a Special Access Program working on reverse engineering. Yes, in an interview Eric Davis has admitted to having such a briefing in a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility). Perhaps another is Lue Elizondo's unwillingness to go into detail about the multitude of UFO encounters that AATIP investigated during his tenor as director. And, of course, there is Tom Delonge's refusal to talk about the same subject matter he discussed before his key insiders, Gen. William McCasland and Robert F. Weiss of Lockheed were ""outed"" by Wikileaks. Before they were exposed, he would openly speak about how there were indeed not one but a series of crash recoveries, how we already cracked gravity, and that vehicles such as the TR3B had been built. Now, he won't go there - as if he thinks his previous claims will somehow fade away. There are likely many more examples of this mentality among the TTSA membership, but they all have one key feature in common: their unwillingness to expose the illegal, rogue programs that continue to deny humanity the knowledge and absolute evidence of extraterrestrial visitation of our planet. 

The treasure trove of information in their collective possession could go far towards exposing the UFO/ET cover up once and for all. Yet they remain mostly silent and refuse to utilize the tools at their disposal to expose, disrupt, and bring about a end to these programs - so they can be re-established under the control of our democratically elected representatives. Some of the reasons for their refusal to oppose them are obvious: not wanting to threaten their security clearances, not wanting to experience the repercussions of crossing such established programs, and the desire to stay on their ""good side"" in the hope of one day getting full access for themselves. Also, it's possible that some of them, due to their previous careers in different government agencies, may view leaking classified information - even of blatantly illegal programs that are operating in a manner contrary to the ideals of our democracy - as unpatriotic or treasonous. Conversely, I think that NOT opposing these programs and exposing their existence is what they should realize is unpatriotic. Inaction against these parasitic SAPs that hide fundamental truths from the world, conceal themselves from oversight bodies, hold back critical knowledge from decision makers, and leech billions of dollars from taxpayers (while providing nothing back but lies and disinformation) is what I would consider worthy of being called treason. 

Those that have knowledge of these projects and groups must share what they know with the world. No delays, no redactions, no excuses. Every day that the this network of demons are allowed to conceal the truth about the UFO reality more damage is done, costing progress and lives. Full and complete disclosure of the history of the visitation of our planet - including crash recoveries and successful reverse engineering - is more important than any one individual's self interests. Even if the sharing of such information comes with a risk, those involved with TTSA should remember that untold thousands of American soldiers have been sent off to fight in wars, which accomplished little to nothing, with the result being their deaths or permanent disability. If members of the military can be expected to make such sacrifices for virtually nothing in many cases, then wouldn't even the most severe consequence of confronting and exposing the Special Access Programs be worth it considering the implications of ending the UFO cover up and the amazing new world that would result? I would say without a doubt, yes. And such individuals who summoned up the courage to do so would be the ultimate heroes, not traitors or oathbreakers. They would be remembered for all time as brave souls who bucked the system and took the actions that were required to bust apart the programs that kept humanity in slavery: deaf, blind, and dumb to the greater reality all around them. 

We must all call for TTSA and their membership to change their position on directly opposing the Special Access Programs and other powers that have maintained the cover up. This would consist of them openly sharing all their evidence that could help expose the existence of these programs, shifting focus from UFO sightings by pilots to the actual hard reality of crash recoveries, a review of the Adm. Thomas Wilson document as a main feature of the next season of Unidentified, and a new mandate to identify and expose the programs that have perpetuated the 80 year campaign of lies about this phenomena.",Acquiescing To Diablo: To The Stars Academy's Obedient Submission To The Special Access Programs

My first post on the sub. As you've probably guessed from the title of this post, I'm not exactly ""well-read"" in terms of UFO books. I've read and very much enjoyed John Keel's *Mothman Prophecies* and Colm Kelleher's *Hunt for the Skinwalker* and I thought members of this community could hint me at some similar reads.

What I especially liked about both books are 1) the anecdotes (or rather how the events were described almost as in tales) and 2) their almost *true crime* structures.

As you can see, I'm not really into the science behind the phenomena or the theoretical aspects of them but more into the story. A friend of mine told me to give Jacques Vallée a chance and I will, but from what I understand, that might be a bit more philosophical than what I'm looking for. Am I wrong?

There are 22 main species of aliens known to integrate with humans all ranging in intelligence and hostility. The basque region in spain is 80-90% rh- blood type so its a hybrid region.

aliens,"So, an early disclaimer, this happened to me about a year ago, around Feb or March of 2019. I'm not sure if this is a paranormal occurrence or an alien(?)-related experience but I'd just type it either way since I wanna kill time atm. I'm not used to writing up a narrative so this might be wordy and lengthy. It might sound like a sleep paralysis at halfway, but please do read until the end because it is not. If you're too bored to read everything just read the last few paragraphs.

So this happened to me at home, I always have slept on the sofa with my dad in our living room since our house is pretty big but there's only the two of us, it gets lonely if we dont sleep together there. My sisters used to live here with us and some house helpers, but they had their own homes now and we dont have househelp anymore since its just the two of us.

So here's the story. It was a Saturday, I slept early the night before so I awoke at around 3AM. Played on my PC for a while then fell sleepy again after around an hour. At that time, I went back to bed (or my side of the sofa actually) and went to sleep. My dad was awake by then and was about to take a shower and visit my mom's grave. 

So before I knew I it, I actually fell asleep! Then I had a dream which I all still remember, I was walking around some flooded place with my real life friends. We were hopping above some stone chairs in some kind of park to avoid the flood water (In real life, we do a lot of travels, island hopping, snorkeling and the like, so this dream isnt too weird) 

Then this is where it starts to get weird. From hopping around in that dream, I suddenly ""WOKE UP"" from that dream. I was suddenly in the second floor of our house, in one of the big bedrooms and it was dark. Like pitch black darkness.  At the same time, I began to feel like somehow my consciousness or my control of my body is like being sucked out off me starting from my head? (like imagine IF there was a soul, its like its being sucked out of you from your head so its like you're slowly losing control of your body ***as if someone is pulling you from through your head***). Anyway, that feeling and the darkness scared me! 

I ran downstairs to the living room and tried opening the lights since it was still pitch darkness in there. The switches didnt work so I panicked, and tried to run outside. Suddenly in our kitchen it was bright, like morning in contrast to the absolute darkness of the rest of the house. 

I kept running and went to the garage/front yard. We live in gated houses here. And near my house's gate I saw two bright figures talking. One was inside the house and one was outside. 

I screamed at them and told them that I was losing control of my body! 

Then suddenly, I woke up, for real this time, and opened my eyes instantaneously.

THIS IS THE CREEPY/WEIRD PART. When I woke up, I was facing the stairs leading to the 2nd floor. I was still on the sofa. There was a silver/white/bright fence-like shape object coming from me just slightly above my head. It was going towards the stairs.  It looked like this and it was horizontal/laid down: [https://www.steelpalisade.net/images/palisadefence/expandedmetalfence-1.jpg](https://www.steelpalisade.net/images/palisadefence/expandedmetalfence-1.jpg)  


I just stared at it while it went to the stairs, from my perspective it looked like it was detracting from my direction and going back to the stairs. I wasnt believing what I was seeing so I really still didnt move ever since i opened my eyes at that point. It took about 8-10 secs before it reached the stairs which is around 7-8 meters away from where I slept.  


THEN THIS IS THE WTH MOMENT. When it finally reached the stairs, it kinda like went vertical as if it touched some sort of vertical surface and stuck to it AND THEN it started burning. Black fire/burning, mid-air on one of the stair's steps. The texture of the fire is similar to that when there is no signal on television, but turned black. (at this point, ever since the silver fence thing went vertical and looked like it touched something it had disappeared afterwards, its now just the fire)  


At this moment, I was pretty much awake already, and to see if I was just seeing things. I looked around, I didnt really stood up from the sofa. But I moved my head around the sides (lean), and poked my head forward from different angles to see if I was seeing things. But the burning object was really in that 3D space.   


It wasnt something stuck on my eye or anything like that. I looked around the living room, poked my head towards it, to the sides, it really was there. 

The burning took about another 15 seconds until it then slowly faded away and disappeared. All in the all the entire experience from waking up was probably around 30 secs.

I discovered after that that my dad wasn't home anymore and has left while I slept and I was home alone. It was morning already too, around 6:30-45AM. That sleep was pretty much a short nap.  


Scared me a lot, but my curiosity was peaked even more. I stared at it for another 2 minutes, at least where it was, before my GF started messaging me the usual good mornings and all then I told her what I've just experienced.

I had other experiences in this house prior like there used to be something knocking on the windows at night, or at the second floor where people wouldn't be able to reach even with a ladder, weird presence feeling together with a subtle sound that you hear like when a tv or radio has no signal, But thats another story. 

If this gets deleted here its fine, I'm not sure of the subreddit rules. I'm not even sure if it belongs here because it might be more like a paranormal experience. 

SOO just shared it here, because MAYBE just maybe someone might have had a similar experience. Its 4AM here now, I might try to repost this on paranormal subs and see if someone might have similar experiences from there too","My Paranormal/Possible Abduction Experience, maybe someone can explain?"

aliens,,"Spaced Out Radio hosted by Dave Scott, 28 April 2020: A very interesting interview with D.A. Roberts. [Bigfoot, Dogman, Missing People]"
aliens,"Interview with mortician W. Glenn Davis, alleged firsthand witness to events at Roswell Army Air Force Hospital concerning recovered alien bodies [https://youtu.be/\_DA-g94Ro1I](https://youtu.be/_DA-g94Ro1I)",Roswell mortician talks about alleged recovery of alien bodies in 1947
aliens,"Basically the title. We all know of the famous Roswell UFO incident that may or may not have been a threat to Russia or China etc. However I firmly believe it was a saucer of extra-terrestrial origin that crashed and was recovered by the US Air Force and shipped at least partly to Area 51. I think it then escalated American technology and possibly global technology if the US shared it with their allies and spies of other countries may have discovered it and copied it. I think many modern fighter jets use technology that is back engineered from alien crafts. 

Think about what Bob Lazar has said about Area 51. It's all coming true slowly. The Pentagon have officially said that no other countries possess technology witnessed in the UFOs. They could be lying to cover themselves from having such technology. Maybe we have already evolved to advance to that point in technology. But if you take everything at face value the Pentagon have unofficially acknowledged the existence of extra-terrestrials. This also brings into question what the US Hardvard Professor said about Omouamoua being an e.t. drone from interstellar space. 

Not the best source but there are plenty out there if you search for them:  [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/oumuamua-interstellar-harvard-astrophysicist/580948/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/oumuamua-interstellar-harvard-astrophysicist/580948/) 

Other UFO sightings such as the Phoenix Lights and mass UFO sightings by the White house should also be addressed. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952\_Washington,\_D.C.\_UFO\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident)  

I am sure there are many other important UFO sightings and these are just the popular ones I could dig up in a few minutes. But I would like to compile a list of UFO sightings from other countries. I am from the UK and we have our own Roswell in the form of Rendalsham Forest Incident.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham\_Forest\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident) 

The British Government claimed to be making all the previously classified UFO files declassified and open source to the public but they have since been silent on that. Obviously due to COVID-19 that may be delayed.  [https://www.livescience.com/uk-ufo-reports-soon-released.html](https://www.livescience.com/uk-ufo-reports-soon-released.html) 

The US Navy also wanted to make it easier to submit UFO sightings since many of their sailors have sighted UFOs out in the ocean that seem to be able to dive into the water and shoot back out again.  [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/us-military-wants-pilots-report-ufos-despite-stigma/588232/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/us-military-wants-pilots-report-ufos-despite-stigma/588232/) 

Don't forget the British man who hacked the US Pentagon and said in an interview that he saw a massive cigar shaped UFO sighting in Earth's orbit in near space among other things and that lots of modern technology was back engineered.  [https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/5988-british-man-gets-charged-hacking-pentagon-and-nasa-computers](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/5988-british-man-gets-charged-hacking-pentagon-and-nasa-computers) 

These are just a few sources I could find at a moment's notice. But I will do more in depth research. I would like to write a book some day or possibly read more books about Ufology because I think Ufology has been massively demonized by the media and social constructs. Governments don't have to do anything to stop Ufology because people instantly think of little green men when any UFO story comes out and it is basically a meme at this point unfortunately.

Not to mention the infamous Area 51 ""raid"" that attempted to happen last year. Basically I think we need more normalization of Ufology and discussing the possibility of extra-terrestrial life even in our solar system. What do you think? We are already entering the age of space travel. NASA has picked their companies to start taking humans to the moon in 2024.  [https://www.space.com/nasa-picks-first-private-moon-lander-partners.html](https://www.space.com/nasa-picks-first-private-moon-lander-partners.html) 

Hopefully we can put past beliefs about space behind us and treat Ufology with an open mind in the years to come. I definitely think within this decade so called ""Disclosure"" will happen. It is inevitable. Just last year no one could have imagined the entire world would shut down due to a flu-like disease. But here we are. What do you think? Any thoughts on my ideas? Sorry for rambling but I hope it's interesting.","During 1947, the US Air Force announced that a flying disc crashed in Roswell, New Mexico. They retracted that statement citing it was a hot air balloon. Now that UFOs are slowly becoming normalized by the Navy and Pentagon, we should reassess the Roswell UFO Incident!"

aliens,"""As I got close to it ... it rapidly accelerated to the south, and disappeared in less than two seconds” - pilot David Fravor, who filmed the declassified pentagon videos. If these Ariel phenomena are in fact manned craft, that means they are indeed moving at inhuman speeds. The altimeter says 25,000 feet, so that sets the horizon at 6.1 miles away. That’s at a minimum 3.05 miles per minute, or 10,980 mph, plus the 1,190 mph the F-18 was traveling at, makes it 12,170 MPH, assuming that it took a full 2 second. Roughly 16 times the speed of sound, and about 3 times faster than any previous manned aircraft**. That would make it by far the most technologically advanced propulsion system of any known craft.

**The record for manned aircraft speed is 4,520 MPH. This doesn’t include the unmanned air speed record of 13,201 MPH by the HTV 2. Not having a passenger aboard allows for a greater aerodynamic design, as well as greatly reduced size and weight of the craft. This also doesn’t’t include spacecraft. The Apollo 11 mission reached nearly twice the speed of this UAP on its return to earth, however this is with gravitational assistance from the Earth as well as no air resistance. If this phenomenon was to confirmed as to being a manned craft it would be especially impressive due to the shape being not particularly aerodynamic as well as it’s free ability to rotate on any axis.",Guesstimating the speed of the aircraft in the pentagon videos
aliens,,"A SKEPTICAL LOOK AT ""HISTORY"" CHANNEL'S ""SKINWALKER RANCH"" EPISODES - - Microwaves, Dead Cows and Light Pillars"
aliens,"Here’s my three main points I hope to prove to you, the reader.
1. Aliens come from a world with a very thick atmosphere and high gravity.
2. Aliens live or stay deep in the oceans of earth.
3. They are not hostile.

Now for point number one my two main evidence sources are the idea of them being small big headed grey aliens and the Nimitz encounters. They live on a planet with a thick atmosphere because the crafts we saw in the Nimitz encounters moved incredibly quickly but completely negated atmospheric effects and a way that you could stop the noise from breaking the sound barrier is simply move the air outta the way creating a vacuum of which sound can’t travel through but coincidentally that’s a great way to escape a home planet with a thick atmosphere because without it you’d need a lot more energy to propel your way through it. They come from a planet with a high gravity because as described they are small in size and seem slick skinned and more flesh than bone and with high gravity bones aren’t very useful as they cause lots of problems but they work as structure and 
And in the Nimitz encounters the crafts were accelerating and stopping in a dime which would put a lot of G’s on any passenger and living on a high gravity world could make a being able to stand higher G’s than humans can.

Point two is that aliens live deep in the oceans and it’s pretty straight forward. The Nimitz encounters took place in the pacific near Mexico which is water that’s not incredibly well explored and much of earths oceans are hardly explored at all meaning it’s an amazing hiding place from humans. And the crafts I believe are built for space and the ocean aswell as high atmosphere because a circular shape is great way to deal with all of those things because it negates lots and lots of pressure and stress on a craft. And more with the oceans you can get to any continent or land mass on earth simply by the oceans and going under the surface makes you invisible to travel freely and the oceans are a great place to study life on earth aswell as geological activity and atmospheric studies without even having to risk interacting with humans. 

Now this last one is kind’ve obvious because we’ve never been attacked and if they wanted to well we’d be shit outta luck. And if abductions really have happened to people well that sounds like research not an attack. And with the Nimitz encounters instead of just straight blowing the jets outta the sky they lead the jets away from the large 45-35 ft object the pilots in the water meaning to me atleast they don’t wanna attack they simply don’t want to be disturbed and they’d like to continue doing as they please without giving themselves away or hurting humans.

If you have any suggestions to back the idea please leave them below if you think you can debunk my theory or disprove it please tell me as I’m always willing to learn and if I’m wrong I’d like to know. Anyways thank you for reading my idea.",My Fairly Pluasible Alien Theory.

aliens,"Elizondo the former head of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program  made an at first interesting comment.  He said that the dept of defense would gladly tell us of the presence of alien craft if they could but then our enemies China and Russia would also be alerted.  Well good I'm thinking.  That explains the disclosure block.  But then if you stop and think about it it sounds like he's dodging the disclosure issue-because certainly China and Russia have their own sightings just like every other place in the world so, admitting we have sightings here wouldn't be telling them anything new.  But it seems like our govt. won't even admit to sightings.  Maybe in part they still fear social disruption.  *What his comment does suggest is that we know some good shit beyond just sightings.*  In fact when asked by the Fox reporter if we have any artifacts from aliens he would only say 'yes'.  And there is plenty of testimony from astronauts and other high ups, sometimes of contact with actual beings.  See Gordon Cooper or Ed Mitchell.

As for a formal evening news admitting by top military and govt officials maybe there is none but if you watch a few videos you see how they are coming forth with some form of disclosure.  Aside from the talks given by Elizondo another example is the F18 pilots  who encountered the 'tic tac' crafts who openly admit that when one of the craft became aware of the F18 presence it then came up and interacted with them by basically flying circles around them and demonstrating superior flying abilities.  The thing then shot off instantly, just gone the pilot reported.  And when the lead pilot radioed that they were breaking off and  heading back to the CAP location -whatever that is- which was 70 miles away, the other radio man came back and said 'you won't believe this but the craft is already at your CAP location.""  Some form of psychic ability on the part of the aliens is suggested here.  So there is some disclosure that there are intelligent minds behind the ufo's.  And talking to the F18 pilot another navy man said, regarding the tic tacs that they are seen all the time up and down the east coast.  More disclosure.",interesting comment by Luis Elizondo
aliens,"Hi everyone!  I originally posted this to r/Paranormal, but I figured that it was also appropriate for this subreddit as well.

This is a long post so please strap in for this one.  I live in the tristate area of Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee.  These areas are sparsely populated and rarely have any outside visitors/tourists so it's an excellent place for hikers (like me) to walk alone in peace.  My favorite place to go was the Fort Pillow State Park in Lauderdale County Tennessee due to the sheer scale of the woods and the great effort the rangers took to keep the trails safe and free of litter.

I think it was around the time that summer break started in 2017 (I was sixteen at the time.)  I decided to take my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a drive to the state park and have a nice stroll through nature, for it was a beautiful day that wasn't too hot or humid.  Needless to say I had a great time and was even able to buy a harmonica from the gift shop.

At the time of leaving the park I'm pretty sure that it was about 4 in the afternoon, it was an hour drive from the park to where I lived so I didn't want to make it back home too late.  I drove through the whole park, things didn't start getting weird until I reached the front gate of the State Park.

Normally when leaving the gate you drive down the road and come across an abandoned church at a three-way intersection, you'll have to turn left and drive past the West Tennessee State Penitentiary and through a small town named Cherry.  This whole drive takes about 15-20 minutes until you actually reach Ripley/Henning and the highway that I used to get back home.  However, when driving out of the gate, I looked up at the rear view mirror and saw...  The West Tennessee State Penitentiary.  Extremely unusual considering that was at least ten minutes down the road from the state park itself.   

My dash clock showed that roughly an hour and 30 minutes had passed, a striking difference in time from a drive that was only supposed to be 15-20 minutes.  The weather had significantly changed too, at this point the sky was covered in dark gray clouds with darker storm clouds that seemed to be moving in from the North.  My music had also stopped playing due to me starting a track at the latter half of an album when I left.  There was also a text message and a Snapchat notification on my phone that I have failed to notice when they came in about 30 minutes prior.  

I was extremely rattled by the situation, but I figured that it was best that I got home ASAP so I could rest this off.  It also didn't help my rattled nerves that I had to drive through a tornado warning once I made it past Dyersburg.  At this point I was rushing 15-20 over the limit on the interstate out of my desperation of wanting to go home.

I made it home around 6:30 pm and just laid in bed until it started getting dark outside, I was disturbed beyond belief and could not bring myself to do something as simple as watching a YouTube video to calm me down.  Once 10pm rolled around I found myself falling asleep.

I was restless that night, every time I drifted I would only wake up fifteen minutes later with my sheets soaked in sweat.  I also felt a great amount of chest pains when waking up in the night, the fear of possibly having a heart attack that night only furthered my anxiety as the minutes rolled by.  I found it difficult to close my eyes, for every time I did it felt like a figure was standing over my bed to examine me.  There were even points in the night where I felt like I was levitating as the room gently spun before my closed eyes.

Around 4 in the morning my throat was parched and I was desperate to have a glass of water.  I was convinced there was something in the kitchen waiting for me, so I could only bring myself to scurry to the bathroom right next to my bedroom.  I turned on the faucet and cupped my hands in order to gulp in as much water as I could.  After quenching my thirst I remember looking up in the mirror to get a good look at myself.  All the color was drained from my face as if I were a corpse.  My hair was also matted in grease, presumably from all the sweat that I had expunged thus far.

I went back to bed in order to try and sleep the night away.  I still woke up a few more times with the same feelings of chest pains and buckets of sweat, but I eventually reached a period where I seemingly got about 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

Noon was around the time that I had woken up the next day.  All of my anxiety was flushed away and my chest felt fine.  Other than feeling extremely thirsty again and needing to use the bathroom nothing at all was out of the ordinary.  I thought about this event for months on end after that day to only have mild amounts of anxiety follow, but never as bad as the day that it happened.

I only started thinking about that day again because a neighbor is currently buying my jeep.  I cleaned it out yesterday because I'm a very disorganized person who loves to leave clutter anywhere (nothing disposable or food related, just stuff that I'd never use.)  When putting up the tent in the shed something fell out from the canopy and thudded on the wooden floor of the shed.  I looked down to see that it was the harmonica that I purchased at the gift shop that day.

Let me know what you guys think of the situation.  I've told my story to some people and the majority of them chocked it up to highway hypnosis.  I fail to see this theory holding weight as I was really into the music I was listening to and I would have noticed when it switched off at the end of the album.  I'm never one to go slow either, I usually push for five over whenever I'm driving in a familiar region.  From what I remember, I was also on cruise control and this feature never bugged out on me before.",Possible Abduction When I Was Sixteen
aliens,"Back in 2016 I took a few pictures out of an airplane window over the southwest United States showing a large saucer shaped object a few thousand feet off of the ground. It seemed to hover perfectly still even with ~30 MPH winds (give or take, I’m not exactly sure where this was but the entire south east US had pretty decent winds that day ranging from 15-40 MPH at roughly that time). The object hovered for about 3-4 minutes before moving parallel to the airplane, matching its speed for a minute, and then darting away. I need to dig through my iCloud storage to see if I have the photos backed up (they were Live Photo’s so I’ll post them as 2 short videos).

aliens,So this morning i was in my living room in my third floor apartment playing xbox with my cat lying next to me. It was daylight out and the room had a normal natural light to it.(no other lights were on). In between games I'm petting my cat and boom an almost blinding flash of light came right through my window. It was so bright that i thought i could of hallucinated it. (Keep in mind being on the third floor and being daylight it couldn't be a car light) the reason i know i didn't hallucinate is because the light scared tf outta my cat. She freaked out and ran straight for the door and looked out. On top of this me and my gf were just on a drive around 30 minutes ago. We saw multiple lights in the sky disappear then reappear. I want to know if this is legit I am emotionally/spiritually stable so I know my mind isn't playing tricks on me. Lmk what y'all think.,Is it possible?

aliens,"As most of us in this group are aware the pentagon has released a statement of an older video confirming it was in fact a UFO. If you arnt aware now you are..hehe. But why now? 
I think something big is going to happen involving other life forms and here is why.
The government WILL NOT tell us anything until it is to the point that we will know regardless...or if they have an angle and can use the information to their advantage. Whatever your take on COVID, the illness has been circulating far past what announcements were ever made, they just thought they could control it and sliiiiide it right on by us. Only at the point it was not able to be hidden anymore did they release the actual monument of it. So why are they just now telling us about ufos? We’ve seen them, or at least I have. It’s acknowledged yet they have always treated it as a opinion and not a fact. I think things are getting to a point where we will NOT be able to hide this anymore. Something is going to happen( in my opinion) I was camping with friends a couple weeks ago and we ALL saw a horizontal line of lights in the sky perfectly spaced out circling across the sky, we all commented on how weird it was what we were seeing. They were being distributed by what looked like a star. I thought it was weird but didn’t do much investigating this was around 10pm pst. I watched them for about two hours just disappear and regenerate in such perfect formation. After the release of the information I saw a forum talking about how others saw the EXACT thing. After vocalizing it with a friend who was not present she told me she saw it too in a different state. She saw them around 2am pst but as she was watching them they allllllll just SPED OFF. Out of perfect formation. Not to be like over the top but it was an ambush vibe. And for those who will say why would they attack now and not have done it sooner...time is relative.

aliens,"I believe that aliens exist. There is nothing that anybody can say or do to make believe otherwise. However, I view aliens in a very different way than the majority of people do. When people think of aliens, the first couple of things that pops into everybody's minds are flying saucers, Area 51, and pictures of tall gray creatures with big black eyes and two holes where a nose would be. That's what everyone thinks about when they hear the word ""alien"" and that's why the whole idea of aliens existing is taken as a joke. But think about this. The universe is literally infinite. And I'm not using the word literally simply to add extra effect, no, the universe is LITERALLY INFINITE. We will never be able to travel the entire distance of the universe, because the universe has no end. With that knowledge in mind, if you still honestly believe that humans are the only form of intelligent life in the entire universe, then you're an idiot. I'm not saying that there are little martian men in flying saucers watching us 24/7 and plotting to take over the earth. I'm just saying that they exist. Personally, I don't believe that aliens have visited us yet, and I don't believe in flying saucers. Basically every alien cliche you can think of is something that I consider to be complete bullshit. I'd be open to discussing why someone believes in those things, and I might even change my opinion. But that's the thing. The idea of there being some other form of intelligent life just confuses people so much that even though they can't disprove it in any way, they refuse to believe it. It's mainly due to all the crazy conspiracy theorists and alien shows on tv. It's been talked about so much and in so many ridiculous ways that now the whole idea of aliens is considered to be purely fiction. Because of this, in a way, humans are quite possibly the strangest creatures we know to exist right now. They're so used to going along with what other people think that they will refuse to even consider the ideas and beliefs of someone else.",My opinion about aliens

aliens,"People always tend to jump to the conclusion that we are “most likely” like ants to aliens and theres no way they could possibly relate to us on any level or they evolved past the ability to understand us, or care about our civilization past their own interests... I don’t understand why this is the default assumption.

Looking at our civilization, it doesn’t seem like were too far out from achieving similar technology to what we believe aliens have such as their ships. By “not too far out,” I’ll be fair and say within the next 300 to 400 years at least... That is STILL not enough time to pass where a species would completely evolve out of their base characteristics such as curiosity and drive for achievement that led them to build their ships in the first place and explore, so why must we always assume that aliens are always 50,000 years+ ahead of us? Or that these aliens have evolved into a creature that completely integrated with technology and is running purely off advancing technologically, caring about nothing else?

Sure that could be a possibility, but it’s no more likely then an alien species to be no less than 300 years ahead of us... So when I see people comment that “aliens are lightyears ahead of us and we are probably like a zoo to them,” as if it’s obviously the most likely scenario, I think they couldn’t be more wrong.

P.S: To get even more crazy I think aliens in their space ships can be even less advanced than us... Yup, that’s right, I said it.

A society could have easily developed on another planet with completely different resources needed to survive and most likely had completely different niches in order to survive. This means they could have had a completely different series of events leading up to their development of their technology.

It could be possible that given the resources on their planet and how their society runs, that they were able to create spacecraft before their society was able to develop a lot of the things humanity has such as art, certain culture, or even weaponizing nuclear energy. 

Maybe on their planet, they can survive much more efficiently than humans and completely skipped having to compete for resources. This means from the get go, their society or brains are wired to help each other to achieve their goal in the fastest way possible while disregarding their sacrifice to personal pleasures or greed? They might have arrived to Earth with the concept of war being entirely new to them...",Why do we always have to assume that aliens are lightyears ahead of us?

In my opinion the universes constructs themselves are viable for a religion or else higher form of consciousness or entity with the ability to change the universe.

My hypothesis, or what I think might be possible is that the periodic table is set up in a numerical order but their weights are non linear, or otherwise not fine in how clearly they are different. 
Perhaps the universe and the aliens worked together like us now from in many civilizations before. Maybe racism is new from a biological perspective? Some aliens were described with no eyes (Pascagoula).
That would mean there are different average values for any given atomic weight, perhaps that is how the craft released to us also flies in the water from water expanding when it is frozen, from some unlimited quantum source of energy.

aliens,"Hey guys, after reading about the Israeli politicians coming out about aliens, I've been turning something over in my mind. He said that they are waiting for us to understand what space and spaceships are. That sent me down an interesting thought trail. 

What IS space? Well, whether it's the space outside our atmosphere, or the airspace in our atmosphere, space is essentially layers of molecules varying in viscosity. I imagine that the molecules of lower levels of atmosphere move much slower than those of higher up, and those move much slower than any gaseous molecules in outer space. A spaceship is just a ship utilising force to fight gravity and stay afloat like a submarine utilises force to fight gravity to stay afloat. Keep in mind that humanities airships require more force than a submarine to fight gravity.

Now, when you see the accounts of the naval pilots who witnessed UFO capabilities, it makes you wonder how these vessels can have enough force to move so effortlessly against wind resistance, as well as having enough force to come to complete stops after moving one direction with so much momentum. 

Maybe, just maybe, and hear me out, UFOs can utilise a tool to make flying through the sky require as little force as it takes to float through the sea. This tool is completely theoretical, I have no idea how it would work, as the known laws of physics dont allow for it. I theorize that possibly a gravity generator could create a time dilation around a vessel, and the vessel only (again, i have no idea how you'd be able to limit the time dilation effect to just the vessel.) 

Think back to interstellar, and how closer to the black hole time dilation made your perception of time move slower. If someone on earth could witness someone inside a time dilation field, they would see them moving considerably faster, and the person watching them would seem to be in slow mo from the perspective of the other person. 

Still with me? If you could create this dilation effect around just the vessel, but not the rest of the environment, the air molecules in the ship would speed up with you, but not the air molecules outside the ship. That would make those air molecules outside the ship behave like water, seeing as their kinetic energy would be greatly lessened. You would require more force to move/part the molecules, making wind resistance more like water resistance, but you'd be able to fight gravity easier and float like a submarine. I'm having a hard time remembering some of the other points I reached in my mind earlier, if you have questions please ask, I'm seeking discussion.",How spaceships could work

So I was sleeping, and my mom woke me approximately at 5:30 am just to let me know that she was going to leave for a Dr's appointment.

It was flying near my house. That's all I remember from the dream but I remember it clearly. Then, I wake up around 7:30am and felt that I was asleep way longer than 2 hours.

aliens,"I think study them. 

Announce the discovery to the entire world, and everyone would be EAGER and almost demand to learn more about these other intelligent life forms. People would throw money at this study. 

So, we’d study them. Probably wouldn’t want to get too close at first, wouldn’t want them to detect us because we wouldn’t know how they’d react to us, but get close enough to observe their behavior and their entire society, how they’re divided, how they live, do they have numerous cultures similar to ours, etc. 

Maybe discover that their planet is a hostile environment. Quite a delicate infrastructure, with a lot of hate towards each other. Best not to be detected. 

Now back on Earth there are news articles, shows, endless content that people would be eager to digest and learn more about this mystery planet. Who are these beings?

If their technology isn’t as advanced as ours, then maybe we find a way to get even closer without being detected (people back on Earth would LOVE this), maybe get even more ballsy and try to actually land on their planet if their technology is definitely inferior to ours and observe them up close. Observe the environment, collect samples. 

Now the money is raking in, big investors now, and people are demanding to learn more. Maybe we would go as far to grab one of them and inspect them like a lab rat, taking videos and pictures and sending them back to Earth. 

Maybe we get detected, and someone, a high authority figure from their world captures one of our own, and tries to make contact with us. Demanding to know who we are and our intentions. We try to communicate back. The smartest people in their world and ours find a way to communicate and somewhere along the road it’s decided that their world is too fragile. They cannot know of our existence. Each one of their cultures are at the brink of war, and if they find out there are other beings, studying them... they’ll be frightened, they will panic, religions will be blown apart, there would be chaos, who knows...

Now let’s assume we are not smartest beings in the universe... I’m decent at math, but there are theories my brain can absolutely not comprehend. We are not THAT smart (sorry folks, it’s true)...

Then there's Canadian official, Paul Hellyer, who also talked of the Galactic Federation before. But apparently all of his claims of aliens, are not based on his tenure of office. 

So both of these officials' claims are second-hand?

I was reading tweets about Lue Elizondo: former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATTIP), the secretive Pentagon unit that studied UFOs. He is apparently quite credible since he backs up his claims with hard evidence. He claims we're not alone.

Firstly, I mean absolutely no disrespect to the content creators, I love the content and the wide variety of topics they cover. Mad respect for the time it must take.

What bugs me is, amongst their following, it seems the general consensus is that all of this amazing information is reliable fact without corroboration. When the only source is attributed to an awfuly vague direct ET communication via the internet.

aliens,"This was 30 minutes ago, so 4:30am approximately where I live. I work night shift so it was still very dark out.

I started driving and my place of work is by a little residential area with a lot of woods behind them. I was turning on this winding road and in the trees I spotted a single leg, mid-stride, heading into the trees. The leg was long, like it belonged to someone or something around 6 foot tall and it was distinctly gray. When my headlights hit the leg, it calmly and almost gracefully stepped into the trees. I pulled up next to the spot and could see very thick vegetation. I looked for movement in the leaves and shrubs to see if something had just walked past it and I saw no movement, just stillness. 

Now there a lot of deer in that area, but this leg was not like any animal I had ever seen. And again, it was long like a humans but it didn’t seem to have any pants or anything like that. 

I felt like I was meant to see what I saw, almost like a little nudge and a wink that something else was there with me and that it knew I saw it. Not jumping to any conclusions, but I am open to discussion if anyone has experienced something similar.",I don’t know what I just saw

aliens,"The reason why in the last couple decades is that we have had so many sightings is because Ebe's are trying to help us. The government the military, cia, DOD, northcom all those governing bodies are pretty much run and funded by corporations, and if something from somewhere else was to show us a better way to live our life, that could totally uproot the corporations and how the world is run. I believe we have had much alien influence for many years up until Roswell, now it's a big smoke screen and cover up because these people want to use what knowledge or tech they have been gifted or uncovered for themselves. They may have even told something from somewhere else that they will use whatever they may have been gifted or learned to help humanity, but instead use it for financial gain. Like we could totally do without oil, nuclear power, etc, but so many conapines would stop making money, not lose, just stop profiting. When you have control and power and use evil and fear and manipulation to rule the world for so long it's hard to back out from that, or get the powers at be put of that position. I think the only way we could save ourselves is if every citizen just stopped working, said I'm not going anywhere or doing anything until these people hear us out and change the way things work, except maybe health care professions. So until that happens, let's hope and pray someday the governing bodies stop hiding the truth from us, or aliens can finally make a breakthrough, maybe there scared if they try help us, we may just be stupid enough to start pushing buttons and put us in a nuclear holocaust just to prove a point that it's our planet.",Alien intervention theory
aliens,"The more research I do on aliens and abductions the more I start to believe that giant mantis aliens are a self engineered body made by Fallen angels that also interbreed with humans creating hybrids called the Nephilim, these where giants in Biblical believes that shared knowledge with humans how to make weaponry, makeup and more which is what grey aliens do with the US government in exchange for a blood sacrifice, is why cattle mutilations happen. Aliens have a strong connection with cults and spirits. Google: Interdimensional hypothesis

If you observe a praying mantis and different kind of Mantids it looks like they interbreed with humans and eventually shaped their DNA into humanoid greys or even more human like hybrids that fit the picture of a Succubus that lay on top of you when you are paralyzed to impregnate themselves (Google: David Huggins  or Peter Khoury)

There are different type of aliens, Giant mantis, Giant lizard, blonde Nordics and the rest seem to be hybrids from there. These beings can swap body according several abductions like the movie Avatar, it can be that embryos are used as vessels for these spiritual light orbs in order to be physical.

Dravidians: They seek unified, nature &amp; faith-based, spiritual living. 

Aryan: They seek order, dominance, etc. 

Neither is better than the other.

‘A’s typically dominate over the ‘D’s, and in situations where they do, planets usually are consumed of their resources &amp; are consumed by their star. In situations where ‘D’s dominate, they live peacefully until extinction on their home planet.

Occasionally these species are able to achieve interstellar travel, but not often.

Now would the real slim shady please stand up.


The Greys.

Betcha didn’t see them coming. But what I think you MAY have not thought about before, is they are likely already on earth, naturally.

The greys have minds that work similar to a quantum computer. This is because they have evolved beyond the “A vs D” into a separate race that is not better, but relies on the best logical outcome of interactions between existing races. Kinda like a quantum computer. They are not good, or bad. just fair. This is why they are called Greys.

So I recently moved out to the countryside and have been keeping my eyes on the sky and I've seen some weird things lately, was wondering what people think of my encounters. I have been seeing lights that look exactly like stars move across the sky. Some I think are satellites as they follow a straight path, but the others will kind of just move about the sky, get brighter and dimmer, move fast then slow and then disappear. But the weirdest thing is that I've now found three stars that stay in a general area, but move about that area. They're in the same spot every night, but if you sit and watch them they will move in circles, wobble around and sometimes move to the left/right, circle a bit &amp; go back to where it usually sits. I've seen the other moving stars travel by the stationary ones, and they will go faster by it, pulse real bright &amp; get dimmer a few times then they disappear. I have no idea what to make of it. I have sat and focused on other stars to compare but none of them move the way the other three I have seen do. My boyfriend and two of my friends have seen them move as well. Any thoughts? Are there satellites that move like this? Really just want to get to the truth of what I'm seeing, even if it's lame like satellites haha. Any input would be appreciated! Tyia!",Moving stars

aliens,"Hi all! Just wanted to pose a few questions here for people to consider:

Many of us have been interested in UFO/extraterrestrial activity for a while and wish for ""disclosure"" or physical contact at a global scale. With all the issues we have on the planet because of prejudice, hate war, and greed, I find it hard to predict if humans will be able to embrace beings from outside our planet when we can't event embrace each other here in our own planet. Humans tend to treat those that are deemed different as ""alien"" or an ""other"" in a negative sense-- the reasons for this range from sexualit, race, language, culture, and geographical location. These are such petty reasons for being hateful towards each other when we think of a whole universe full of diversity and life.

I often worry that even if these extraterrestrials were not harmful and had good intentions, we will freak out and think of them as an enemy.  For these reasons I think we may have a long way to go before we can make full physical contact at a large scale with them. Which is honestly sad to think about.",How can we accept extraterrestrials when we can't accept each other?
aliens,"If one looks into the survey of Federal Funds for Academic Research and Development as the primary source of information about federal funding for R&amp;D in the United States. With the US federal government so closely linked with such important funding to academia has this created a barrier to actual disclosure?

If one looks at the survey it is an annual census completed by the federal agencies that conduct R&amp;D programs. It does reflect considerable financial grants to Academia. Is this why academia has been so silent on these issues and others? As a means to continue to receive their own federal funding?

Actual data is collected for the fiscal year just completed; estimates are obtained for the current fiscal year. Research and consultations quietly occur but due to federal funding the public and society at large has been kept out of the knowledge acquired or gained.

It is an import area that has been overlooked as to why academia has been so silent for so many decades.","Have academics silently met with DOD officials and signed NDA's even they can not disclose, thereby shutting down Academia to UFO/UAP to disclosure?"

Now tell me what do be have proof of that gives people the confidence to say that to someone as if they had their own proof to compare it to. And if you do have some proof of anything besides dinosaur bones and pyramids with the hieroglyphs and them because that is some of the only proof any ancient history we have and all this other stuff people claim to be true and are comparing to don't have any proof and if you do please show me. 

Don't get me wrong I understand the importance of proof  but people don't realize they live everyday following and believing in something they have never seen proof of and one of the biggest ones is religion so many different ones believe in  different books that all have different stories with different beliefs and even the ones who they worship are different but with different commandments so to speak different rules to go by. When in all actuality they are all worshiping the same being the almighty. Don't you think if they had proof there would only be one religion? Just imagine if we seem proof of jesus's cross still standing in the same spot or if they were able to find Noah's ark or if they were able to find the tree with the Apple's that we weren't supposed to be eating if we still had a place on this land we call Eden or anything or still had snakes that can talk

And so in actuality everything that we believe in is a theory still yet to be proven and the truth is religion is set and givin to us for the purpose of separation and to hold us back from   moving forward and there isn't any Bible similar things teaching us anything new. And  we are too busy living in the past by following something we barely can even interpret the real meaning of some of the things said in them and still do all of the things it tells us not to do

And I hate to have to use religion in the Bible but that is the what people are comparing to when they claim to need to see proof all of a sudden when the proof is well the truth is when you do see some proof and learn the truth that you have been worshipping aliens this whole time.

aliens,Where does this come from?,Why do people think the alien god beings feed on negative emotions?
aliens,"Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today to lay to rest, Mankind. Humans as they called themselves. Gone too soon with so much lost potential.

Man started simply. As most species do. Just another of this universe’s creatures trying to survive, until one special subject discovered he/she could alter their surroundings to make tools. From there it was off to the races. 

Not soon after making tools from stones they starting using fire to forge their tools into hardened metals and alloys. Just 10,000 years separated those tool makers to the smartphone users of recent. That is an extraordinarily exponential growth. Just 66 years separated the Wright bros first manned flight to the moon landing. Astonishing.

I don’t think anyone can deny the ingenuity of this species. They were never satisfied in large with the ways of the time. They always had a small percentage that wanted things improved. Bigger, better, stronger, faster. Always improving the situation but rarely improving themselves which was their downfall as we know. 

Mankind. Ironic isn’t it? Kind is anything but what they were to each other. Their ingenuity was valuable attribute but they began to turn it on each other, developing more and more weapons of mass destruction. But while the greedy and violent ultimately had control of the planet and led them to their demise. There was the by and large who “got it” as they say. 

I like to think that the true cause of mankinds demise was ignorance. Their speedy growth came with an arrogance and ignorance that one can get wrapped up in. Like any other adolescent, mankind was worried about the here and now over the future. As a result they allowed there leaders to be corrupted and tragically lead them to their very own demise. 

So the question remains. What should they have done different? What could they have done different? Maybe everything, maybe nothing. Perhaps the corruptibility of the human mind and emotional decision making doomed man from the start.  However, what we can say for sure is that mankind’s impact on the world they resided in was impossible to ignore. From the Great Wall of China to the pyramids in Giza. Man was capable of amazing things with limited resources. 

We shouldn’t simply shrug off mankind’s existence as a flash in the pan, but try to learn from it. Remember them when teaching curious young ones. Use them as a cautionary tale not to let their emotions take control. That greed is one of the greatest evils to exists in this universe.

aliens,"We literally live in a virtual-programmed reality. The universe is a giant hologram of staggering complexity. It constructs reality by taking ""individual"" minds and incorporating them all into a broader field of conscious minds, which then contribute to the broader consensus reality. This means consciousness creates matter and not the other way around. As a result, you can ask this hologram for anything and it will adjust variables like a videogame in order to manifest that specific desire. 

I didn't believe it until I had certain experiences followed by impossible synchronicities. Then I looked back at my life and I can't unsee it. Your thoughts are literally adjusting variables in this universe and molding reality to your desire. I am just a single anecdote, but I am living proof that we are constantly manifesting things whether we believe it or not. 


A lot of people seem to misunderstand what is actually meant by the statement ""consciousness creates matter"". It doesn't mean you alone are some demigod that can create gold out of thin air or that you can literally move mountains (although such feats are technically possible in this universe). It just means desire, intent, and imagination are the means through which this universe self-organizes into increasing complexity. The universe is an engine designed for the production and conservation of novelty (aka unique perspectives, diversity of life) and that as novelty increases, so does complexity. Each layer of complexity mirrors the previous, with every new level of complexity achieved becoming the platform for a further ascent into complexity.

I believe synchronicities are the most obvious indication of manifestation. These staggering coincidences people experience always feel meaningfully connected and that is because they are. When we experience chance happenings, fortuitous events, etc. it always feels like we were in the right place at exactly the right time. This is because it wasn't a coincidence, but rather desire that lead to that particular moment of synchronicity. Synchronicity is simply evidence of the universe adjusting variables to ensure a particular outcome. 

People always be like ""lol if manifestation is real just manifest a billion dollars right now"", but have literally no clue how manifestation actually works. The reason I can't manifest a golden turd every time I take a shit is because of something called ""consensus reality"". Belief (conscious or unconscious) in the broader consensus is the reason our reality appears stable. Most, if not all, thoughts are software programming designed to create artificial limitations on this creative force of reality-shaping that we all possess. The reason reality appears stable even though it is being constructed by our minds is because a single individual will not affect the hologram if their desire conflicts with too many other ""individual"" minds with opposing/different desires. Someone who wants to manifest, let's say, a bunch of diamonds in their living room for example would need to:

A) need to TRULY believe they have the power to do so

B) defy consensus reality and somehow overcome a field of minds whose reality cannot account for such miracles 


As you can see, the more divergent from consensus a particular desire is, the more variables will need adjusting in order to match it, and thus the more time it will take. That said, if it can be done, the universe will find a way. This is why the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is so true. The universe will find ANY way to match your internal desire. This means that your desire may manifest in the way most convenient for the Universe but not necessarily in the exact way you expected. From personal experience, this can have some pretty negative unforeseen consequences. Manifestation is a power that should not be taken lightly. 


&gt;“The decisions we make in this moment are based in either love or fear. So many of us chose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect so we never ask the universe for it. I’m saying I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. And if it doesn’t happen for you right away, it’s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order. 

-- Jim Carrey 

If you ever want evidence of manifestation just look into Jim Carrey and his life. The star of ""The Truman Show"" goes on to experience his own spiritual awakening, goes on to expose Hollywood as well as the virtual nature of our own reality. It is ""coincidences"" like this that really make you think.",Manifestation is real

* If you know of any other resources please put them in the comments!!!!!!!

Basically there is a rumor that an underground pyramid exists somewhere 50 miles northwest of Mt. McKinley. According to Tom Delonge this pyramid is some how suppressing our consciousness and has been studied by the military for decades.

Linda Moulton Howe supposedly got the exact coordinates to the location you can check out for yourself: 63.2976110, -152.5234691

The coordinates are quite unremarkable. Looks like nothing is there at all. No roads or any other signs of human activity. (Just last year [a man went looking for the Pyramid and went missing](https://craigmedred.news/2020/10/27/deadly-attraction/) around the Lake Carey area based on her coordinates, he had a satellite phone and everything, spooky!!)

I figured that if this thing was studied and guarded by the military for years there would need to be some kind of landing strip in the area based on LMH's interview with the son of a military officer who flew there.

I scoped out the area and found exactly what i was looking for and more, just north of LMH's coordinates at Lake Minchumina. Here are the coordinates: 63.90911233657512, -152.30401269384032.

below is a screenshot of the location you may notice something odd on the left right away:

You can clearly see the airfield and a long narrow road that leads to a huge circular perimeter roughly 1,800 ft across. I believe THIS is the actual site of the pyramid, and it is not too far from the original coordinates. If someone can provide a mundane explanation for this please let me know!

**The part that really blew my mind and convinced me i found the right location was reading the** [Wikipedia entry for Lake Minchumina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Minchumina,_Alaska)**. Here is the passage from the geography section:**

&gt;**""If we were to cut out a map of Alaska from a piece of paper and balance the map on the point of a pencil, we would have found the center point of the physical structure of the state. That point is at 63°50’ N, 152° W. or near Lake Minchumina.**""  
""**General Mitchell looked at Alaska on a globe. He saw that Alaska was approximately equal distance from all of the major urban-industrial centers of the world.** Figure L.1 is a map of Alaska as seen from space. It is centered on Lake Minchumina in Interior Alaska. Note that we can see the major centers of Asia (Tokyo and Beijing are shown), Europe (Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and London are shown), and North America (New York, Toronto, and Los Angeles are shown). **General Billy Mitchell viewed Alaska's relative location and found that it was, indeed, central to the urban-industrial world.""**

Already know a lot about physics abilities when it comes to the C.I.A. stargate. And know the gray aliens are known to have physics abilities. And people believe they can contact or communicate with aliens via physics abilities. So I guessed I can understand the connection between physics abilities and UFOs. Maybe not fully.

But where does the connection between Witchcraft and UFOs come in? I have seen people make that connection. This is odd because Witchcraft is a religion for Pagans, Wiccans, Voodoo/Hoodoo believers, etc. Connecting does Witchcraft religions to UFOs. Would be like Connecting Christianity and Islam to UFOs.

The gravity is pulling in the matter into an ever denser shell that wouldnt collapse because of the relatively even distribution of pressure.

There’s so many different countries with their own governments and agendas, yet not one of them have come out and said, look this is the evidence, we have found this and want to share it with the public. I’m talking solid evidence, such as physical debris from a crashed ufo. Yes there’s roswell and other ufo crashes that may have occurred. So America seems to have quite a history with ufos. However what about the rest of the world?
Surely it’s not only America that these ufos are crash landing in.

Yet none of the governments from literally hundreds of countries around the world have come out and said yep this is it sort of thing. Here’s you evidence, public take a look.

There’s the theory that all the countries are waiting for each other and don’t want to be the first to say anything as it puts them at a disadvantage. However this still doesn’t make sense as surely there would be one out of hundreds who would come forward.

Maybe they all just don’t know anything and no one actually has any real evidence. I mean if you think about it, would a technology that has mastered space time travel end up coming to earth and crashing because of our magnetic field or whatever? It doesn’t make any sense.

The only thing I’m left with is that no one actually knows much about the phenomenon. They don’t have any physical proof (apart from videos) and that’s why no one is saying anything.

I dunno guys, something just doesn’t make sense here. Hopefully someone has an explanation?",Something just doesn’t quite add up

1. Probably uploaded 6 months back about the zimbabwe alien landing incident at the school. it was more than 10 minutes and was narrated by a male. seemed to be a much older video style
2. a video of a woman who claimed she could see aliens through some kind of portal or interdimensionality. something to do with a telephone pole outside, she could detect some alien energy? the video thumbnail uploaded here was yellowish and the woman was looking through some sort of box or binoculars.

Now in the coming decades the space probe sends back images of weird and unusual phenomena, as the years went by it sends more weirder phenomena, as though the further it gets from the solar system the weird the phenomena get.

a little snippet but you should read through it all I know it sounds insane but if you've been following these Marian apparitions and UAPs/Tom Delonge/Luis Elizondo you would know UAPs are based on consciousness, example of the deception:

King claimed to have been contacted by many aliens, including [Venusians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venusians), [Martians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martians), [Devas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Buddhism)), and the [Great White Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Brotherhood) to spread a message to aid humanity. This message exalted the promising future humanity has should Earthlings turn to better ways of living, while warning of the possible consequences otherwise.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Zeller2009p331-72) King taught that humans had the choice of self-destruction or the enjoyment of a New Age that was coming to Earth. And that the Cosmic Masters had intervened via the Aetherius Society to help humanity into the New Age.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-LR2003p144-5-10)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-S2003p89-90-24)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Sa2003p131-31)

As Zeller notes in his chapter ""Apocalyptic Thought in UFO Religions,"" King believed there would not be a catastrophic end to the world, but that the planet is on the verge of a new millennium of peace and enlightenment and the Age of Aquarius. This will also require human effort.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-B2011p124-30)[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Zeller2009p331-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-LR2003p153-73) The Aetherius Society's teachings share the individualism of not only other New Age teachings of the era, but of the [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) King grew up in, i.e. individual humans face the decision of whether to join the millennial kingdom.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Sa2003p131-31)[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Zeller2009p331-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-LR2003p153-73)

The society also predicts the coming of 'the next Master' from space at an indefinite time, which is said to depend on the advancement of humans and the balance of karma.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-LR2003p144-5-10)[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-E1988p128-47)[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-74) It is claimed he will arrive in a spacecraft with great power, and present his credentials to the leaders of Earth.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-B2011p124-30)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-Sa2003p131-31) Those who engage in war or ignore the ‘Divine Law’, will be removed from the Earth and reborn upon another planet where they will continue their progress. Those who understand the law will be left on Earth to enjoy the new millennium.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-B2011p124-30)[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-75)[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-76)[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetherius_Society#cite_note-77)

If you've been following the UAP story unfold and what Tom Delonge has been saying (his company TTSA has contracts with US army, wiki leaks email with him talking to a General, his board full of PHDS) then you would know that these UAPs are based on consciousness and are evil. He claims that they've been manipulating earth for a long time.

Why is this a deception and not the truth? Because all of the major religions said that a major deception will happen

St. Paisios of Mt. Athos (1924–1994)

This prophetic intuition of the Orthodox Saint has been confirmed as authentic and appeared in *Elder Paisios — The Signs of the Times:*

**…now a vaccine has been developed to combat a new disease, which will be obligatory and those taking it will be marked… Later on, anyone who is not marked with the number 666 will not be able to either buy or sell, to get a loan, to get a job, and so forth. My thinking tells me that this is the system through which the Antichrist has chosen to take over the whole world, and people who are not part of this system won’t be able to find work and so on — whether black or white or red; in other words, everyone he will take over through an economic system that controls the global economy, and only those who have accepted the seal, the mark of the number 666, will be able to participate in business dealings**

Jacquee Valle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques\_Vall%C3%A9e#Interpretation\_of\_the\_UFO\_evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e#Interpretation_of_the_UFO_evidence) 

"" Vallée proposes that there is a genuine UFO phenomenon, partly associated with a form of non-human consciousness that manipulates space and time. The phenomenon has been active throughout human history, and seems to masquerade in various forms to different cultures. In his opinion, the intelligence behind the phenomenon attempts social manipulation by using deception on the humans with whom they interact.""

Vallée also proposes that a secondary aspect of the UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that it is highly unlikely that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that is exactly what the manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e#cite_note-10) Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.","Incoming ""Alien"" intervention, Deception and New Age"

What if the COVID fiasco is being used as a defense from Alien takeover? Obviously I do not know the details but can give some of the logic that I used to make that statement. It makes more sense that what we are going through worldwide.

First the key word-“worldwide”. When has the whole world agreed on something? US, Russia, China, Europe and small remote countries in Africa and South America all feel it is essential that everyone take a shot of DNA altering unproven drug and insist to the point of not accepting anything less than full compliance. Yes, the whole world agrees! Can’t agree on religion, abuse of citizens, democracy or communism but the DNA manipulation of their population is of universal utmost importance! Remember President Reagan’s speech at the UN where he said,” what would the world do if we were going to be attacked by an alien threat? Come together to save humanity?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD2186Yh0Uc

Remember the story of President Eisenhower meeting with the Grey’s and making the agreement to allow so many humans to be abducted in exchange for technology in 1954. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/02/19/ike-and-the-alien-ambassadors/4698e544-1dc8-4573-8b8d-2b48d2a6305e/)

I have been working with Abductees for 16 years doing Hypnotic Regressions on hundreds, all believe what they are reporting and many are the same. Many are taken back to see their hybrid children. Many have pregnancies that suddenly end and no sign of ever being pregnant. Many have had semen and samples of their bodily fluids taken. Some believe they are hybrids and can recount being on alien ships being taught the problems the earth will encounter including environmental and nuclear devastation. As you may doubt this or parts of it, don’t forget some of us have believed in UFO’s for 70 years, while being outcasts and labeled nuts until last year when the Government of the US decided they better start some trickles of the information on UFO’s and get as acclimated...for what?  Now over 50% believe, so who do you think is controlling those crafts? Silly you who stopped at “oh, they are real” without putting anymore thought into it.

All think that they are so technologically advanced, we can’t touch them, they may be right. So how does the world defend itself? What if the Cabal (Gates, Soros, and maybe some world leaders) decided the answer was ruin the human DNA so they have no interest in us, we are of no use to them, maybe then they will leave us alone. Notice the Cabal is not taking the vaccines? Executive and Legislative branches decided they do not need to take the vaccine. They are not afraid. They go in public without masks and get together with their families for Christmas and Thanksgiving when they do not think anyone is looking. Yet the average citizen must comply or lose their right to work and travel.

I do not believe it was a plot to ruin the best economy in the world was political action against Trump, the plan timeline just fell into place at that time. I believe it has been planned for many years.

I guess I'm drawing up a lot of confusions..

I just wanted to get some (genuine, not bashing for the sake of bashing) updates today about Wilcock, not because I trust him or the path his career has taken.. I just feel connected to his work as a person. Even though I don't agree with the direction he has taken or the alliances he has made to con men like Goode..

That being said - it appears he and Elizabeth are getting a divorce. Does anyone have any information on that which can confirm this? Or is this just all conjecture at this point?

Lastly, this morning I wanted to go back to an old interview he had had with Corey Goode. Yeah, I know, I know... Goode is widely full of (bleep). I'm aware of that. I've always known in my gut he's a disinformation agent and was sent in to ruin Wilcock's career and credibility. Before Goode entered into his life, Wilcock was much less insane and actually had some valuable lessons for people. But that was five years ago or more. Once Goode got into his mind, it all went down hill and quickly. He lost himself in the rabbit hole, to say.

The thing is, GAIATV seems to have removed all interviews with Corey Goode. That's the other ""FYI"" I'm looking for. Was there some sort of drama with Corey Goode? Did he go down as a fraud? What happened there? The interview in question I was looking for was one concerning Giants in stasis. There was something he had described in the interview that I had had a direct vision of prior to seeing the interview, and I wanted to compare notes. This vision was very specific its details, and Goode just happened to describe what I had seen down to the tiniest last little minuscule detail. Fairly impossible since I had had no prior exposure to what I had seen. I simply can't find that interview anymore. Or ANY old interviews with Corey Goode and Wilcock. They (Wilcock and Goode) did dozens of interviews, and they're all mysteriously vanished.

The story describes Linda suddenly awake above her bed to see strange figures in the process of levitation. Once on board a craft, she was subject to medical analysis and alien experimentation by different beings, some human in appearance. As her account later gained attention, two men came forward as “witnesses” who ultimately went on to kidnap and interrogate her multiple times, leading Napolitano to believe it was a cover-up.

Linda’s recollection of events, like many before and after her, had deployed critics. In subsequent years since her experiences, medical professionals associated with the case have found that she is of sound mind. Walter H.

aliens,"This was originally a comment but I thought I would share with everyone who is interested. I wasn't sure where to post this so I posted in r/ufob as well.

I live in Australia, I was at a mates place down in the bush going for a piss in his backyard as we were having a few drinks outside. Unfortunately he was in his shed so he didn't see this. I looked up at the stars and saw a green, red, blue flashing light which I thought was super strange. Then I saw it shoot off into the cosmos, which at that point I could temporarily perceive the depth of the space and stars I was looking at due to the direction the line of light went in (light was trying to catch up with the object hence the line [imagine the lines you make with sparklers]). Blew my absolute god damn mind. I'm guessing I witnessed what we would call warp drive technology in action but I believe it's much, much more advanced than that after hearing Lazar's experience/description. I could provide a drawing or photoshop an image to demonstrate what I'm explaining if it helps.

Literally a week or two after that event, we both saw 4-5 yellow lights randomly dotted in the sky moving together roughly from the same area I saw the last one, I believe they were in the atmosphere and seemed to be quite close. They just slowly moved in one direction until they went over the front of the house and over the tree line. No sound what so ever.

And about 3 months ago I was at my parents place going for a walk with my mum and the dogs. I saw a cloud streak in the sky from a jet. Looked to the left and there was a silver orb about 100-200 feet above us. I could see the reflection of the sun in the metal of the craft. (They definitely use something way more sophisticated than metal lol). Told my mum to look and that officially became her first UFO sighting (she was pretty sceptical before, plus her reality without ET's existing was pretty set in stone). We were pretty close to a fence we were walking by at that point, so we only saw it for a brief few seconds before the fence got in the way. Walked past the fence and it was gone. It would have only been about 2 seconds it was out of view. Either it somehow dematerialised, cloaked itself or moved at absolutely absurd speeds for it to be gone that fast. Nothing we have on this planet as far as I know can do anything like that. I also had an assumption the jet may have been sent out to look for it, I could be wrong though.

It only occurred to me super recently that when I was younger (maybe 6-7 years ago) I had probably seen that exact same craft, (or a very similar one) only we were a little further up the same street. I was in the car with mum taking me to school, she was turning into the next street and at the same time I looked up and saw it just sitting there in one place not moving at all. Seemed to be roughly 200-300 feet in the air this time so a little higher that time. Once again I only saw it for a brief moment until the roof of the car blocked my vision. Being a kid I made nothing of it and assumed it was just a plane or something, but I always thought about it.

Growing up in a decently religous family my ideas of our reality and the universe we live we're pretty basic (God, Heaven, Hell etc). But after having my incredible experiences and doing some extremely heavy research online for a decent amount of years, I am now a human being with my paradigm completely flipped on how I view our reality, I am beginning to question humanity's place in the universe and what the future looks like for us. I was a little tense and maybe even frightened when my paradigm begane to shift but now (excuse my language) I'm so fucking excited about it. Even if we don't completely understand the intentions of these beings we share this realm with this is the biggest event for our modern society to date and I'm so privileged to be apart of it.

Aside from the copious amount of evidence online and my personal experience, the absolute mind crushing size of the universe is evidence itself that we do not share it alone. And in my opinion if anyone says otherwise, that would have to be the most ultimate final form of stubbornness a human can reach. Humans have lived with their egos for too long. Being sceptical is fine in a lot of areas in our day to day life, but I feel we are far beyond the scepticism of being alone in the universe.

3- Out of all the those organisms only about 1% survived the mega catastrophe 300 million years ago.
 
Everything on earth today is coming from that 1% mouth to anus tract 20 amino acids organisms.

Can you even imagine what would be on earth if organisms made out of 21 amino acids?
Can you even fathom what type of amino acids can be made outside of earth? And what those combos will create?

Conclusion: If abductees/experiencers description of aliens were to be believed, these are the likely explanations:

1- They are human time travelers from near or very distant future.

2- We share similar genetic code.

3- They've created us in their own image.

4- Greys or any humanoid aliens that have been witnessed so far are biological robots/AI.",Aliens from another planet would literally look nothing like us
aliens,"With this topic, a few things I keep seeing mentioned on a regular basis are the ability of aliens (or other non-human entities) to:

1) Render human beings paralyzed / unable to move (except moving eyeballs in some/most instances?).

2) Render human beings unconscious instantly, make them feel very sleepy if they're awake or put them into a deep sleep that resist loved ones attempt to rouse them.

3) Do a ""mind-scan"" where human memories are read/extracted. Victims can actually ""feel"" the aliens probing their minds.

4) Implant ""screen memories"" where there are falsehoods given as to the interaction with the aliens (i.e. aliens appears as loved ones, religious figures, clowns, cartoon figures or something else). Also, able to wipe out memories.

5) Separate the human ""soul"" (or astral body, if that is a d different thing) from the human host and abduct that part of the person, whilst the body remains, then later bring the soul back to the body. In some cases, there is supposed ability swap souls between bodies.

6) Make humans feel various emotions: fear, love, lust, hate etc at will...

7) Communicate telepathically with humans, using a ""language"" which transcends our use of words, sounds and images.

The above are the key ones, though am sure I have left some out. In some cases, the entities use wand like or some other type of device to enable some of the above, but often they seem to be able to do this innately, with hand motions or staring/intent.

Obviously, these are remarkable, frightening abilities - God-like in some sense.

But are humans completely defenseless? Is there a way to counter the above?

Some actions that have supposedly had some success (and failures also) include:

1) Focusing intent and will against the aliens wishes, using affirmations, focused anger, hatred, love etc

2) Calling out to ""God/Jesus etc"", prayer to have the actions ceases (which raises some interesting/scary possibilities as to the nature of these beings if effective)

3) Usage of head coverings (tin foil hat, mylar etc) to stop or degrade the effectiveness of alien actions

4) Using various mind techniques to confuse the aliens.

Any comments from people as to if these techniques have been effective. Maybe in some cases but not all? Any others?",Alleged alien abilities against humans - is there any way to counter them?

We were going to the movies in the next town over and there was a car in front of us. All of a sudden that car stopped so I did too. I was like wtf dude? And my best friend goes ""Erika?!?"" In a really scared voice. I look at her and say ""What??"" She says my name like that again and points up at the sky and there was a giant triangle with yellowish green lights on the points. It was slowly spinning and just hovering there. My friend rolled down her window a little and there was this weird deep electric hum, like you could almost feel it in the air. I screamed and passed the dude in front of us and we skurted to town as fast as we could. We both called our moms and not sure if either believed us but we were hysterical. We didn't even go to the movies. We just sat at Dennys and talked about what we saw.

We are so confused, we don't know what else it could have been. It was HUGE and there are no airports in that area. What would that hum be?

"" Lovato continued, “Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately.”""

What Jacquee Vallee said about UFOS:

"" Vallée proposes that there is a genuine UFO phenomenon, partly associated with a form of non-human consciousness that manipulates space and time. The phenomenon has been active throughout human history, and seems to masquerade in various forms to different cultures. In his opinion, the intelligence behind the phenomenon attempts social manipulation by using deception on the humans with whom they interact.""

Vallée also proposes that a secondary aspect of the UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that it is highly unlikely that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that is exactly what the manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e#cite_note-10) Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.""",Alien deception coming real soon?
aliens,"For about 6 years there is a strange man that I see absolutely everywhere. It started at my old job in a drugstore, he would come in almost daily and “browse” around the isles I would be stocking, he was never looking at the items on the shelves and never bought anything, he would always be side eyeing me and following my every move while pretending to look at merchandise. Other coworkers started to notice this weird mans fascination with me and how suspicious his body language was. One day he entered the department I was working in and was lurking around a lot closer than usual. I gained the courage to approach him and ask if he needed any assistance with the woman’s perfumes he was “looking at”. He was completely taken off guard and looked in distress that I had spoken to him. In a panic he mumbled that he wanted to purchase something, it was the first item in eye shot. I rang him through the till and he appeared so stressed he could barely speak and was trembling. I gained access to his name and information due to him being a member of our loyalty program. When I arrived home that night I immediately looked him up online. I found nothing but a Facebook profile with one photo of him. Other than that there wasn’t a trace of him online. 

For years after I left this job I continued to spot him around town. At my work, around my neighbourhood, any day any time, no matter where I was I would see him. My family and friends were very aware of his existence, I grew very fearful this man was stalking me. After that one interaction we had, he never approached me again, and I never saw him buy anything ever again. I managed to figure out where he was working but it led me to no further information. He was never with anyone, never spoke to anyone, and for the 6 years I’ve been seeing him he’s always worn the exact same outfit, it never once changed. Rain or sun he wore a bomber jacket, black jeans, a yellow t shirt, and converse. His haircut never changes, nothing ever changes. He is very tall, probably 6”5, extremely skinny almost emaciated, and has a very scary face. Very sharp features and very gaunt.

What scares me the most is that every time I see him, he always sees me first. He is always looking right through me. One time I was in the back seat of my parents car. I wasn’t paying any attention until my mom shouts ‘He’s looking at you” I peer out the back window and there he is, crossing the street. Somehow staring right through the black tinted windows of the car, he is looking straight through the car, right into my eyes. There is no logical reason for him to be able to see me. 

He shows up most when I am thinking and or talking about him. There’s been many times where I’ve told someone this story and then he shows up immediately after.

I am someone who experiences a lot of strange “coincidences” and and predicts a lot of things happening. But this feels different. There’s been periods of time recently where I see him every day.

I have spent so much time pondering the possibility that this man really knows my whereabouts and is somehow tracking me, but I find it to be impossible. Most people would call the cops on fear of being in danger and being stalked. That is something I would never do, but I need this to stop.

I come from a family of conspiracy theorists and “mystics”. The main theory is that he is not human, he is an alien, or a guardian angel. Something other worldly with a message to tell me. I have a hard time believing he could be a guardian angel, because he gives me the worst gut feeling, something feels very sinister about him. I am looking for any ideas of what could be going on here.",Who is following me

Since 2017 comparison studies have been made as part of VASCO program and scientists identified over a 100 stars that cannot be seen anymore. Most of these could be explained by some natural phenomena, but for missing 9 stars explanation has not been found. Most interestingly, all these stars are located in an extremely narrow part of the sky.

What’s quite unusual is that the magazine and the scientists involved in the project seem to take seriously the possibility that this disappearance is due to an advanced civilization (hypothesis include dyson spheres and very large space vessels in the solar system in 1950).

Decades later doctors discovered an anomalous metal fragment. There are a lot of details I was able to find about this case but the one thing I haven't found yet is what exactly happened during the abduction. He goes into great detail about before and after but I haven't heard anything about what was done to him aside from it was ""terrible"". 

One thing I find really interesting about this case is for the vast majority if the time he has told this story he was convinced these grey beings were evil, but I saw a recent interview where he said his view on this has softened. I wonder if that's due to him realizing that his views of the events may have been distorted by his absolute terror at the time.

aliens,"I believe mankind’s strongest evolutional trait is our ability to adapt to pretty much whatever the hell is thrown at us. I mean, as a species. We figured out how to eat pretty much anything, and adapted to that. We voluntarily (?) moved to some of the hottest/coldest/harshest environments this world has to offer and just went with it. We wage insane wars with each other but still, the vast majority of mankind just goes on with their life. Disease, historic scientific discoveries, the internet, airplane travel, global crisis after global crisis. Covid is a great example of this. Many have died and there’s been a lot of issues everywhere but for the general public it will be like “yeah the early 2020s were kinda crazy, we all wore masks, stayed at home and many people died but that was pretty much it”. Now with the great reveal hopefully on the way, I see a lot of sentiment along the lines of “people’s minds will be blown, society will collapse” etc, but just look at all that came out publicly the past months and people are like “meh, gotta pay my bills, jerk off, play some games”. 

I may very well be wrong but let’s say every suspicion proves to be correct, we have some epic conferences with the galactic federation, get some new tech but for some reason that’s it and we’re left alone to continue walking on our own path of fate, no invasions or unpluggings of the matrix and so on.

A couple of generations from now, with people who were born after the revelation, it will more or less be “gtg to work, get laid, eat something” for the most part. Same old. Kind of like children today taking iphones and the internet for granted and 100% non-revolutional.

Since covid its almost nightly. But you can search my profile to see info on my sightings. This post is all about my parents because its different and havent read similar sightings.

So my dad is from cusco, peru. In the 60s he worked on the family coffee plantation in the Amazon jungle. Acres on acres of farm land. At the time you had to take a truck to nearest road then trek about 14 hrs on foot to get to plantation. Keep in mind this is the 60s in a third world country. My dads helpers were indigenous and have never even seen planes in the sky, which is very important. 

So one day, my parents were out in mid day and see what they describe as glass ball zooming across the sky. Its close enough to them that they can describe it as glass. (I myself have seen a metallic ball midday, but it was pretty high so not 100% sure it was metallic so interesting that they saw something even closer to the ground) anyways, they swear it was made of glass or transparent material  and looked similar to a decahedron  more so than a ball. So after this sighting they go back to their workers which are on other side (remember these are acres) of plantation, and ask them if they saw anything fly by. (Remember these ppl have never even seen planes). They said they saw the same thing my parents saw. A ball made of glass. It landed. Two small humans came out. Both had black dog heads with pointy ears. Anubis?

My parents were in shock and went along with their lives. Multiple workers described the same beings. No reason workers would lie and they all said same thing. Besides in Egyptology are there any other sightings of anubis like beings?",My parents experience with UAP's/beings in Peru

I think there allot of things the USG can disclose about UAP/UFO/USO/fast walkers/slow walkers/drones without going into classified information, (giving away sources or methods).  This is my first draft to my wish list.

1. Give a chorological timeline of all confirmed/high probable UAP/UFO/USO sightings, reports from start to present

2. Give a list of all known performance and characteristics that have been observed or recorded.

3. List of all intrusions, interactions, known sightings or any other involvement with UAPS/USO/UFO

4. Confirm if they do or don’t have materials, bodies or have never interacted with aliens

5. Confirm or deny if nuclear facilities, ships or subs have been shut down or inhibit in anyway.

6. List of international efforts involving UAP/UFO/USO interactions, studies, coordination or assistance

7. List of all U.S. personnel that have lost their lives or have been injured due to suspected UAP/USO/UFO or “drone” interactions

8. Replies (Confirmation/Negative replies) from NASA, NSA, FBI, NRO, DIA, CIA, NSA and other government agencies that may have knowledge of this topic. If so, they should provide an unclassified report detailing all reports, emails and other data collected

9. Release all unclassified images, satellite photos, radar returns, electronic emissions data, and other data I can’t think of. Provide classified data to congress

10. Confirm or deny if there is/or ever has been an active USG/international disinformation or counter-intelligent campaign against the public involving the UAP/UFO phenomenal. 

11.  Chronologically list all  USG/private agencies that have been setup to study this phenomenal.

We are progressing in technology at an exponential rate and in terms of Galactic timelines are a blink of an eye from traveling between stars and maybe even galaxies. It took us a hundred thousand years (roughly) to go from fire and stone tools to copper and bronze. Tens of thousands of years passed between the bronze age and the iron age. Generation after generation lived and died using basically the same tools, weapons and processes that their ancestors did. It was then only thousands of years to get to the electric age, and decades to oil and the automobile. In basically 150 years we've gone from horse and buggy to manned flight, rockets to the moon, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering and the Cybertruck.

aliens,,Italian UFO/UAV type classification chart
aliens,"Ever since I was little I have had these really intense dreams of an “alien invasion.” I would see the whole sky lit up with what looks like hundreds of space craft. It was always super ominous and scary and I felt this fear as if they were coming to look for me and I would try to hide. I have always had a visceral fear of aliens especially the greys. A fear that I can’t explain and didn’t understand. I think I have been abducted but have no memory except for the lingering fear. When I was 13, I started to get deep into the conspiracy world and trying to find out as much info I can about aliens. 

There was one particular dream that was really odd! I had it a few years ago. 
In the dream it was announced to the world that aliens will be visiting and checking everyone. You had to pass their “test?” I wasn’t sure what the test was exactly but in the dream one by one each person had to walk up to the aliens and they would simply “scan” you and if you pass you are gucci but if u dont pass they vaporize you (to my understanding). So before their arrival I was freaking the fuck out because I didn’t want to get vaporized and also I was scared shitless that they were coming soon lol i remember being inside a supermarket looking for something to help me (loling at my dream self XD) there was this really tan guy in my dream who was helping me and he was trying to reassure me that everything will be ok. 

At some point I had this orange scented essential oil thing and i was like “HEY EVERYONE PUT THIS ON BEFORE THE ALIENS GET HERE” 
We had to walk across this bridge connected from one spacecraft to their spacecraft. We were on some kind of tall platform. We meet the aliens and I think they were hooded or I couldnt see their face. But I wanna say their skin was green? The aliens communicate via telepathy and they said I passed THANK THE LORD!!! Then the dream kinda just ended there. 

My most recent dream was a few days ago. I look up at the night sky and I see what looks like a brilliant meteor shower but the light was like 1000x brighter than a regular meteor shower. It was absolutely mesmerizing! Immediately i fell to the floor and like blacked out. Felt like i was paralyzed. This dream I didn’t feel any fear. I think I blacked out because I wasn’t ready to see something. So that was weird!

aliens,"Im not an abductee but Im fascinated by the subject and I have read 200+ reports from documented sources. I've noticed patterns of reports, which can be split into 3 categories: 


1. Random happening upon an entity or entities that seem to be surveying their surroundings. Mostly physical, sometimes interdimensional. Friendly chats or invitations, sometimes no verbal communication but witnesses do not feel threatened or coerced, sometimes entities are non biological (robots).


2. Feelings of being followed or watched, night or day time abduction, sometimes willing, often forced, memory wipes, surgeries, messages relayed of eco disasters, classic ""Gray"" encounter but sometimes involve handful of recurring species.


3. Random bizarre encounters that follow no pattern, mostly physical sometimes interdimensional often involving animal like cryptids, single or in groups, mostly no communication or message of bad intent, physical or mental attacks, witnesses are targeted but pattern seems to follow an area rather than an individual.


I'm summarizing and am trying to get everything under an umbrella of patterns here. If the universe is infinite, then there would be an infinite number of intelligent life forms, and not all encounters could be attributed to one alien ""race"". Also, the universe is vast, so one race would not necessarily invest a lot of resources coming to Earth* (unless it brings them more resources than it takes)


Also, advanced technology does not always mean advanced culturally, as can be seen on earth throughout our history. A species can stagnate, even for millions of years, without outside influence.
There are some questions that keep popping up as to motives and the nature of alien life which I think we can answer with logic. 


The 1st type encounter seems to be explorers who recognize us as intelligent beings and respect our place on this planet. The witness is sometimes offered a tour of the craft or even their home planet. Samples of Earth are collected seemingly as curiosities only. Alien beings say they are a peaceful people who keep to their own planet and do not wish to get involved in other planet affairs. 
Robotic beings make sense in this too, wouldn't humans send robot explorers first as well? I think a lot of these beings do fear us, so sending a robot to explore to any inhabitad planet makes more sense from a safety standpoint.
These are usually one off encounters, but there are some reports of friendships continuing for years.


The 2nd type is well known and well documented but not well understood. Some enounters are benevolent, yet they can be confusing. Many benevolent encounters eventually become malevolent. These encounters are an ongoing phenomenon for an individual. Usually never just once.
The same questions keep popping up in my mind. Why, despite seemingly able to stop time do they seem to be rushed and have limited time for an encounter? (Perhaps they only stop the perception of time? Which might be why they say we do not understand time, relying on the sun and clocks might be primitive, they could have internal biological clocks which are good no matter where in space you are)
Many predictions of Earth disasters, most of which witnesses did not live to see come true. Demanding respect of resources yet do not respect the autonomy of human will. Some offered to give tours of home planet, zero reports of someone returning from such a trip.


Reports of small greys being subservient to other beings. Small greys not always doing a good job and sometimes leading to the death of a witness. Not answering questions or giving conflicting answers. Witnesses die unusually young (under 60yrs) despite being told they are cared for medically by greys.
Manipulating emotions and confirming whatever belief a witness wishes to believe (Angels, demons, future humans, etc). Why, if they wish peace, do they not announce themselves and make contact, etc?


The 3rd type are the leftovers that could be the opposite of the 1st encounters, beings that would appear as bizarre or animal like forms to us that do not recognize us as intelligent. They may be fearful of us, or they may not and actively want to kidnap or dissect us. May be interdimensional and their thought process could be impossible to understand.


I have experience in the supernatural and from that I can say what the 2nd type races are not. They are physical beings, from this universe, they are not from the future, not simulation masters, do not travel to the past, did not originate on earth, ever. Reptilians might have, but I'll get into that further down.
Earth is not a zoo, nor a nature preserve. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd types are not ""caretakers"" or ""watchers"". The earth is a valuable planet and anyone interfering with it is not, by definition, a bystander. There are reports of other species that do watch or protect earth, but they are not in any reports of landings or abductions (I'm including ""benevolent"" Nordics)


Shadow people are not aliens, they are interdimensional, but barely in our dimension. They are not technological, more like tribal living forms of energy. They might be confined to Earth, or they might be everywhere, but I know they existed before humans.
Do other physical (same as ours) dimensions exist? I dont know, maybe. Do ""other dimensions"" exist with different laws of physics, matter and energy than our own? Definitely. Do they interact? Yup, see weak force gravity. My point being, aliens may be able to cross dimensions, doesn't mean they are native to another one.


Now, to answer some questions with logic, I look to the ""grabby alien model"". It asks ""Are humans early in the universe?"", answering the question why we havent run into other civs yet. Mathematically they prove if ""loud"" aliens existed then they would expand into 50-60% of the universe by now, and that ""quiet"" aliens would never expand, die out, or get taken over by grabby aliens.
Doesn't really prove if aliens exist, but it does say if they do then the only alien civilizations that survive are the ones that expand as rapidly as possible. That's pretty much a law of nature.


There is another source I read that explains that an expanding alien civ does not destroy another, they incorporate it. The universe is vast and resources are limited. You need to make do with what you can get.
Basically it says that the universe is more like Stargate then Star Trek. There are no federations of mutual benefit. Technology can be leapfrogged but culture and morals cannot. Warefare in space is not possible if both parties can warp in any direction in an instant. 
Warfare takes place on planets, like island waystations in a big ocean; but they do not wish to destroy what they wish to conquer and enslave, because that is another jumping off point that is not their home planet. A civ with multiple planets is harder to kill off than one. 
Hence space cold war, no battles, just subversion. The aliens that come to Earth are more like the East India Trading Company. 
How does a group with limited numbers conquer a planet without destroying its riches or alerting them to their enslavement? By getting human allies to do it all for them. No one makes better prison guards than prisoners themselves. Aliens do not see humans as equals or ones to be learned from.
They need workers. I read most species including greys can not survive on earth. Hence they are making hybrids that can. It wouldn't be just one space civ either. There would be multiple competing groups for Earth.
All would protect it from others destroying the prize with weapons, but none that are here are here for altruistic reasons. Little greys are not soldiers, they seem to be the worker drones tasked with a big job.
Like Mcdonalds line cooks doing research, PR, breeding program, etc. They aren't here to save us, they are here to indoctrinate you to being their coworker or even subordinate. They themselves subordinate to higher up species.
Thats why they are friendly to those open to contact and can be called by them. They are looking for willing partners. Many reports of them trying to infiltrate the military. This is why I think disclosure hasn't happened.
The gov met aliens that state peace and cooperation, but are working to integrate the whole planet to their empire. Why would advanced aliens let their ships be recovered by humans long after a crash? To get the humans addicted to the tech. Make it look like the humans got a good deal.
Supposedly they did this for all strong nations on earth. The gov has to work with them and ""allow"" their experimentation in exchange for tech. Trading makes you reliant on the other, especially when you don't know the value you are giving away.


They want to save the earth for them, not you. Humans are needed, but the individual is not special.
They will make us like the drones, which had free will bred out of them. No freedom, no travel, no culture, etc forever. 


*Humans may have been genetically altered in the far past by aliens, but it was not these aliens. Ancient contact follows a different pattern. There may have even been different groups through history. Records of ""battles in the sky"" might attest to this.
(If we have creators) they could have been driven off, replaced, multiple times. Maybe even original greys were conquered and enslaved only recently, going from a passive to an active role here.
*Reptilians could be a conquered race or be forced to live underground. Or created to be the actual soldiers as needed.
*Nordics could have an agenda, they must have their own empire if they can freely come and go on earth enough to pop into peoples bedrooms as well. They do not fear us.


I used alliesofhumanity.org for these conclusions. It answers a lot of questions as to what the universe would be like and what is going on here. The bad news is that the Earth is valuable and others want it and to enslave us. The good news is they are physical and can be killed. They fear us.
Hence why there is want for disclosure in gov but there isn't. The gov is not ready to fight back and non cooperation leads to war, unless we can make a deal with competing civs. The aliens will only disclose when they are ready for the next step in their plan, ie enslavement (which will be passed off as ""willing cooperation"" to competing space civs).

aliens,"Ok guys. As I said before. I believed the human race was a product or experiment of a higher race or species. Well since I made that post a few had sent me links to this website with much more information. As I said there documented ex military personnel who have said species like the Reptillions very much so exist. Well I've learned much more about them and the species we call ""nordics"" or Tall Whites. 

And before I start this. I do have a link I'm newer to reddit but I'll try to make sure it's in there. Or I can give it I have already previously posted just this link. The website and much more info but for now I'm gonna stick with what this guy got out of a interview with a Reptillion. He said he had a friend who claimed he had met one and talked to one. And that prior to this he never believed in aliens or any of this and thought his friend was crazy. Until they set up a meeting and he sat down with the ""being"" and seen she was real and this is what came of it. 

The Reptillions originally evolved into a intelligent species in the what we call the Jurasic Era. They were apart of the dinosaur kingdom long ago and I assume the way we see animals around us. They seen dinosaurs. This gilt reptillion who calls herself ""Lacerta"" which is a name for us to understand cause we can't pronounce thiers. Anyways during that time she says the other species known as the Tall Whites found earth. And at first communicated with thier species and seemed good. It wasn't until later they found out their real intentions. Which was not resources which surprised the Reptillions but the unadvanced ape like species that inhabited the planet. She said she thinks it reminded them of themselves or how they evolved or she assumed. The issue arrises when they wanted to take 10 to 20 thousand of these animals to thier world to excelerate the evolution process 10 fold. Which BTW normal evolution takes much longer time then we think. She says look at the animals on the planet. They have only evolved so little and its been 148 million years from the cataclysmic event. (I'll get to this in a second)

The issue here. Was that the plan for the Tall whites was to advance these ape like beings into intelligence and then bring them back to this planet and let them evolve. Obviously the reptillions have a major issue with this. Since it is thier world. I mind you again this all happens during Jurrasic time periods. What follows is a galactic war between the reptillons and the Tall whites. In which at some point the Tall Whites used some sort of nuclear super Lazer aimed at earth that was what we thought was a asteroid crater was in fact the impact of this super destructive weapon that killed most of all life on this planet almost completely whiping out the dinosaurs and the reptillon species. Only some survived she said. Ones like Sharks, Crocodiles, certain lizards and snakes on some of our ancestors. 

Eventually I believe the rest of the Reptillions burrows into the depths of the earths in oceans and hard to find caves. They built cities inside these huge places. What we wanna call a ""hollow earth"" theory isn't right though. But you get the picture. 

She said that modern humans are not the original humans. But that we are the seventh installment of us. And that we have no prior knowledge of the others. But the fact the pyramids were built by the 5th installment of humans some near 75 thousand years ago. And that the Egyptians only happened to stumble upon them and try to replicate thier own 

This means humans have evolved prior times. Built cities most likely and clearly strictures. She also said most the cave paintings we see were from these older versions of ourselves. 

Now during my research and listening to testimonies from ex military. Some of them claimed there is alien species that live in bases deep within the earth. And they use ships to come out. 

These ships are the white cigar or ""tic tac"" ones Captain David Fravor chased. These ships belong to the reptillons. They also say they have had meetings with us government and even president Eisenhower. Which this is quite creepy as the new American Horror Story literally has a part where Eisenhower meets with the aliens and makes deals for tech. So oddly times AHS. 

Anyways. Let's cover what else was said. She said the war between the Tall Whites and Reptillions ended only 5 thousand years ago. And that we were present for it. But that we were at the time still so unadvanced that we couldn't comprehend what was happening so we written it down as religion and based religious stories about it. And that much of the Bible includes parts of this and thier kind. But thier kind is seen as the ""serpent"" the evil race. Because the race that created us and started this war lead us to believe they were the evil ones. 
Now it's getting interesting huh? Trust me. I know. Take it for what you will. But I before reading this interview. Knew that reptillons were considered one of the species visiting earth. Little did I know that this was actually their planet first. 

So she was asked why there was no skeletons of them or what not but are ones of dinosaurs. She said that there is but that our scientists kept putting them in the form of a ""reptile"" instead of what would be a humanoid bipedal intelligent being and that not only that but most museums have inaccurate representations of many of the dinosaurs. And even some completely made up ones. And that even some of thier bones were used to help create the Iquandon creatures skeletons and that neither were connected. 

She also says that the sums rays make them smarter. Heats up thier blood and even gives them what we would consider a sexual arrousel stimulation. But since they've been forced into the depths of earth they use artifical sunlight which isn't as good but they basically lost the war on this planet. 

She called us the Tall Whites Zoo experiment. And that's what we are. (Since I was little I always pondered this being the actual origin of our species) and at points during the interview she clearly sees the need to talk down on us. As we're inferior especially in the mental aspect of things. 

They have mind techniques. Telekinesis, telepathic and so forth. Also a thing called Mimicry were they can project a image in our heads to make themselves appear human to us. To blend in. And that it's easier then normal because the Tall Whites or Nordics put capacitors in our minds and switches to do so. So that both species could stay undetected while we evolved as much as possible. 

They eat things similar to us. And she even said she loves surface fruits like apples and oranges the most. 

She states her species before us when living on the surface was already galactic. Made homes on the moon. Mars. Moons of Jupiter and so forth. 

She says humans are very behind in the mental aspect of the universe and conscious. But that her species isn't even that great compared to many of the other species that visit earth. 

The interviewer asked how many species is there visiting or staying here? 

She said at least 14 from what she can tell. And to not ask him to name them all because much like her species we wouldn't be able to pronounce thier names and that her kind can only pronounce 6 of them and not the other 8

And that's so far what I've covered. I'm about halfway along in this interview. And going to read more. 

As I said. I'm skeptical. Yes. But I do know that reptillons have been named as one of the species by humans. And that means there's a high chance this is a real interview. 

What questions I'm left with. Is how to feel. Because I had already come to the conclusion myself we must have been produced by more intelligent beings. Now evolution can create intelligence. But it takes much more time then previously thought and that our evolution has been around 2 million years. When all animals we see have only evolved that far in 148 million years. 

Our process was jump started by the nordics. Why? Idk. Not only that but if this is true we are not the 1st. Or 2nd. Or 3rd or 4th or 5th or even 6th. But 7th version of human. Like we are some new iPhone that comes every 15 thousand years. 

Were the cromags? Neanderthal? And others alike the other versions?

The pyramids being built by an older ones much longer ago. I assume the Spynx as well. Which BTW not long ago it was discovered the sphynx had decades of water erosion damage. What does that mean? That it was built not in a time of dessert. But rainforest. Which putting that knowledge with this interview. Means it truly was made something like 75 thousand years ago. When the terrain was much different because of the tectonic plates.  

I'm not done studying. Learning. I'm gonna be making one of these on the nrodics and what they are like and how they had hands in our religions. But also I think these are ""our"" creators. 

If you ever watched Ridley Scott's prometheus movie I believe it was. They were looking for thier Devine creators. And found them and they were like very tall light skinned humanoid things. I feel it feels something like that to me now. 

I feel the world as we know it. Us as we know it. Is much wrong. Much a lie. And the reptillion said parts of government know of them and thier species. But that it's a good thing that we don't know of thier kind. 

And she reiterates that many times during the interview. That's why the developed tech to hide thier craft and use thier minds to hide their true self. 

But why? Is it in threat or the nordics? What about the other 12 species occupying us ? She claims there are 8 I believe that are forms like us. Physical. 1 from a ""bubble"" and 3 from what she called a different ""plane of existence""

All I'm saying. Is if this is what the government knows. It is starting to make sense for the secrets. At the same time we need to get this over with and out in the open. I get it. I'm still not understand myself how to digest this knowledge. Or what to do with it. 

Dr Steven Greer said our US government is plotting a false flag operation with the back engineered crafts we man made to unite the world in a war against these aliens. And to make the aliens seem like a threat. 

And thay reptillons have been in talks with us about the part they would play In this galactic war. 

This is scary territory. Maybe why the whole needs to be secret has happened. Cause this is talking of galactic travel. Space wars. (Which we created space force for) and the revealing of our true nature. Now remember we were only excellerated evolution. I believe our ancestors would have evolved. If givin the millions or billions of years it took. But we are engineered into intellect. 

This is what I've gathered. I started with all yjr eye witness testimonies from Greers work with ex military and eye witness accounts. And now this link. And so much makes sense to me. Though I'm skeptical of it. I can see now we have lived a sheltered existence and life. 

Not only that but consciousness is so much more important then tech and so much more deep then we can can fathom. And the truth is we are inferior to every other species with these abilities. 

Mind over matter takes on a whole new meaning for me now. Our conscious never dies it just goes into another Astral plain

Also. You know how people who lose limbs have what's called phantom limb syndrome? That's because thier spiritual form still has the missing limb. It's only the physical body that is missing it. Interesting stuff indeed. The reptillon also said in our early versions they were referred to as gods. Seprents. And that our race looked up to them and that many of the incas and myan cultures knew about these creatures because they traveled in these caves in Mexico. She said that they use technology to cover the doors in the caves that lead to their world. And If you ever find yourself in one know your in very big trouble. 
Another thing. Somewhere in the website I read about it was these reptillons thay created what we think of as ""mythical"" creatures. The centaurs, mermaids, half human half lizard serpents and so forth. 
That mermaids very much do exist in the deepest depths of the oceans. They stay far from us for what I can only assume is because they see how we treat the oceans and creatures within it. How we kill them endlessly for little gain. Poison the waters with oil etc... so these mermaids have chosen to delve deeper into the ocean.

aliens,"I was watching the finale of AHS: Death Valley &amp; it honestly creeped me tf out. The grey aliens, I’ve seen one. It literally makes me fucking cringe everytime I watched the show &amp; saw one of those fuckers. I was probably 16 or 17, not quite sure about my exact age. As if that even matters. My cousin was with me. He lived in Swink, CO with his family and I lived in Rocky Ford, CO. If you’ve ever been around this area, you know it’s small &amp; and on the way to Swink it smells of nothing but cow shit for miles.Because there’s a cow farm obviously. There’s dirt roads and a lot of fields. So anyways. One night my mom told me I could take my cousin home but because I didn’t have a license to take the back roads. Well I remember the corn field being on the right, the passenger side. We went past a 4 way stop and got to the middle of the road when something just fucking walks right out of the field. Gets to the center and just stands there still and stared at us. It had big black eyes (I’ll never forget the eyes), definitely greyish blackish darkish skin, also shiny, tall, but average size. I don’t remember it being this super skinny six feet type of thing though. It was very average size. We were freaked the fuck out and of course asking each other what the hell are we looking at? What do we do? My cousin told me to turn around. Back up and turn the fuck around. It stared at us, like basically trying to intimidate us to do that too. So as soon as the car started going in reverse it just simply walked right back into the field where it came from. Just like that it was gone. I’ll never forget that shit. It was terrifying looking at something you can’t fucking explain and you can’t really talk about because people will look at you like you’re a lunatic. I don’t talk to any of my biological family anymore but if I did, I wish I could talk to him about this. I remember it so vividly like it happened tonight.

Apart from an incident at a castle which I find hard to explain I’ve never seen an apparition or come across a Bigfoot. Extraterrestrials are more plausible because of how vast the universe is so I can get my experience a little bit more.

I was staying with my grandparents one evening when it happened. My grandad and I had just finished up watching a tv episode and he went to go get a drink, or something I can’t remember exactly what. I opened the patio door and stepped into the garden and it was a gorgeous night, sun was setting and there where only a few clouds dotting the sky. I was just staring upwards and noticed a small white light travelling quickly across the sky, I at first attributed it to be an airplane, but questioned that when it stopped completely. It was very high in the sky, like I said it was just a white dot like a star in the night sky. But it stopped midair and I didn’t know any planes that could do that. After a few seconds of it sitting motionless in the sky, it shot upwards incredibly fast and disappeared from view.

I’m not 100% convinced it was a UFO, but I know it wasn’t a plane or any other man made aircraft cause the ones I know of can’t stop mid-flight and shoot upwards into the sky.

A small blue dot, so far away  
little did we know how long we would stay.  
As we got closer we began to slow,  
what would this world be like little did we know.

Our ship was so big it looked like a moon,  
and we would be down and make contact very soon.

We were in trouble we needed a new place.  
We were the last surviving members of the Martian race.

Our planet had got hot so hot it turned red,  
the water dried up, it was dead.

We landed on the morning of our first day,  
it wasn't perfect we knew that on the way.

The Sun would burn us and the gravity would hurt our bones,  
but this blue planet would be all our new homes.

As days turned into weeks and weeks into years,  
and after lots of blood and tears,  
we slowly began to forget where we had once been from  
and the original landing party was only remembered in legend and song.

Zeus, Apollo, Odin, and Thor  
were remembered as gods forevermore,  
and when we look up at the Moon shining down today  
we have all forgotten that that was the ship that traveled from so far away.

And now today as we look up,

we look for beings from other places

Why try to describe a tree to a friend when you can just “be” the tree, and share what it's like to be a tree.  Their language of sharing “being” with one another could be infinitely more complex than our verbal language.

This is also how they could “telepathically” communicate with all things. They can share instantaneous states of “being” messages.

They could be literally “higher” than us in the flow of reality, and could perceive more of it by just being whatever they want to focus their attention on.",How “higher evolutionary intelligences” could perceive reality.
aliens,"Here’s another theory.  However, it’s kinda dark but curious to know what your theories are about aliens and the reality we seem to share with these supposed entities.  

After several experiences with salvia divinorum (psychoactive plant) I was left with the strong feeling that this reality we are a part of is not “real” in the material sense of the word.   That possible our consciousness is dormant, occupied,or captivated in a manufactured reality.   
Not unlike us  humans holding cattle captive behind fences so we can control and use them for a purpose.    
(Very matrix like. I know ). 
Now say for example whatever is holding us captive in this reality needs to send in their AI to adjust/patch script so certain events occur, update code or alter/accelerate certain genetics so particular genes express?.    Almost like scientists or doctors  who work on the code of the simulation from within the game.   They pop into the simulation, do work, make adjustments and pop back out.

Most of these cases involve specific organs being removed. Reproductive organs, the tongue, sometimes eyes, rectum, usually soft tissue organs and blood. 

The weird extraction that people always ask questions about, missing tissue and sometimes bone around the jaw. 

I'd look at from a surgeon's point of view, if you were doing heart surgery, you're going to cut through ribcage to do proper work. Now, pretend you're an apethetic surgeon from somewhere absent of moral, and want to remove an entire tongue in one piece. .

You're going to slice a chunk of a face off to get to it easier, because it's easier and you don't like to waste time. You do these things quick without really thinking about it, because your job is to remove that tongue intact from its root.


TL;DR: Faces are just barracades for tongues, they don't really care about the flesh or bone surrounding it, they just want it removed in one whole clean piece. (Opinion)","The most simple reason why parts of jaws/facial tissue are removed in mutilation cases, if they aren't hoaxes."

aliens,"Remember when the board wasn't filled with random baseless assumptions of ET/UFOs, Fox News figures (Lue Elizondo, Tucker, everyone else venerated by this community), and most of all, when moderators weren't deleting non-grainy videos? Has this been taken over by shills and glowies or am I mistaken?

To be honest the golden age of this subreddit started around Late 2020 (aka November/December), when all of the ""disclosure"" discussions bloomed from the guy who said a galactic federation exists and work with the U.S and Israel Government, several interesting things had happened afterwards.

There was a guy (on the r/conspiracy subreddit) who said a close friend who works for NOAA had told him some sort of big revelation about aquatic aliens (and others occupying this planet) was going to definitely happen this year, though they didn't specify a date, and the post later got deleted.

Later on, trump had signed a UFO Disclosure bill which spread many exciting rumors among this community and other alien-themed subreddits.

Then this is when the famous Throawaylien story started getting momentum and attention, due to all of the stuff that's been happening during that time, people thought ""that can't be a coincidence, something *must* be happening!"", which, sadly never came into fruition as he said (he did say there was a change of plan on his last post though, perhaps it was because of that?)

The Pentagon started deliberately ""leaking"" and confirming sightings on the media afterwards, this had created suspicion that there was going to be a project blue beam of some sort, due to the general mistrust of the government.

And then? When the very disappointing report came out, everything started going downhill, throawaylien didn't happen, several other larpers came out and were found to be frauds, the community got extremely skeptical of everything because of those events.

So in my opinion, I feel like most things that happened were a psyop to hype up truth-seekers, UFO enthusiasts and the like only to be let down to the bottom, making people lose interest in this subject, which in turn made this a win for the disinformationalist government.",Why is this subreddit not interesting anymore?

aliens,"Assumption 1. I always imagine UFOs scan all the consciousness around to get a deeper picture of what is going on around. Kind of like how we use infrared to see the heat of metabolism around the helicopter, they scan brains to experience the mental landscape around the UFO. In addition, all kinds of information that we would scan if we could, like generic makeup and disease.

Assumption 2. The cattle they are mutilating are in bad shape, physically or mentally. And we don't allow for any natural selection that would screen these individuals out of the population. If left to be, we would just breed them so that more and more of the population would have the same genes. 

Assumption 3. If the cow is somehow bad for the mental landscape, maybe they feel sorry for it or it's negatively impacting their ideal environment because of a genetic variation, then it makes sense to stop it's procreation.

Potential clue: The organs that get removed may signal the reason for the mutilations, we are just too dumb to get it. Removing reproductive organs:- don't want it to reproduce. Removing eye:- don't want offspring to inherit eyes. Basically they may be acting like substitute predators because we neglect that role and accumulate weaknesses in our food source because we don't act like normal predators. Not to say that they aren't doing it with other life forms, but we just aren't noticing because genetic decay is way more common i cattle because of the aforementioned reason.

It could be spontaneous because they see something on their way to whatever, like humans rehabilitating a bird with a broken wing, or it could be systematic, maybe helping evolution stay on a certain path. If so, one could speculate what else they might be doing in related ways. Not that there aren't plenty of explanations for how we are doing it to ourselves, but another explanation for why human fertility is steadily decreasing might be that they see we are hurting the biosphere due to overpopulation.

Or they might drink organ juice on special occasions, who knows?","So about cattle mutilations, here is another hypothesis that's probably not true either but makes sense."

aliens,"Operating Assumption number 1:

The one common thread I keep seeing, that I hope would be the building block to build upon is the fact that most posts and comments refer to developing a higher human Consciousness, or something along those lines, call it what you will.

Let's suppose aliens don't exist... is it such a bad thing for humans to have improved their game? That's the absolute worst thing that could happen, and it would be an actual blessing. So, why not operate on that assumption?

Aside from humans becoming better, let's look into other viable operating assumptions about aliens. Here is a proposed list that crosses my mind: Are aliens biological or machine-based or spiritual life-forms? How long have they been aware of earth and humans? What is their intent? Is it an assumption that they have superior technology? I know that these questions may seem a bit basic, but why not answer them, codify them, and then extrapolate from there, so everyone has a basic frame of reference to work from? Just a proposal, and Yes, I would be willing to put the actual time and effort into organizing and coordinating this sort of thing, unless someone else is totally and passionately all about it.

Thank you :)",Standardization of beliefs... because there is no such thing
aliens,"I've delved far into this alien/consciousness thing lately. As someone who didn't believe the human mind was capable of things like remote viewing. Moving things. Telepathic abilities and so forth. The existence of these aliens and the clear fact everyone whose encountered them has said they talk telepathically. 

It has opened my eyes to what the true possibilities are of consciousness. And then I also found myself thinking the further we go down the road of tech. The more disconnected we become from ones inner self. 

And this is why I think depression is so widely happening now. Think about this. Before all this tech. Before the TV. Phones. Gaming systems. Computers. We were a species who was forced to spend time and interact with the world. With existence state upon the stars and wonder of glory. Shoot now days with all the cities it's hard to see stars at all... And with these toys we have created alternate worlds to interact with. Screens. Games. Simulators. Etc... and almost every human being does it extensively now days. Phones are used at least 5 to 6 hours a day on average. Not counting TV and games. Kids now days spend all day on these devices and barley interact with the actual existence they reside in. Along with the fact movies and shows are just acting out fake realities in which we put our attention and conscious towards. Sadly another way of disconnecting from true reality. By delving into a fake one. 

All this I believe is unnatural to us. And our state of being. 

Another thing I thought about. Is how we're told we only use like 20 percent of our brains? Why is that?  You don't think that there's not a way to unlock the other 80%? And what that other 80 percent is capable of. Only reason I could think why we can't. Is something has put a limit on our consciousness or it's capacity. Besides that it might be as simple as mind over matter. 

The old fashioned I don't know it's suppose to be impossible. So I made it probable scenario. If we are not taught. And trained. And forced to believe we can't do greater things with our minds. Then we just might have evolved by now to a higher level through that conscious state of being. 
It's only cause we're told what restrictions we have. We're told things are not possible so we therfore let it be that way. When in all reality. If we set aside ego and pride. And focused on our conscious. I believe people just might be able to do what we think is impossible. It wouldn't be the first time we were told something was impossible only to have it not be. 

Share your thoughts. Do you think our love for technology and our impatience has created our own diconnect from one's true self? Is this why mental illness and self hatred and depression seems to become a massive pandemic in itself? I truly think these things correlate. And I worry the more we spend time, money, effort creating things in which to disconnect us. We may never change in time to be the great beings we are capable of being.",2 paths of evolving. One being spiritual and spirituality. The other being technology. And I think the natural one is spirtualness. And I think tech has disconnected us so badly from our conscious true self. That is why we see massive depression across the world. We're becoming disconnected..
aliens,"We sit here and debate the topic of ""aliens"" and what they are and what they mean. But let's break this down fundamentally shall we. 

We humans see this universe in a certain light and perception which has been very limited by our scope of never having traveled very much in it. That which we do not understand we are quick to dismiss, object, ridicule, fight against and so forth. 
When we think of aliens we instantly think ""scary creatures"", monsters, predators and those which were made in movies. When the true reality is a alien species is no different then when Europeans traveled across the ocean and discovered native Americans and America. Think about this. It's just on a much larger and longer away scale. 

But why do we suspect and expect these aliens to be scary? I'm sure cause we don't know thier intentions. Or more so thier capabilities. That fear of the unknown was what drives us to be hostile and trigger happy. 

When truthfully just cause these things may be on a higher level of conscious. Or advanced enough to travel the stars and so on. Doesn't mean they are not most likely a lot like us. They probably have families. People they care for and love. Dreams. Aspirations. Goals. They work and explore and are curious. All things we very much are. I'm not sure why we expect them to be so different when it comes to these fundamental parts of existence. They probably have male and female counter parts. 

Let's look the best we can on the other end of the spectrum. Imagine your them. You've met many species and traveled many stars. Realizing all essence of life is very much alike. It may look different on the outside. But it functions the same. They see us as ""normal"" because they have been there done that already. Meaning I'm sure we are not the first encounter they have had with another higher level conscious life form. 

Maybe they don't make art, music, movies like we do and they find those things incredibly interesting. I also wonder how they perceive our sports like football. A sport focused on running full speed and recklessly throwing our bodies around into one another for a game to win. I figure they find it primitive to say the least. 

Why? Because when you think of it. What does it take for a species to evolve? To advance enough to be intergalactic travelers. Well 1 thing I believe is having peace and harmony on thier planet. They evolved past a point of ""war"" and ""competitiveness"". They dropped thier egos and pride to develope themselves consciously further. 
Humans have huge egos. Too much pride. We always have to be RIGHT. We always wanna win and prove we're better then the opposition. A good example of this is US, Russia, and Chinas militaries. All it really is. Is a dick measuring contest. To see who can create the bigger weapons and better techniques and technology over one another faster. And in doing so there's so much ""secretive"" learning going on. Meaning when one country discovers something big. They refuse to share it with any others. And this is where pride and ego become issues. 

Imagine. The US, Russia and China and every other government was transparent and 100% willing to share every break through. Every discovery. Every newly created life bettering object or medicine. Imagine these governmental entities instead of trying to one up one another. Helped one another go up instead. We don't have to have the same ideals. Rules and laws and beliefs to want humanity as a whole to progress further. We can stay unique. Different cultures and beliefs and still thrive as a whole or world. 

These are the things I imagine these alien species have accomplished. And I figure there are 2 paths a civilization can go. 1. Continue to be destructive, creating bombs for war, being top secret about everything. Use war to generate money and build your economy. Cause that's what we're doing. Inciting war for wealth and resources. We're a species built of war. Since the dawn of time the first thing we did once things become even remotely established was made swords and sharpened then for war. And then waged full on battles piling up bloody bodies along the way. For what? Land? Resources? Wealth? Personal gain? Fame? To guess what. Feed our egos and pockets. 

The other path one can go. Is synchronization. Meaning we all learn to love and care for each other. We put our minds, resources, talents together as a whole to better earth. You gotta realize once the truth fully comes out that aliens are definitely here. It means that no longer are our squabbles on earth so important. And it becomes clear that to prosper. We can't divide humanity so much. Instead of bring it together. Yet when you look around all you see is division. And much of it is purposely created by our own government and other governments. 

Social media is used like a tool. Think there's billions on fb every day. Many who just read headlines or links or fake posts and re post them thinking it's fact or real. When it's truthfully misleading and damning. 
Trust me on this. The US government wants division. Not only in the public BUT IN THEMSELVES AS WELL. that's how I know this. That's how our government works. They segregate everything and everyone. That way no 1 person has the whole story or puzzle. Only 1 piece per each. This is how they keep secrets secret. And when leaks do happen it's only a small portion of a much larger picture. 

And honestly. As long as people inside governments feel the need to lie. Deceive, create false narratives. Spreads misinformation on purpose to create divide. We will never evolve to the next step. We will never get better. It will always stay the same. 

My point. Was that we need to perceive these aliens differently. Not as some entity that's completely different then us or that which we know. But more likely a lot like us. Or was like we were a long time ago. If they were hostile they would have been long ago. Hostility is thier last concern. But our hostile nature is a main concern for them. Not only for themselves and thier well being. But in general we're a threat to ourselves and our existence. Atom bombs are not needed. Not wanted. And never should have been made. We gotta make a change people. We need to steer away from conflict and war. And go towards continuity and care. Science and progress. Spirituality and morality. 

These aliens. Didn't get to where they are. By destroying one another. Using up all the fossil fuels on thier planet while destroying its atmosphere. They didn't make it this far building weapons of mass destruction and focusing only on things that kill. 

We need to be better. As humans.","What we call ""Aliens"" are just living members of our universe. Just like when Europeans crossed the ocean and found Native Americans. Sure it's A different culture, Ideals and beliefs. But same lively process, feelings, families, and care for each other."
aliens,I've read a few people say that aliens are here because they noticed us using an atom bomb. How would that work? Every star is a fusion bomb so how could they pin point a few atom books going off? Always wondered the logic behind this thanks for the help guys!,Why do people say atom bonds are why they found us
aliens,"Hello, just wanted to share my personal thoughts.

Throughout history, the human race has been incredibly savage, violent, and uncaring of itself and the planet. Let's say, hypothetically, that the UFOs and things being seen by our military and by civilians are from extra terrestrial beings.   


What if they're here because they recognize how dangerous we are as a species? What if it comes down to us being the species that colonizes and destroys foreign worlds purely so it benefits us? What if that's just our place in the universal ecological system?   


If that's the case, then I will whole heartedly embrace such a fate.",Necessary Evil
aliens,,Ancient Aliens DEBUNKED
aliens,"I for the past couple months have been doing some intense researching and studying on this topic. I realize if someone is an average believer in UFO's they most likely will think the basics. Roswell happened. We recovered crafts and aliens. And that's about it and that the government is keeping it secret. 

But it goes WAY DEEPER then I ever imagined. And I think most of us who have done our due diligence know that aliens and consciousness are linked on many levels. Along with what may be alternate dimensions and dimensional entities as well. From Geaorge Knapp and Jeremy Corbells research and findings to David Fravor and his sightings to Bob Lazar and then what I think is the treasure trove of info on this subject is what Dr Steven Greer is doing. Now I get that not everyone believes in Greer or is thrown off by the fact he talks about remote viewing, summoning craft with your conscious and other stuff. While we can debate those topics (ones I've found myself now being much more open minded about the ever before)

What's undeniable is the amount of eye witness testimonies he has from top ranking officials for the CIA, DIA, FBI, Pentagon, Area 51 whistle blowers and people who were at REF Goodrich and so forth. If you haven't I HIGHLY suggest you check these out. Many of these people seem highly credible and don't seem to be bullshitting what so ever. This is not a game. This is not a joke this is as real as it gets and from what I've gathered even more ""real"" then real itself. 

Once you start hearing the same reports and info out of several sources not even linked to one another. These people are verifying others with tjier testimonies like Bob Lazar. At this point Bob wasn't lying. S4 definitely exists. Alien aircraft are definitely at area 51. And that seems fact at this point. 

Things I've gathered from multiple people corroborating the same info. 
1. The moon is not what we think it is. And has alien bases on it. And when Armstrong and Aldrin went to the Moon these aliens were there watching us take our first steps. 
2. Mars also has alien bases on it. And the Mars ""face"" they tried to say was just shadows is not. And was made by another alien race.
3. Us government has re-engineered these crafts and are easily mistaken for real ET's. Scary to think about how they could use that in so many ways.
4. There are WAY more then just 1 alien species. Now this is one I have heard many different numbers on. I don't think anyone knows exactly. But I've heard 3 people now say it's at least 35 or more. Maybe even up to 50 or 60... (and at least 5 that are well known being The Gray's, The Nordics, Reptilians, Insectoid looking ones, and the Elders) whose more advanced? Idk. I do believe the Gray's are a artificial biological machine made to survey and keep watch over the human race like a ""drone"" And we're made by the Elders. But I'm not positive. Info is suggesting this though. 
5. There are MANY kinds of ships. Because there are many kinds of species. Interested in us not cause we are so ""interesting"" but because we are destructive. With atom bombs and so forth. I highly feel as we are being watched for our ability to be destructive. I believe we were found by many of the ""other"" species when we detonated these atom bombs originally. We garnered major attention across the galaxy...
6. Besides ""physical"" crafts there are non physical ones as well. These were originally called ""Foo Fighters"" they look like little balls of flame flying around. Not sure of thier purpose or if they are ""craft"" in the traditional sense or a consciousness being. 
7. There seems to be a major interest by the aliens to be closer to us. Abductions are often compiled with the fact these abducties are forced to mate either with another human. Or a alien that projects itself as a human. These same abducties are often re abducted and presented with what look like hybrid versions of a alien/human child offspring. This is fascinating but also terrifying to think about. What is the purpose? Are they blending in with us already ? Controlling our paths and decisions. The mind wonders.
8. The crafts in which these aliens fly seems to also be a conscious entity itself. Many people have described feeling a conscious from them while close or touching them. It's even said that the roswell craft eventually ""died"" when the occupants of that craft died. So maybe the consciousness is thiers? Not sure.
9. They are very interested in our nuclear weapons. They have gone to many nuclear sights and disabled and disengaged nuclear weapons. Clearly the obvious reason is because they are destructive further then we know. It's thier way of saying stop killing your planet and others. 
10. A couple have come out and said there is a galactic federation of these species. Which to me makes sense. Just like there is multiple countries on this earth. So we made up the United Nations to keep peace and talk things out and so forth. It only makes logical sense advanced species would do the same to keep one another In check.
11. Despite most of us not knowing it. The human race has been a galactic traveler for decades already. There are tons of testimonies stating that we've had this capability for a long while. And that the edge of our solar system is only hours away. This was also backed by what Ben Rich said while he was dying which was ""If you've seen movies like Star Trek or Star Wars, Know that we've already been there, done that or figured it was not worth doing anyway"" which is a insanely powerful statement from the ex head of Lockhead And Martin/Skunkworks. 
12. It seems almost all aerospace companies are apart of this. Lockead, Northrop, Boeing etc... they have these crafts. And have had them since most likely late 60's early 70's. 
13. Here's a list of some of the technology we acquired re engineering these crafts. Fiber Optics, Night Vision (the Gray's had ""contacts"" over their large eyes that were night vision tech. The integrated chip or AKA A CPU chip. Which I believe is what powers computers, gaming systems, TVs, and cellphones. This makes sense to me. As not long after roswell these things were ""created"" And also high beam lazers. Now remind you. Each of these technologies we are much less advanced in. Thier versions are much more powerful. But we understood the concepts and created them. 
14. Roswell and many other crashes were due to radar tests happening at the time. For some reason our radars may mess with thier crafts. Roswell was a crash that was of 2 crafts. The second was not found until 1949. Though many more have been located since. No clue how many. 
15. Though this one may have only had 1 source say it. I believe it cause this source had been right on other things. He claims to have been a area 51 doctor. Tasked with dissecting and doing autopsies on multiple alien species. He said there was 2 things we all had in common. 1 being each species was apart of the 5 star form. Meaning 2 arms. 2 legs. 1 head. The other thing we all had in common and this is the kicker... we all shared human DNA with one another.... 

They know they've been around much longer then just roswell. Roswell was just a incident caught by many eyes and the government at first confirmed the report then layer denied it with thier dog and pony show tactics. But the collective out there seems to be these things have been here as long as we have been conious. That they had hands in creating our religions. Beliefs. Rules and systems. Which honestly when you think of the ""strange"" things that happen in the Bible. Think about how these things are not only telepathic but have technologies and consciousness far beyond what we think is possible. And they very much so could have been direct parts of stories from the Bible. The flood. Jesus resurrection. Amd so forth. This is just my theory of possibility here though. 

But when you connect that with how almost every ancient civilization had drawn what seemed to be flying saucers, star people, people coming from the skies and alike. Well it sure starts to make a lot more sense now huh? 

As a kid I always wondered how the human race got to be how we are. And how it happened. And from a young age I came up with 2 possible outcomes. Maybe 3. 1 clearly being evolution. But my issue with that was that there were animals and species long before us that are still here. And they never evolved anything else then survival tactics or techniques. You'd think with all the life and time here that just one other species would have developed consciousness? Yet they hadn't. Unless we talk about the Nieaderthals, Cromags, and others alike. 

The other possibility. Which honestly made more sense and seemed more likely. Was that we were created. Engineered on a biological level. Something that has mastered genetics had implanted or birthed or whatever a conclusion entity which was us. And they probably made the niethnderthals, Cromags and every other cousin of the human race. We were the best version so we survived. As any natural selection process would go. 

Before I started this study and research I didn't think much about it having to do with consciousness. But any real searcher on the topic will come to the fact they are one in the same. Aliens and higher levels of conscious. 

And when you think when humans have these same capabilities? When we can bio engineer a new life form through development of gentics. And fly to a different solar system and pick our a world that's habitable and then release this experiment we WOULD! And we would study them as they evolved. Watched them as they grew smarter and created more structure. As they created music, art, war, life, and everything alike. That's EXACTLY what we would do. We already do these things on this planet decades ago. Experimenting on monkeys, chimpanzees, apes. Dolphins, whales, octopus, squids. Etc... we clone animals. Mess around with genetics. We create experimental environments to watch studies unfold. 

As so with all this knowledge and info. Combined with connecting dots and having just a small amount of common sense. You also might come to the conclusion I have. Which is we brothers and sisters. Are a engineered alien experiment. That's why no other animals are like us. Why we are so unique in the aspect of consciousness. Why we are the only ones that create and build on massive levels. I highly doubt that just ""happens"" it's more likely. That something either jump started or created us entirely of thier own making. 

Maybe we are a mix of all the species? Since they all seem to have human DNA? Maybe it's not human whatsoever. It's actually alien. As many who have ""talked"" with some of these beings. Quite a few said that they told them were related. That they are our ancestors. Along with them saying we need to save our planet and do better on that part. That was also said a a bunch in these encounters. 

Now I 100% get it. That this is extremely hard to wrap your head around. That in fact your very essence is gonna wanna reject this notion. It's a scary reality. Because what do you do with this info? How do we proceed? Do we lose ourselves in finding out ""our"" gods are alien creatures? Does our bases of religion completely crumble under the truth? Especially if the truth is they fabricated these religions? How does it affect our psyche? Will this leave most depressed? Sad. Angry? Will people kill themselves? Feel uncomfortable in thier own skin? 

I guarantee these are the exact worries that the US government is very concerned with and is why they have kept this secret. It's a paradigm shifting truth. It will rattle all we think we know. And challenge what we don't. But I also believe the second we start the process of letting everyone know. We then can finally make the next huge leap in our evolution or path. Which will be to heavily communicate with these species. Understand not only the universe, but how our coniousness works. What we can do with it that we before thunk impossible. And what ultimately is our purpose? Why did they create us? Our we special? Or even less so compared to other species ? That's another problem. Finding out how inferior we are in the universe. Like we're ""behind"" everyone else. 

Again. I get it. Many will deny this. Not believe it. Or find it to hard to want to accept. That's where I'm at on it. I don't know exactly how I'd accept this truth. Truly though? Why would this be any less probable. Any less likely. And any less different frankly then believing some invisible ""God"" created us? It's the same exact concept. A higher being or consciousness made us. It's the same exact conclusion. 

Or let alone those who think it's all just coincidence or random. For all we know this 3D world we perceive isn't even the normal reality most entities live in. Our conscious mind created a reality that was physical for itself to live in. To understand. 

I also believe the further we use technologies to develop the more disconnected we become from the natural universe and our conscious minds. I believe much of what we achieve with tech could have been achieved with our minds long ago. But as long as we say things are ""impossible"" they will stay that way. And as long as we let our egos and pride control us. We can't transcend to higher conscious...

There you have it. Hundreds hours of research. Reading. Searching. Listening. Detailing. And connecting dots from 1 testimony to another and having them corroborate one another without even knowing of each other. 

This makes the most sense to me. Do what you will with it. Don't believe it. Ignorance is bliss and that's why it's a long time saying. I figure some of us rather stay in ignorance then be ""enlightened"". Do you want the world as you know it to stay this way? War torn. Food shortages. Death. Trapped on a planet that could die or be destroyed... or would you be willing to accept the truth. Take the next step in this process and further our species. Our kind. And be one with the ""aliens"" remember the second we travel to another planet we are the ""aliens"". So it's not something that's too far out there to understand.","I believe humanity is a product of alien creation and that's one of the BIG reasons the governments haven't disclosed the truth... Hundreds of hours of research,reading, listening and connecting dots and testimonies to best create a mosiac of truth. But is it a hard pill to swallow. As is all truths"

aliens,"Hi there! Long time lurker, no time poster here. I want to tell you about the possible encounter I had when I was pretty young (5-8 years old). I had been on a camping trip in southern New Jersey. Our campsite had been situated right in front of a small hill, the hill had a thick brush and led to a large lake. It was pretty late at night when it happened. The people who were still awake were sitting by a campfire including me, my aunt, my younger brother, and I think a few other people but I can’t quite remember. It had to be about eleven aclock when a beaming light shined through the trees and the brush. We were pretty creeped out by this. We had looked at it for a short while then me and my aunt went to inspect where it was coming from. Me and her walked a little way down to the area but I had gotten scared and ran back to the campsite. My aunt had followed back.

1: I keep hearing a term ""cryptoterestrials"" I get that it means they were here before man, but what are the details to that? Did they move to somewhere inside the earth? Upper mantle or something? Or as Knapp suggested on the tmz special that their maybe a cellular membrane from us seeing them?

2: I feel like I hear about ""consciousness"" being heavily involved with UFOs. Does this suggest we aren't evolved enough to handle this technology? Or is there something I'm missing?

3: do we believe that our government or the military industrial complex has alien craft? I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth but I feel like I've heard Lue say something very similar to that.

4: is Tom delonge a fool or is he being fed semi truth info?",Questions from a long time believer
aliens,"There are a lot of abduction experience accounts that come with UFO's and small grey aliens, called greys. These beings come to us with greater technological capabilities as well as cognitive ones as an example telepathy.  

I am no scientist or expert or study evolution, but I do have a theory of sorts and it poses a problem. I think we are in crossroads with two paths ahead of us from perspective of evolution; technological evolution and spiritual / cognitive evolution. And I think that both paths are viable to be pursued and eventually they'll become one.  

I and a lot of people have worries about the technological path since technology is neither good or bad, it introduces us to good technology and dangerous technology. And we are not wise enough to see the danger. We talk about dangers of AI, nuclear weapons and climate change and these are the problems we are aware of. How ever there are problems that we aren't aware of like lead used to poison people and it took a long time to figure it out. But what if its more serious problem and we don't understand it before its too late?  

I believe that to not make a critical mistake we need to become greater minds. We are no where near our true potential even from the perspective of our physical bodies. I have a good example that made me consider this whole thing. I sometimes take strong pain killers for my pains. And it makes me able to focus much better than normally. When the numbing effect goes away, I am more itchy than normally. It's because of body hair, even if its just little or very fine its movements causes itching. But prior to taking I wasn't itching nearly as much. Which means that my brain was actively tuning out the sensation. My brain uses capacity to both getting its attention drawn to the itch and tuning out the small stuff. This is the reason sensory deprivation tanks are a thing.  

Perhaps the greys are hairless due to physically evolving that way to enhance their cognitive capabilities. And this extends to things like hunger, thirst, pain, heat and cold, not to mention the other senses. It seems to me that the small body is ideally light as they have no need for a larger physical body. They have no natural threats. And all of this is just to improve the home of the mind. There's so much more to evolving this way rather than going blindly forward with only technology.  

Due to our impatience as species we are now entering the realm of DNA manipulation, well we've been there for a while, but this would allow us to evolve faster. There's so many theories on what consciousness is. We don't know the answer and I think we should find out prior to delving into this artificial evolution.  

And the problem this introduces is that we are fully set on the technological evolution. Do we want to take the other path? Do we as individuals have a choice? Who can we blame if things go critically wrong other than ourselves? Who can we ask for advice?

aliens,"I've explored all manner of wild science based around technology, time travel, alternate dimensions, common religious standards, etc. I enjoy exploring, even if it's only in my mind. My social circle isn't exactly open to any of these wild conversations that might require a little more depth of thought and character than the mundane financial self serving world of money and daily distractions. So I've decided I'm going to leave this here, where likely, just as many people agree with me as think I'm crazy, so here goes:


What if ALL the theories are correct in their existence? And what if it's ALL just really humans, or an incredibly similar biological civilization that advanced ""Pre known humanity""?


The rabbit hole:


If we remove morality and religion to focus purely on the scientific and technological evolution of mankind as an apex symbiotic planetary entity, we can also see that every biological system on our planet has purely worked as a complex symbiotic machine. Each entity has a specific design purpose that the planet has perfected over time. Circle of life, harmony, and eternal balancing etc (Trees provide oxygen, oxygen life, life carbon waste, carbon waste back to trees).


We know that ""Earth like"" planets exist within habitable regions of other stars in the galaxy. So if there can be ""Earth like"" planets, I can safely assume there can also be ""Earth like"" symbiotic processes.


Circle back to mankind being the result of the ultimate evolution of apex hunter gatherer, would it really be a stretch to imagine that apex for a different ELW may also produce a bipedal, two armed, face with two eyes, ears, mouth, nose etc?


'Greys'

Whether it be media, collective knowledge of some sort, or whatever; we've come to see the average 'Grey' as approx 5ft, little to no muscle mass, enlarged craniums, enlarged and blackened eyes, hardly any nostril left or none at all, and smaller to no mouth depending on the theory.


Humans

Humans are currently a bit different in physical appearance, but where are we going?? I picture interbreeding to the point ""race"" is no longer identifiable by skin or specific feature traits. What does our current tech craze look like? As a kid I played outside, physically tough. My kids and all kids like them are glued to phones and tablets. Tech increases to remove physical manual labor, our bodies and nutrition needs will naturally downsize to fit how we use it. Also why craniums will enlarge as we use more brain computing to interact with tech instead of the physical worlds restrictions. This leads to an era of space travel where existence is just as much your space vessel like your body is a vessel for spirit. How do our pupils work? Get big to let in light. Space doesn't have much brightness like a planet, hence the huge black eyes. Everything one ""needs"" will be fabricated via technology at a molecular level, the same way we currently use 3d printers today. No need for a diet or appetite when your biosuit is maintaining your dietary intake on a molecular level. Same with disease, illness, and atmospheric conditions.


Having reached a point of technological singularity, it fabricates an entire universe within itself via computing and ultimate tech endgame (living in a simulation) scenario. In the same way we would build a computer game to play 'in'. However, these ultra evolved beings can interact with tech in unbelievable ways because by that point ALL tech becomes bio tech, allowing them to pass their physical selves into and out of the simulation at will, hence our discovery of possible ""dimensions"" or parallel universes.

I think this would explain that aliens are in fact both essentially by our perspective, time travelers of ourselves (if a society has a million years on us in the same timeline, wouldn't it seem like time travel to us) while also being inter dimensional beings capable of popping in and out the same way we would log out an avatar, only they ARE the avatar. So how in the actual fuck does such a smart society crash into Earth in the fifties? Our simulated ancient tech interferes with the interface. Think of heat and light: neanderthal had fire, but if I try to warm my house with it, it will burn my house down. Now picture a society so far removed from the basics that they had to create a simulated experiment of the past to study, in the same way we study dark matter, protons, nuclear collisions etc….

I don’t remember everything that happened because I’m not sure if anything else happened, I just remember seeing a bridge full of people that looked a lot like the Golden Gate Bridge, and to hear a strange voice saying 'You are only giving us chances to eat you"" I do not remember if that was the phrase, but I remember that in the end it spoke of eating us, maybe the humanity.

I don't believe in alien life but this is fucking weird, this is a message saying that all attempts at communication that we are trying to establish with outside life is a mistake?

Maybe we are just relaying information and our location and that something is heading up for us to ""eat"" us?

aliens,"I'm only writing this post to share my experience, so please don't attack me. 

Amidst the summer of 2007, I communicated with a being that I had never seen before, or again since. I say communicated because it did not speak to me directly, but it showed me images and conveyed emotions to me, some of which I had never felt before.

My experience may not sound spectacular to many of you but I can tell you with full conviction that it was the most terrifying and exciting moment of my life. I was 14 at the time, I remember because the event happened over the summer when I was out of school and my birthday was in the fall afterward. My family lived in a trailer along a highway and behind our home was a forest that my little brother and I explored when we didn’t have anything else to do. We would pack a backpack with some snacks and carry golf-clubs which we would use to “protect” ourselves (from nothing, I should add). Deeper than we generally ventured into the forest was a small pond. I’m bad at measurements but I would say it was 30-ish yards across. My step-dad told us to stay away from the pond because he was almost bit by a snake while fishing in it. 

Like the obedient children we were, we decided to get a little closer to the pond one afternoon. The grass surrounding the pond had grown almost as tall as I was and was very dense. As such, we couldn’t see the pond. We weren’t dumb enough to walk into the grass, but we stayed close to the edge while we played for a while. Suddenly, we heard movement in the grass so we ran in the other direction, I’m ashamed to say I ran ahead of my little brother thinking only about my own safety. As I looked back towards him make sure he was behind me, I saw a large silver disk rise from above the pond and take off faster than I had ever seen anything move in my life. The top of the disk was very reflective, almost mirror-like. I only saw the top for a second or so before it rose out of sight, but I couldn’t see anything that resembled a window. The bottom was much darker and less reflective than the top and had what looked like a series of concentric circles that surrounded what I can only assume was the engine or exhaust. The engine was very brightly light, even in the day time. Just before the disc reached a certain height and sped off, the light from the engine shut off.  

Yearning for an explanation, I told my older brother and sister about what I saw but they were very dismissive. My little brother only caught a glimpse of the disk after it was too high to make out any details. Even after my parents came home from work, they didn’t seem interested in what I saw. My step-dad was only angry that my brother and I were so close to the pond. I had to go about my day as though I made up what I saw, my older siblings even making jokes that I was crazy. 

In the middle of the night, I woke up feeling disturbed. I must’ve dreamt about what I saw because that was the first thing on my mind. The window in my room looked directly into the backyard and I fought with myself for a while on whether I should look out of it. I was terrified at the thought of it, but something I can’t explain motivated me to peek just below the curtain. There, standing just outside the tree-line was the being. I can remember feeling completely frozen in fear, I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. It’s hard to tell how tall it was but I think it had to be just shorter than I was. Its head was very large, and the only features I could make out were its large, black eyes. Its body was, for the lack of a better term, chubby, its arms were long and skinny, its legs were very short and stubby. It was staring right at me, and I could feel it.

Next, image after image flooded by brain. I don’t recall many of them and thinking back the details were mostly irrelevant. The message is what mattered. I think it was trying to tell me that we were hurting the planet. I can remember seeing forests vanish in a time-lapse, clouds of dust after an explosion and black smoke pouring out from some industrial building. I remember feeling grief, as though someone very close to me had just died. My heart felt like it stopped, like it had sunk to the bottom of my stomach. I felt dizzy and confused, almost like I had vertigo. Then, I woke up in bed the next morning. I’ve tried to tell myself that it was a dream, and maybe it was. But it felt too real. It was far too vivid to be a dream. I know that I saw a disk in that forest, and it’s pilot tried to communicate with me later that night. 

Generally, I’m a closed-book, introverted person. I don’t share many details about myself to acquaintances or strangers. And I’ve told very few people about this encounter. But after reading the more recent encounters on this sub, I’ve felt compelled to share my experience. I don’t know exactly what to do, or what I’m supposed to do with the message I was given. However, I know that humanity needs to make a dramatic change in order to save our planet. And the change needs to happen as soon as possible.

aliens,"When i've read your post twice in a row last night i literally started to check your entire comment history aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse me but when you're saying stuff like this :

""Hello hello, Anjeli here, friends. There is a theory that when we are open, we may tap into Akashic energy, which is the record of all. “All what?” you may ask. Just All. All as in Everything. And the Everything is all occurring simultaneously. So, if we take the theory at value, it would explain that you tapped into the Akashic energy and accessed the record. Could have been while you were sleeping the night before, or it could have simply occurred when you were in school. Either way, super happy everyone is safe and your home is still standing.""

It's becoming really hard to believe what you just posted last night. What does "" akashic energy"" even mean ?

Not to mention in another comment you literally said some time ago there we're reptilians in that exact same mountain the greys we're in your story... so where are the reptilians now lol ? did they got moved out because they couldn't afford the rent or what?

You we're also taking DMT wich is a big red flag for me at least because i can't think of somebody that takes drugs and talks about aliens being serious about it.

aliens,"I have gone back and forth with the post made by u/Spacebetweenus and for starters, I enjoy it. At face value it is written well, regardless of spelling errors, my wife is a copy editor, mistakes from the best writers are common. So I am unconcerned.  
While this post is certainly gaining a lot of attention, I think that means something, either it is resonating with you or it is pissing you off because its not giving you the answer that you so desperately want. There is no point in this story where I feel that the writer is trying to be malicious, for all I know, who am I to tell them that this never happened to them even though it certainly seems to have been a meaningful experience to them, I wasn't their and I don't know them but its worth listening so we can get to know them. Smelling bullshit is easier if you have more data.   
So I guess what I am saying is that, regardless if it is a true story or not, who cares! it has a good message. More so it is a good analogy for how us fucking humans can't seem to get a grip and learn to just fucking love each other, really what the fuck is wrong with that message, and even if their is some sort of evil on its way to bop us out of existence, so fucking be it, but this is your life and you get to choose how you live it but I certainly find myself much happier when I am being a decent fucking human and recognizing someone else's existence, I am sure most people here would agree that that is the happiest way to live.   
  Also I keep seeing a bunch of people thinking that the aliens in this story are talking about ""telepathy"" as the communication leap they are talking about, I think we are missing the field  for the trees on that, In my opinion they are talking about plain ol empathy, compassion, love. We are so wrapped up in our own ways thinking that the world is all about ourselves, and no one elses life could possibly be more important than mine, ""GET OUT OF MY WAY I HAVE TO GET HOME TO LOOK AT MY PHONE FOR 4 HRS!"" I am guilty of it, but I am trying to change. If you want to learn inner peace and learn a better way to connect and communicate with other humans on this planet, Meditate. Work those issues out that you have with yourself, like really learn to not only Love but also respect yourself, be happy with your own thoughts. Meditation isn't just sitting cross legged, with a straight back and saying ohm, its different for everyone, for me its about experiencing the moment, feeling what your body feels, quieting the mind, appreciating the people around you and loving that they are alive and have a life too. I remember when I was in Highschool I played in a band and we were jamming for like 3 hours straight and I had never felt that sorta of peace and connection with myself and with my bandmates before, it felt like we had transcended into another plain together, playing in time and knowing without saying, it felt like meditation but extra I guess.   
I'm not a professional but I think maybe we  should take a step back and appreciate the parable or take this story at face value as important data to keep in mind but not get too focused on. If others come out with similar stories or proof it would help solidify this story.

Wow, for someone who spent the better part of the introduction in the story propping up your abilities as a writer, your abilities as a writer leave a lot to be desired. This reads like pretty sharp teenager wrote this, but there are grammatical redundancies and unnecessary descriptions/qualifiers. This post is so poorly written yet so interesting that I don’t know what to make of it. It seems like you’ve done a good job of synthesizing information that a lot of us understand in the abstract (universal consciousness, transcendence, etc.) but you’ve also played into a suspicion of mine; that conventional religions, while anti scientific and primitive, offer us some truths regarding what should constitute a framework for us to live by. I often wonder if the similarities we see among conventional religion are the product of information that our ancestors received by way of some the processes you described here, but lacked the sophistication necessary to make the appropriate connections in order to productively use the information.

A question I have - why does revealing this information jeopardize your position within the government? From what I can tell, all of your experiences seem to have nothing to do with your involvement with the military or government. Your first encounter took place in a hospital, then in your backyard, then your bedroom, then with strangers who just so happen to excavate a tunnel directly to the Aliens front door? Where do your alleged credentials factor into this? Why do you use the fake name Anjali? Are we supposed to buy that a top level government officials name is a Sanskrit translation of ""divine offering"", while ignoring the apocalyptic messaging? 

I’d say that what you’re doing is a great disservice to those of us who want real information to help us answer the Big Questions, and stories like this, while entertaining, dilute the information space.

The Biblical God YHWH (Yahweh) was extraterrestrial. Obviously someone's gonna say: 'yeah.. and what is your alleged evidence?' Well, we know that because ancient people carefully described advanced technology with so incredible details that scientists and engineers were able to reconstruct these devices. I will list a few things:

\- Yahweh travelled through the sky on 'kavod' (translated as 'Glory of the Lord'). This kavod was made of metal and was able to lift up from the ground making big noise (Ez 3,12). In 1974 Josef Blumrich, who was a chief of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA)'s systems layout branch of the program development office at the [Marshall Space Flight Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center), decided to disprove the hypothesis that the Bible describes ancient astronauts. Blumrich analyzed six different translations of the Biblical Book of Ezekiel. Thorough examination convinced him that Ezekiel had, in fact, seen a spaceship. In *the book The Spaceships of Ezekiel* Blumrich asserts that Ezekiel's account in the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) was not a description of a meeting with [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) in a [prophetic vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy), but one of several encounters with ancient [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut) in a [shuttlecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttlecraft) from another planet. Blumrich reconstructed the kavod and obtained official patent for the variant of the Omni wheel. Blumrich is probably the only person to get a technological patent from the ancient writings.

\- Yahweh gave to the Israelites a device which produced 'manna'. In 1978 two engineers, George Sassoon and Rodney Dale, published a book 'The Manna Machine'. In the books of Zohar they found a description of the strange object, Attik Yomin, which produced light, had pipes and produced manna. Engineers reconstruced that device - their work conclude that it was a machine which had created algae as food for human beings in biblical times. Curiously, this condensed form of food from algae is used by an astronauts in spaceships or space and it's very practical. Authors also gave every quote from the books of Zohar. They recreated machine and gave its dimensions and capacity.

\- Yahweh lived in a curious abode in heaven. Apocryphical texts, Apocalypse of Abraham and Book of Enoch, described how both Abraham and Enoch went up to the heaven and then entered a place made of metal and crystals. There were many rooms and doors which opened by itself. There were also many small 'kavods'. The most interesting things is that in the Apocalypse of Abraham, Abraham described how the high place upon which he stands with Yahweh, rotates around, up and down. He saw stars below and earth above and then vice versa. Hermann Oberth, physicist, enginner and father of modern rocketry, described in a book written by Walter-Jorg Langbein, that it is a clue that in fact Abraham (and Enoch) went up to the big alien spaceship which stayed on Earth's orbit. This spaceship rotates around its axis, making artificial gravitation in a habitat for astronauts, so a person who stands there sees the stars above and another time below.

\- Ark of the Covenant - descriptions of this object show that it was a powerful capacitor: everyone who came close to the Ark and didn't wore special clothes... had radiation-like symptoms and then died (Uzzah, Philistines).

\- Urim and Tummim - two objects which allowed the High Priest of Israel to directly communicate with Yahweh, it was sort of a telephone, the voice of Yahweh was heard through Urim and Tummim.

\- Shamir - it was another machine given by Yahweh, this time to king Solomon. Solomon's artisans reputedly used the Shamir in the construction of Solomon's Temple. The material to be worked, whether stone, wood or metal, was affected by being ""shown to the Shamir."" Following this line of logic (anything that can be 'shown' something must have eyes to see), early Rabbinical scholars described the Shamir almost as a living being, a little worm. Shamir was described as a size of a grain. Thanks to the shamir Israelites were able to perfectly cut rock into two pieces without using any other tools. Shamir was identified as a laser by Dr Matest Agrest.

\- Yahweh (and angels) was described in the Bible and Apocryphes as a humanoidal being who wore shining clothes made from metal. He specifically didn't want to show his face, telling Moses that nobody can see his face. Yahweh (and angels) had a 'voice like a thunder' - ancient people couldn't understand microphones.

Summarizing, Yahweh was an ancient astronaut, but people who made a contact with him, considered him a 'God', because they couldn't understand advanced technology and thought that were miracles. We know  that Yahweh was alien because ancient people carefully described his advanced technology with so incredible details that scientists and engineers were able to reconstruct these devices.",Biblical God is alien - scientific evidence

I could post videos but I don’t need people to help me prove it wrong- I need help understanding the different fricking things I’m seeing in the sky. So I’m going to separate the different UAP’s i THINK I’ve seen and I would love if you could comment if you’ve seen it or not. 

1. The blue, lights. Sometimes green. They dance, they love clouds, and sometimes they light up. No bigger than a star. They always fly straight up eventually. 

2. Giant, completely clear aura pulses in the sky. Sometimes with color: red, white, Grey, pink, green, purple, etc. why does it effect the color around it differently than what you’d expect?
Continuing on with these guys, they vary in size and can be anywhere. The huge ones grab my focus but... okay. These freak me out obviously. I’m hoping that a radio show I heard once about how a video game had a lasting side effect on your eyes and this is that. But if other people know these- let me know. 

3. The balls/towers of clumped light. Sometimes seen hovering kinda low. Deep red, white, or orange these things look huge. Far away and huge. 

4. The dancing Marfa lights are now sharing Austin skies. 

5. The white pac man star eating/yellow grabbing pac man grabbing flashing lights out of the sky. Larger than Venus on a good night these sometimes move most of the time stay still. When a camera focuses on them they look like projecting beams of light with a ring around the center. Maybe weird shit on the outside- but with your eyes you just see flashing blue resembling a twinkling star. Sometimes in a line.

Then, it showed that it took mere 80 days to reach Neptune.
Sounds awkward without hyper/warp drive. Could also be whats in trend right now, I mean people talking about astral projection and all to go to places. It's all corrupted now anyways.

It was said in the movie that something is sending strange magnetic or gravitational blast from that region towards earth. So the actor was sent for a search rescue mission for his dad who was trapped doing research on ETs there. While going through his notes he found a poster on which he excitingly confirms to the fact about the existence of intelligent species outside earth. But when asked by the lead actor, his father straight away refuses that he found anything.

So while preparing to go back, his father pulls out and lets himself fall towards Neptune. This is point when the actor asks himself ""WHY GO ON?!"". And in the immediate next clip we see two lights at the opposite ends of an invisible straight thing first reflecting in his helmet and then clearly stopping in front of him in the next scene ( visible only in the original print, rest all the clips in media are edited to hide that as much as possible). What I wonder is why did he just quietly left that place and went back to earth  without any comment or reaction. I mean, it was clear as hell in the movie that something was there. It can't have been a moon,star,asteroid etc.

Plus, I have also seen legit videos on social media where they recorded some strange activity but no physical presence their. And it couldn't have been CGI. That's for sure. Moreover you must have noticed increase in the abnormal sightings in the sky nowadays.

One last part of this strange assumption is bit wild. If you have watch the latest 'Star wars' movie. The planet that palpatine took refuge in, looked almost like Neptune. Pale blue colour,thick atmosphere, lightning visible from space sometimes, and atmosphere with heavy winds and thunderstorms.

If you can match the dots then you have the possible truth right in front of you. Afterall, we all know there's always interesting things hidden in movies and shows.",Please don't judge me but I think I am onto something.

It just got me questioning as to why, I know it's a bit of a stupid question and there's probably an extremely simple answer. My guess is that its from people's description of aliens that they've witnessed, but are there any files online that can back that statement up. I was hoping to look into this for my science class. Totally get it if you ignore this stupid question but I'm just looking for some answers and REALLY hoping for some official documents.",Why do depictions of aliens look the way they do?

aliens,"I know it’s a big unknown, it’s something that’s always intrigued me and I’d be really grateful to get the opinion of others.

My opinion: I think there are almost certainly intelligent civilisations in the Universe. I think the sheer volume of planets, coupled with the same elements that created life here, would render extraterrestrial life almost a certainty. I believe civilisations have also inhabited the universe before and they will do again in the future. 

In regards to the Galaxy i think that we may be alone ( in regards to intelligent aliens), at this point. Given everything that has had to go right, to get to this point on Earth, I’d say the variables would dilute the potential numbers of civilisations to a low level. Perhaps ET has existed in the Galaxy before,  but I’m can’t form an idea either way. 

It’s staggering to think that if Galaxy’s have on average 1 intelligent civilisation alive now, the observable universe would have a minimum of 2 trillion independent civilisations. 

I recon there will be microbial life in the solar system and likely multi-cellular life in a number of planets, but not many, and perhaps intelligent but that’s a big ask.

\* \* \*

It has been theorized by some that humans are the only intelligent lifeforms to exist in the universe. It's understandable how some would think that seeing as how we have yet to discover any intelligent lifeforms but personally I disagree with this theory simply due to how vast and infinite the universe is. We know so little about our universe and so i wouldn't seem too out of the question for intelligent life to exist out there somewhere in the cosmos. Surely we can't be alone in the universe. To me, it just seems unlikely that life could only exist here in the vast and infinite ocean of space. Throughout history science has proven itself wrong time and time again. It was once theorized that the **EARTH** was the center of our solar system until roughly over 420 years ago in the 16th century.",Exploring Alien Civilizations (Starting To Wonder Podcast) Ep 1

Ive also probablly watched Bob Lazar and Commander Fravers Joe Rogain podcast literally a dozen times each.  Richard Dolan was pretty good but his wife has become more predominantly featured in the shows and she brings a lot of psychic/remote viewing sillyness that I personally don't believe and brings UFO credibility down.   Also I have tried Project Camelot and Jesus Christ is that lady annoying.

Maybe a frog wouldnt/dosn't even consider a human if it does see us.

(This story is not mine, I copied and pasted it from a reddit or comment post from 2 years ago that I cannot find and don’t know the title so I made a new title up) 


These experiences began in my families farm in south Texas in the late 80s early 90s.

I was around 8 to 10 years old when this began.

My initial memory of the exact time frame is a bit scewed due to my age at the time, but the majority of the details are as clear as day in my memory 

At this time in my life I knew nothing about aliens or abductions or anything, I have seen science fiction, Star Wars and ET, but I didn’t make any correlation with my experience￼￼ and the fantastical creatures depicted in such films.

At the time it wasn’t something I was really into, I didn’t gain an interest or any knowledge on extraterrestrials or ufology until a few years later until 12 to 13 years old.
Perhaps it was my experience that solidified the yearning to find out more .￼

The farm itself was situated on 200 acres 3/4 of which is open fields with a mix of pasture and lightly forested areas with a small creek that runs through the center of the property,
These areas are divided up into paddocks separated by barb wire and electrical fences, there are 3 houses, sitting on one acre each adjacent to each other in a row East to west on a small hill in the front northern corner of the property￼￼.

I live with my immediate family in the middle house, with my uncle and great grandparents still alive at the time, homes on either side respectively￼, my grandparents home sit on the end of the row going towards the rest of the property.

There are a few barns and various outbuildings situated at the end of the row 
At another acre. All told, the residential portion of the property is about 4 acres on said hill overlooking the rest of the property. This will be relevant as I will describe directions and such.

It was late evening on the tail end of summer, early August as I hadn’t started school yet, it must’ve been after 11:30 or midnight because the adults in my family at the time are older and went to sleep right after the the 10:00 pm news cast central time zone. 

I typically would have a bedtime of 9 pm, naturally I would stay up much later reading books or watching my tv with the brightness and sound turned down, I was not asleep so there was no chance this was dream or some kind of sleep paralysis.

Also another family member witnessed me awake in the house directly after this event. Either way, after I was sure the adults had gone to bed, I went to the kitchen to get a drink of water, as I was standing at the kitchen sink, I looked out the window and noticed a bright orange glow at the bottom of the hill.

We had a bar fire the previous year, so I thought it was another fire, but there was no smoke cloud or smell of smoke, curious, so I walked out of the kitchen into the adjacent hallway in to the back door￼, I went outside to see what was going on before I ran around waking anybody up. Immediately I remember my dogs didn’t come running out from under the porch to greet me, they didn’t even come out and follow as I’m walking through the yard.

As I’m making my way through the back yard, it was eerily quiet, no cicadas no crickets or any nigh sounds as you would expect, I don’t think I realized it at the time, but in hindsight it definitely stands out in my mind. I walked towards the back edge of our acre towards the light￼￼￼￼.  I was almost compelled to keep walking towards this anomaly. 

I hop over the fence to my great grandparents yard into the back fence at the edge of the top of the hill, I hoisted myself up the top of the fence. And what I saw I will never forget. The creek runs through at the bottom of the hill, on the other side sat a small egg shaped craft standing upright, the front of the craft had a large oval shaped hatch that was open, The orange glow was emanating from inside the craft, but the light spilled out and enveloped the craft ￼in surrounding area. 

I remember the light was pulsating out in a kind of corona, like looking at a street light when you have water in your eyes.

The craft itself was a silver metallic color but it was mat, not shiny and it didn’t actually reflect any of the light like you would expect. It was maybe about 10 to 12 feet tall and perhaps it was just as wide around at the bottom, tapering to an area maybe 3 feet in circumference at the rounded top of the egg.

It was held upright about 6 inches off the ground by what I assume was a tri pod of metal legs, which for the life of me I remember coming straight out of the lower sides of the craft but not out of obvious ports like an aircraft, and they were maybe only a foot in length.

There was no other lights I could recall on the outside, the only source of light was coming through the hatch, in hindsight, the craft itself reminds me of a drop pod or something like you see in sci fi movies, definitely didn’t strike me as something you would use for regular travel, as I’m sitting there watching, a small being about 3 1/2 ft tall is outlined as a black lit shadow in the door way, it exits the craft and begins what looks to me like taking samples of soil or plant life, then turning around and going back inside, it did this a couple of times as I’m watching from the top of the hill, it did not seem to notice me, now here is where it gets somewhat weird in my mind.

The creature at first looked like some kind of, and I’m serious now, it looked like an Ewok,￼￼￼￼ but without clothing, it was small and furry from the distance I was observing it.

I was on the fence watching that creature do it’s work for about 2 minutes more or less.

At some point I decided to jump down and start walking down the hill to get closer, I remember being more excited than scared￼￼ because, I’m my young mind this was like something from tv come to life and I was the only one to be witnessing it. 

So I make my way downhill and suddenly I’m aware of something off to the right back over my shoulder, it’s the whoosh sound of something running up behind me from the other side of the fence.

I turned look back, and as I did The sound of a crash of tin metal rings out into the night, I realized quickly that something had just run through a gap in the fence by the gate that my uncle had plucked up with a sheet of tin metal, I see a blur run past me and I turn to follow it as it runs incredibly fast past me down the hill towards the craft.

The other being looks up the hill in my direction and then turns to scurry into the craft as the other one gets too him. 

I begin running down the hill trying to catch up to them. Here my memory kind of jumps and I am standing at the other side of the creek in front of the craft.

Staring at the open hatch, one of the creatures steps out, at this point he looks like the furry Ewok creature but then this fuzzy shell dissipates and standing in front of me is what can be best described as A short gray, 
One thing I should point out is it did not look precisely the way presented in pop culture and media, they had was large but not a rigid angular teardrop shape, rather it was like a human head but a little more bulbous. 

It reminded me a bit like the watchers from the Marvel comics, but really like an oversized embryo head, The eyes were large and human like, but not pointed edges like popular Depictions, they were reminiscent of eyes like a sugar glider, nocturnal eyes and not completely black.

They just had a very large pupils that were dilated to let as much light in as possible 
This is as best as I can describe them, 
and to me it makes logical sense because they operate mostly in the dark. 

They have small slits for nostrils and a bump in the nose, small mouth but no teeth that I could discern, it could open its mouth but not to speak any words, it’s body was small with a slight build much like you see in media depictions.

The only thing I could say is they look very light and fragile, and the movements are very fluid and methodical, long arms long fingers,
very thin legs and small feet that are split in the center like ninja shoes.

They wore a full tight body suit that was formfitting and made of dark, very dark Gray or very dark navy material that had kind of a faint metallic sparkle in it but it didn’t absorb or reflect light.

They had five skinny fingers, the one outside the craft had gloves on, but the other one did not, they may have taken it off as the one outside did later on,
they both had on standard military style boots, no laces but again were split in the middle like ninja shoes.

As it’s furry form dissipated, It seemed intrigued by its reaction that I could see it in its true form, I know now that it was most likely observing my subconscious thoughts, And try to disguise itself as this Ewok to either mislead me into thinking that I imagined it, or lured me into a false sense of security so I wouldn’t be afraid,
Either way I was not afraid, And I actually waved at it and said hello

When I spoke, the other entity leaned back out of the hatch and looked at me, and the one in the ground smiled and looked back at its partner,
they begin making what sounded to me like light chirping or clicking sounds.
they seem to be having a brief conversation about the fact that I could see their true forms,
That I wasn’t freaking out and what to do with me.

The one inside the craft didn’t seem too keen on me being there, he seemed a little freaked out that I had shown up, and judging by the way he bolted down the hill, I can’t say I blame him.

Either way the one on the ground must’ve convinced him to let me hang around a bit,
because he basically just kind of went

“All right whatever you say but you deal with it and don’t tell me I didn’t tell you so if he starts freaking out”

Kind of comical and humanizing when you think about it, so he comes towards me and tells me

Hello

This was done telepathically as I realized later,
but a time I didn’t really notice it was telepathy as I spoke to him with my actual physical voice, but his voice was in my mind,
but seemed no different than as if you and I were talking at the dinner table,
Kind of hard to explain that but I hope it makes sense, I asked him what they were doing out here, They told me they were taking samples.

I asked him where they were from

And he told me they had come from far away, but that they were closer than we think.

He said they visit often to keep an eye on things, he told me they were on a research mission.

I asked him if I could help, he hesitated a bit but he said sure, he went back to the craft for a moment and came back with a cylinder and a small metal tube, he made a motion for me to come closer and I did, he takes the small metal tube and presses the bottom sides.

The end of the tube opened like a birds beak, he scooped up a bit of soil from the ground and the tube snapped shut, he then took the cylinder and I noticed there are some are some holes at the top, he slides the tube into one of the holes and it clicked into place,
he produces another metal tube and opens the end and hands it to me.

I do the same as he did and I try to close it,
but can’t find the mechanism on the sides to make it close, he seems amused by this and I handed it to him, he tells me it only works for them, and he snaps it shut and places it into the cylinder, we do this a few more times, me scooping the dirt and him closing the tubes and placing them into the holes until we fill the cylinder.

as he is placing things back into craft,I begin looking around for other things I think he would be interested in. I hand him a few stones that had flint in them and tell him they’re my favorite kind, 

I pull up a couple of plants and tell him a bit more about them from what I knew￼, he seemed above it all￼, but being that I was a child he humored me anyways

I let him know that I’m good at catching frogs and crawfish from the creek, and ask him if he would like one, he said that they don’t take biological specimens and, that wasn’t their department,
they were looking for elements. 

I should mention at this point that where they had landed was on top of an area where, the previous year, my uncle had buried some of the scrap and debris from The barn fire, there were also some old refrigerators and other metal things buried there over the years,
It was a bit of a mini landfill, the dirt in the area was still somewhat barren and freshly dug.

I believe this is what might’ve brought them to the specific spot, a high concentration of metal under the ground, this entire bit of time while we were taking samples was probably around 30 to 45 minutes.

After we finished I asked if we could see inside, he said I could have a look but there wasn’t much to see, he told me that there was a much bigger ship waiting for them and he pointed up to the sky.

He turned and stepped up into the craft, I started to take a step up but the other one stopped me, The first one told me to just look but don’t come all the way in and don’t touch anything.

I lean in from the doorway and crane my neck around to see as much as I could,
inside the craft seemed larger than what it appeared on the outside but not by much,
of course, this is all relative to our size and I was a child at the time,
The walls were stark white and concave matching the egg shaped exterior. 

I looked up to the ceiling and noticed ￼where the light was coming from, the round center of the ceiling was just brightly glowing with a golden orange light.

It was blinding if I looked too long, but the interior was much more dim than the bright glow outside would lead you to believe, there was a kind of low shallow shelf for on the central edge on the walls, there were recesses ￼
In the shelf which contained the sample canisters.

There were also some cube containers which I assume contain larger samples of things, but we never used them so I’m not sure.

To one side the shelf bulged out and there was a kind of control panel with two seats, like small bucket seats next to each other each perched on a single pedestal.

There were no buttons or switches or anything on the panel.  But what was most intriguing is that there were flat touchscreen panels, much like the tablets we use today.

There were symbols and things on the panel screen but for the life of me I couldn’t reproduce them if I tried.

Directly above this control panel was a bit of a recessed area flattered to the wall but a little darker than the rest of the wall, this was a type of port or window to see out of the craft.

This window was a strip about a foot high and 3 feet across. The first entity places its finger to a touchscreen, and the window popped open and I could see out, it didn’t Appear to be visible from the exterior of the craft, I kind of exclaimed “wow”, And then it popped closed again.

At this point the first one tells me that it is time for them to be going, and they have already taken too long and will most likely will be reprimanded for letting me help￼ them, I asked them if I could come along with them, he tells me that he cannot do that at this time, they’re not allowed to bring back biological specimens, repeating what he said before. 
Besides, I would not be able to survive for long and, they had no nourishment for me.

I remember asking him what nourishment means and he told me they had nothing for me to eat. I told them I can no back home and make a snack, he said I would need more food than that, I told him I like pizza and we could go get some. 

He seemed to find my insistence humorous, but his partner seemed to be getting annoyed, and he told me that it wasn’t possible and that he would take me home.

The next thing that I remember is that we are both back in the hallway of my house, standing just inside the back door. The entity tells me thank you for my assistance and that I  was a good helper. 

I asked him if he would be back for me, he said that right now I was too young, maybe in a few years they would be back, being stubborn, I told them I really wanted to go, he said to just wait and then told me to hurry along, he really needed to leave because they can’t stay here for too long in our environment.

he actually said atmosphere but when I asked him what that was, he said something about the air and climate but I didn’t comprehend at the time, he just seemed to get very anxious about being in my house, then he backed up and just phased out of the house directly through the back door.

I turn around to go back out the hall to my room, just then one of my uncles who was staying at us at the time and opens the door to his room, adjacent to mine, and asks me what I was doing up, I told him I was getting a drink of water and I begin to tell him about helping this little man I met in the backyard.

He groggily tells me that I left the light on in the kitchen on in the kitchen, and to go back to bed, it’s 3:30 in the morning, then he slams his door shut and goes back to bed. 

I go to the kitchen to turn off the light, but the light isn’t on, the glow from the craft is still shining in from outside. I watch out the window for a bit and after a few moment the light fades out and I see a greenish white bolt of light shoot up into the sky from below the hill.

It’s dark again, and I turn around and head back to my room, I didn’t sleep the rest of the night and waited till the sun came up.

In The days following try telling my family what I saw, but no one seemed to believe me of course, my uncle told me that he had seen me awake that night and thinks I went outside again. 

Back then I would sometimes sneak outside and play with the dogs or stargaze and stuff. My parents just told me to stay inside, something about the boogie man, blah blah blah, the usual parental stuff about not going outside late at night. 

The only one that even believed me was my late grandmother, she told me that she had seen them before, but she told me they were angels, she was a very religious person and toward the end of her life she would talk about seeing angels and would always have a collection of angel knickknacks, as I got older and had a few more encounters with these beings, I would discuss them with her, but she would always refer to them as angels. 

I also spent a lot of time ￼ ￼back to the landing site looking for any clues. 

It retained this kind of charged air around the area for quite some time after the event. The cows typically avoided this area as well, my uncle set up a feeding pen near it for a while but he had to move it since the cows wouldn’t touch it and the hay kept rotting. 

Incidentally he got a mule a few years back and any time he’s in that particular paddock he’ll stand some ways off from that patch of ground and Bray in that direction￼. If you tried to lead him over to it or near it, he’ll resists and kick back, so I didn’t bother attempting that again. 

This particular uncle hasn’t heard my story my cousin has also found a few cattle and goats mutilated in the property over the years, but never in this paddock, very strange indeed.

I’ve had a handful of encounters of what I wholeheartedly believe are extraterrestrial beings, 

I would learn more about them not only from books and media, but directly from the entities themselves.  As I said  if anyone has taken the time to read this whole post and is interested in hearing more about my experience, i’m happy to share.

i’m now on my mid-30s and no longer live on the farm but do visit often. Whenever I think about, it I go to that spot by the creek and look for signs that they have returned and try to see if they have left anything behind, So far I just have the memories of my experiences

Physical evidence of UFOs and alien abduction seems to support many stories told by people, though some reports may actually be caused by dreams, mental problems, media indoctrination, or misinterpretation of what the person has seen. Interestingly, it doesn’t seem like a cultural thing – most countries have reports of alien abductions. They occur in large cities as well as the rural areas at any time – day or night. A lot of abductions do not get to be reported because there is no one trusted to tell, or the abductee is afraid of being made fun at, especially if they feel they have been sexually assaulted. Those who have been abducted several times keep journals to determine patterns or timetables.

Abductees have tried many interesting techniques to protect themselves, but to date, I know of no one specific approach that prevents these experiences. Abductees have reported attempts to video or photograph the events. Some abductees have experimented with infrared film. Most footage is useless. My opinion of this experience: We are all part of a biogenetic experiment - the abduction phenomena is a metaphor for the greater experience. The Greys are part of the programmed illusion as all is a virtual experience in time and emotion. Often abductees are told that the experience is for some 'greater good'. Always remember that anyone who does anything to you without your permission - or makes your soul feel uncomfortable - does not have your best interests at heart. Be careful what you believe.

The abduction phenomenon is an umbrella term used to describe a number of hypotheses, claims or assertions stating that non-human creatures kidnap individuals, sometimes called abductees, usually for medical testing or for sexual reproduction procedures. Many such encounters are described as terrifying or humiliating, but others describe them as transformative or even pleasant. Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made from around the world but have perhaps seen most mainstream attention in the United States.

aliens,"Was asked to retell my experience in another subreddiso here we are. This night happened about 5 years ago, and when reflecting on it makes me fucken sick. So we're waaay up river about 45km,  on the Saskatchewan River up in northwest Manitoba. We usually the the truck out on a hunt but this time we took a 24 foot motorboat to change the pace, we also all enjoy a good cruise on the river. So its me, my dad, my unclewho we'll call D, and a close family friend who's basically an uncle, we'll call him Johnbo, cause that's Johnbo.
     We set up camp on the shore of the river earlier in the day and had been on the water for most of the evening. It was a cool autumn night, open sky, plenty of stars, the milky way was directly above us. Not much was happening in the means of hunting at this point, we were drinking beers, having a blast, getting away from the daily grind. We take a turn into this little creek system we know takes us to a small lake deeper in the woods. By this time it's about 11:30pm and we're just about coming into the opening to the lake when my dad makes the comment ""you notice how still and silent it got out of nowhere?"". Up until then we were all having a blast. After that was said we all shut the fuck up and took in the most ominous atmosphere. The stillness was palpable, we all knew something was afoot. So we sit at the break in the tree at the mouth of lake when the air take on this strange thickness, like the air is charged with electricity. Were all scanning the trees and the sky when Johnbo says quietly      "" look at that fucken glow in the trees"". At our 4 o'clock in reference to the boat we see this electric blue glow coming over the trees. 
     Then we see it, there, right above the trees was a metallic ""glowing"" triangle shaped craft about 50 feet on each side with a blue pulsating blue light under what I can say was the front of it. It came over the water. We were all frozen, no one said a word. As it came over the lake, poof, it was gone. We all sat there mortified, then my uncle D starts the boat and we start making our way to the main river. The atmosphere felt normal, the woods were making their regular sounds. The birds were tripping. I thought this was weird, no one still hadn't said a word. As we came to the river the sun was on the horizon. We all tried to make sense of how this was possible, going back and forth saying we just got to that lake at about 12:30am. Now it's 6:45am. We make it back to camp, get all our shit on the bkat without saying a word, and fucken gunned it back to town. On the way back no one said anything. We just sat there in silence drinking what we had left thinking what the fuck happened.",Was abducted while hunting in northern Manitoba.

Captured late on Saturday Night, the witness records 2 segments, which we zoom in on, slow down to 1/4 speed, and bring up the brightness a bit to tease out any darkened details.

The UFO, (or UFOs?) was filmed over a heavily forested mountain range beyond the outskirts of the City of Hong Kong.

What caught our attention to feature this video footage is the unusual behavior of the light patterns. It is almost as if the object is shooting out smaller objects to its left, OR, it has a static light on the right, with intermittent flashing lights going anti-clockwise around its 'perimeter'..??

So i meditated by a tree aftwr i setup camp. I got out my littlw windburner stove made plain spagehtti noodles and broccoli and boiled a few eggs.

aliens,"Ok, nobody entitled to believe this, but ima post it anyway.  

Im not super into aliens or shit like that, but I don't go alone to take hottubs at night. So 2 years ago when I was 19. I was living with my parents at the time, because had dropped out of school and was living there for a little. I was working as a parts fabricator for a shitty welding place. I had to wake up at 5:00 AM, and be on the road by 6.  In February one morning I had to piss at 3:25AM, so ya boy went and did the deed. I figured I was going to be up in an hour and a half or so anyway. So I went outside to take a hottub. Now lets be real. its pitch black at 3:30 AM in the northpart of California. you cant see shit.  you cant hear shit, its looking scruff.  so Im chillen with my Nuts out. its bitch black. so about 2 minutes go by and im staring up at the sky. I get this weird feeling in my nuts. and I look straight across my yard at the fence , which is about 56ft away. I see through the boards this light. it looks like a street lamp type shit. my brain isnt working at 3:35 am. my brain thinks, ""damn, the sun is rising kinda quick. "" and i see it rise up slowly thru the fence boards. now my brain has switched gears, and I'm starting to think. ""damn, either the neighbors are boolin on me, or the sun is fast and small and in my neighbors yard at 3am."" now the light has crested the 13 foot fence. this thing looks like a clear basketball that someone put a really orange lightbulb into. My brain now is in full panic mode, and i bolt from the hottub twards the orb in order to get into my house. I don't close the hottub or get my shit. i just run, Im a 19year old man, and Im straight spooked. I run to the door and slam it shut behind me. I turn around and just see it go across the yard past the hottub over the fence. I turn on all the lights, and run to my room . That same day after work, I bought a small pellet rifle. I got home and knocked on my neighbors door, I asked them about the light. they say they have no idea. I think could tell how spooked I was. and they assured me there wasn't anything.   Bruh, Ima be real, shit got me fucked up. what the fuck. flying orange basketball or sum shit. idk but I haven't taken a hottub in the dark in like 2 years.",goddamn basketball looking alien headass

aliens,"This is a science fiction trope annoys me to no end. I mean really? they themselves must've had an evolutionary beginning somewhere, and it wasn't clean. It's not like they popped into existence with the technology ready in hand. They probably had their ups and downs. Hell maybe our current political hellscape is relatable. I just don't see why they would want to axe us off over something they probably went through.

It sounds hypocritical, judgey and plain childish. I'm willing to wager it's an anthropological self projection from the writer. It's terrible practice to place the same expectations you have for people onto truly otherworldly beings. Gotta get out of the box 

Another cheesy trope I keep finding is ' in order for them to truly be superior they should have no emotions'. There is no such thing as operating on pure logic. Logic is a system of finding solutions, think of it as a calculator for an example. It has the capacity to solve complex problems but it doesn't *wants* to do anything.

Without a person wanting to solve a problem--It just sits there. Emotions are the part which gives a person interests, agenda and goals to work towards. As long as you move, you're following a feeling. 

For example;
Executing horrific experiments for science (something they're usually depicted doing)

It requires curiosity a feeling. but some writers insist they got none of it.

What's realistic to write is they might have improved emotional control. It sounds reasonable to expect. Those things can get out of hand.

She and I were sitting in some type of enclosure of furniture...and we were like just together. HOWEVER, it wasnt like a mother son thing at all...there was a sexual aspect to this dream looking back on it.
Plus I didnt know her in the dream...

I remember her being very nice but like I said...
She was kissing me and there was some type of weird sexual thing. I was a kid though...I do not see how she could have possibly liked me then...at all.

Thats like wtf.

The dream had a weird zoom out aspect...hard to explain.

Anyways, i had many similar dreams later on.

Recently I have come to find that maybe the chick has been stalking me since then...for no apparent reason.
I do not know why.
At all.

Someone said this may have been a screensaver done by the ""aliens""...meaning this young vivid dream wasnt dream and was something bad?

aliens,"On the 25th of September in Adelaide, south Australia, I was lying on my lawn and stargazing. It was a pretty normal night with few stars and a few clouds and suddenly I see about 8 to 15 orange lights brighter than all the other stars zoom across the sky in a triangle formation. I was shocked and thought it was either some sort of meteor shower, space x satellites or even aliens. I saw that they were above the clouds as they went behind a few and after about 5 seconds they were out of view. 
I tried to get my phone out, but by the time I got my camera up, they were gone. I then went straight to google and found the case of the Phoenix lights phenomenon and the images almost exactly resembled what I saw. There was also no noise to go with these lights.

aliens,"When I was about 13 or 14 years old, my friends Juan, Adrian and I used to go squid fishing in the summer at the port of my town (it is a fishing town in northern Galicia with no more than 2000 inhabitants).
That night we had gone to the beach, we had no choice (and I am still cursing that decision), there were many people fishing in the port and we did not want to bundle our lines with those of other fishermen, since we were with some friends from Madrid (David and Marco) who came on vacation and didn't know how to fish.

There was a full moon, it was not so dark to be 11 or 12 at night, I remember the reflection in the sea.
We sat in our folding chairs and started fishing, we spent a while telling stories and laughing, having a good time.
After a while we concentrated on what we were doing since we had not caught anything and we entered into a deep silence, only the sea and the reeds gathering their line could be heard.
Marco pointed with his finger towards the top of the cliff that is next to the beach (about 200 meters from where we were) and said: that rock gives the impression that it is going to fall.


My friend Adrián immediately said: I don't think I've ever seen her before


Juan also said that he believed that there was not a stone so big (it would be about 5 or 10 meters) that I said I was not sure.


We were all attentive, while Adrian said that this was not a stone that shone differently from other rocks and that it had a very soft shape. (It was shaped like a flattened egg or like a raindrop but more rounded)
We were watching all night but nothing happened. The truth is that the stone had a shape that if an adult saw it, he would surely panic and go home, the next day they would not believe him, period. Today I still remember that shape and where it was located on that cliff and I'm scared to death. As children, we are still there watching her.

We each went home wondering what that stone was, and why it had that shape and why it shone like that.
Shortly after I got home, I received a message from Adrian on the mobile phone telling me that from his house you can see the cliff and that he is looking with the binoculars and that he does not see the stone, that he go down to look.

I live next to the beach, there wasn't even 15 minutes before I got home, my parents had woken up and I couldn't get off, I had to wait.

When they fell asleep, I left my room like a ninja and left the house without making the slightest noise. It was more or less 2 in the morning.
Upon reaching the beach and looking at the cliff, the stone was missing. A strong heartbeat makes me shiver with fear and I go straight home.
Upon arrival I write to Adrian to tell him that I just went to the beach and he tells me that he also told Juan so that he could check it out.

The next day, my mother woke me up with the news that Juan had disappeared all night but that he was found at dawn in the center of town crying, very sweaty and staring.

The whole town was puzzled. Juan's mother had spent the worst night of his life while Juan did not remember anything of what had happened, he only remembers walking around town until someone saw him and called his parents and the authorities.
Our mothers during that time were very scared thinking that there was some type of rapist or psychopath who kidnapped children and prohibited us from playing in places where there were no more people, much less going fishing.
Juan was given medical tests of all kinds, physical and psychological, and apparently Juan shows a serious trauma to something that he does not know how to explain, he does not remember what happened, he only remembers a feeling that is what scares him. This was told by Juan's mother to my mother, she did not give her many more details either.
We did not see Juan again until he started the school year, and he was never the same as before. He was very inactive, submissive, he was always alone and did not want to talk to anyone.
He had always been a very sociable boy, like everyone else. He was our friend and after the incident he stopped talking to everyone and kept away from people.
Today 12 years have passed and we do not know anything about Juan, shortly after the incident he and his parents moved to another place because it was said that Juan had outbreaks of anxiety here.

Adrian and I never talked to anyone about it because nothing made sense at the time.

The police the day after the event (when Juan appeared) checked the messages on his cell phone and saw that Adrian had sent him an envelope at 2 in the morning telling him to go to the beach to check the stone, which he thought was no longer I was.
The police gathered the boys together and asked us nonsensical questions like if we played a joke on Juan or if we had gotten involved with other older boys to tie him to a tree.
But our mad The res corroborated that we were at home and that obviously we were not going to do anything like that to a friend of ours who had been like brothers at that time.

Adrian and I, years after the event, came to the conclusion that it was a UFO (we have seen photos of UFOs taken by other people in other places practically identical to the one we saw) and that that night Juan was abducted. Today nobody knows anything about Juan and his family.

From that moment on I have followed the UFO phenomenon and the subject of abductions and everything I have seen (except 4 or 6 UFO videos) is all false. Those people talking with that face of having slept well, with that exactitude when recounting the facts, that way of expressing themselves as if what had happened to them was normal ... they don't tell the truth.

I think I can confirm 100% that I have seen a friend before and after being abducted and that changes your life for the worse, you go crazy because of what you see (you do not consciously remember what happened, but your subconscious yes, always, and that's where the traumas come from) the expression on your face changes, you become more submissive and insecure ... it's a bunch of negative things, you are no longer the same person.

aliens,"Hi all,

A common problem with the UFO/UAP phenomenon is that people do not have a camera ready when they spot something unusual/unknown in the sky and those that do have a camera ready often take poor quality videos, which may be due to cheap cameras, poor lighting, unstable/moving video, etc.

I and my colleague are both academics working as research scientists (computer science, statistics, and machine learning). Both of us are employed by universities ranked in the top 5, globally.  We are currently working on a project which involves building out a network of sky-facing cameras for various purposes. 

Being interested in the UFO topic, my colleague and I decided to see if this community would be interested in such a project for the purposes of monitoring the skies.
The idea here is that you would fix a camera kit to the roof of your house, or out of your window, and either live stream the video to our platform or upload it later. A mobile version will allow you to stream live from your smartphone/tablet. 

In return, we will provide access to all of our live camera feeds from around the world, alerts, the ability to search live and historical video based on various tags/categories/topics, and a community of like-minded UFO enthusiasts. 

In order to help us better understand the desire for such a service, we would really appreciate it if you would complete the following short questionnaire:

aliens,,Unexplained events
aliens,[removed],I think I was Abducted last week
aliens,"First things first, I have an unshakable belief, beyond wishful or religious in the existence of Alien life in the form of intelligent beings. This belief was refined over the years with the study of the phenomenon, the books, my inclination to ancient history that brought me to the not so refined works of Von Daniken but which in turn led me to Zacharia Sitchin and many others. This is not a recent phenomenon, my phobia, nightmare fuel and simultaneous fascination with Aliens/UFO has been there since my very first memories. I have a constant feeling that I do not remember something, and if I do recall it I am not completely certain that these are fabricated memories, from dreams or my young imagination, following are some of the earliest memories I have, between ages 6 and 12-13 in Italy.

My very first recurring nightmare was of having a picnic with my parents in a green grass park, next to trees when suddenly 4 to 5 tall men in grey suits (at the time I associated them to the enemies of the Power Rangers ""Putty Patrollers"" please check for images on google) would grab me and take me away.
Another recurring dream, especially when I had a fever, was of running/driving/flying uncontrollably fast. In specific one of being on someone's shoulders while he ran reaching absurd speeds.
I can not be one 100% sure but I have crosschecked this next point with my mother who seems to remember something of the sort. I remember waking up with 9 round brownish burned looking marks on the stomach. This memory came flooding back after watching a documentary on the Falcon Lake incident and seeing similar marks on one of the abductees.
In my childhood I have been sick on a regular basis, almost monthly with very high and sudden fevers.
Lastly in this age range I have vague memories of symbols scratched onto my window, but I still dismiss them today as just dirt, an obsession with spotting satellites and a lasting fear of the dark. To this day I find it difficult to fall asleep unless some movie, or show is playing on my laptop.
The following is from ages 13-14 to 19-20. (I am 31 years old)

In France, where I have lived for about 10 years we have a large enough property with a modern Chalet style house in the middle of a large garden surrounded by trees. At night from the very beginning I could hear heavy steps running around the house from my ground floor bedroom. The steps would get fainter as they went around and louder as they approached closer to my room. The time the steps took to run around the house in circles was too fast, weirdly fast. Something worth mentioning is the stomping was clearly of two distinct footsteps and not of an animal running on all fours. This happened every night throughout the 8-10 years I have lived there with my mom.
During this time, I can not recall if it was while the running sound was happening, our garden developed a ""Fairy Ring"" quite large in diameter between 3-4m. I have read about them and even if the name implies something Fairy Related, the explanation is of a fungus colony that takes the ring like shape. Nonetheless given all of the above, I thought it worth of mention.
During one of the summers spent in Italy when i was small, I have witnessed something I still can not explain, and I was not alone. While with a friend, at his grandparent's house playing in the back yard, we could see the lit lights of the 3 stories house in front of his. In particular one window was lit in yellow light with the horizontal shades open and the outline of a man with both his hands up on the glass and his fingers moving as if playing with the shades. I turned to look at my friend who in turn looked at me freaked out, we both turned our heads towards the window and the same shadowy outline with its hands up on the window and its fingers playing with the shades no longer had its head. It was headless and still moving. We ran away immediately terrified. I have spoken to him about it 2 months ago.
In the same bedroom mentioned earlier one night while fully awake and conscious something quite silly but terrifying took place. I was trying my best to fall asleep as I had school the next morning and one voice as loud as hear my fingers typing now, said in my ear ""YOU'RE A PENGUIN"". I do not claim a connection with anything and I do not know if the voice in my head or rather in my ear said something that sounded like that or if in fact perhaps, I am a penguin. I did not sleep that night and I now wonder what my brain interpreted that voice to be saying. Something worth mentioning is after telling the story to my father he said that shortly before he woke up from a voice shouting in his year ""67"". Again, do not know that it means, if it means anything or if you heard of similar accounts.
I have what I believe to be a small cyst in my arm, I can feel it and hold it between my fingers, it feels mobile. I do not doubt that it is exactly that, a cyst that I should probably get it removed, but in the spirit of full disclosure I have thought, on multiple occasions, what if it isn't.
Today.

Today I am 31, I have an incredible girlfriend who believes me and a family who doesn't disbelieve me, I am passionate and studious in the phenomenon, I have the books, and they taught me about history, the manuscripts of Jung who in its part taught me about philosophy and psychoanalysis, I have the military documents from more trustworthy sources (Greer and others) and less so (Tom Delonge....). In any case, the strangeness quieted down since I moved to the Middle East in 2015 but it hasn't stopped and my interest is boiling inside me more than ever. Just writing all of it down for the first time clarifies and sharpens memories, and I am sure I missed a few. I am studying the region for historical features which could be connected to the phenomenon, and I have found rock carvings in Oman clearly depicting greys within humans.
Just recently my mother found a very strange foot of what we guess could be an animal in the same garden in the house in France. The skin is white and bloodless, the texture is chicken like but the size is too big and wide to be an avian.
Last week the light in my apartment in Dubai turned on in the middle of the night, while with my girlfriend.
While driving a low light orb was on top of my car and as I was looking at it, it suddenly shot forward disappearing at the horizon.
My move to the Middle East has brought a lot of positive energy, as if lifted from something I have started to go to the Gym very regularly, my mind feels sharp, I am eating well and am driven on my career. I have a fantastic relationship with my girlfriend and I feel good enough to share the above weirdness.

aliens,"Just wanted to get everyone's perspective on Lazar and his story. First of all I'll mention that I am bias, I find the topic of space and alternate lifeforms incredibly fascinating and I really do believe that there are other forms of life out there. After watching various interviews from Bob and his rogan interview as well as the jeremy corbell documentary, I find him very sincere and uncomfortable talking about his experiences and I think this adds to his credibility. I think ultimately it has had a more negative effect on his life, something which I don't think is mentioned enough. He even eludes to this on the rogan podcast, stating that this is a terrible idea and it will make things ""worse"". I also think the recent ufo disclosures further bolster his credibility in terms of how he mentioned they move around and also the governments admittance of ufo programmes existing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also curious about the statement I heard recently, echoed by rogan, that the government have ""off world vehicles"", did this come directly from the government or from an indirect source? Anyway what do people think of this and the recent disclosures?

aliens,"**The W56, the aliens who ate fruit: the incredible ""Case of friendship"" has re-emerged**

&amp;nbsp;

Gaspare De Lama is a Swiss family in the group that met extraterrestrials in Pescara in the 1960s

&amp;nbsp;

Lecco - The incredible facts - which began in '56 and lasted over 20 years - of aliens who became friends of a group of earthlings, including a Swiss family, are in our time the subject of renewed attention. The ""Friendship Case"" is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and important in the history of modern ufology: a dozen people lived a long friendly relationship with a community of extraterrestrials mainly in Pescara where they were based. The meetings lasted from 1956 to 1978. Humans nicknamed the alien community ""W56"", an acronym for ""long live '56"". The real name of these aliens - human in appearance, of various heights and from different galaxies - is Akrij, in Sanskrit ""the Sages"". This story or legend, depending on your point of view, remained unknown to the mass until 2007, when the book “Contattismi di Massa” by Stefano Breccia, one of the group, was published. Since then there has been growing attention not only among scholars but also among the general public. There are no more interviews and conferences (which sometimes last until 2 in the morning so much is the interest of the people) to which one of the living witnesses, 97-year-old Gaspare De Lama, is called in many regions of Italy. The facts he narrated are reviving that debate that was once held in secret only between experts. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Mr. De Lama, why is there never indisputable evidence of the existence of aliens?**

&amp;nbsp;

«Ufology is not a science, even if it concerns it closely, nor a faith, therefore it is foolish to expect impossible reproductions in the laboratory with our poor terrestrial means, just as it is foolish to believe without criteria. Perhaps the correct attitude is given only by the awareness that inconceivable things happen with respect to the parameters of our current knowledge. We can only see 5 percent of the material, let alone if we understand the remaining 95 percent ».

&amp;nbsp;

**Why the Friendship Case resurfaces strongly after so many years, what's underneath?**

&amp;nbsp;

""There is the simple fact that the times are a little more mature.""

&amp;nbsp;

**If they are more mature, why don't these ""friends"" finally manifest themselves to all of us?**

&amp;nbsp;

“Because the times are not so ripe as to allow all of humanity to bear a truth like this. A truth that has always been covered up and ridiculed ».

&amp;nbsp;

**Let's go to 1956: what happened?**

&amp;nbsp;

«It happened that some aliens who lived in a secret base in Pescara manifested themselves to some terrestrials. A few years later, in Milan, where I was directing a well-known art gallery, I became friends with Bruno Sammaciccia, the exponent of the terrestrial group, who, with caution, revealed to me the facts that were happening in Pescara. It changed my wife and I's life. Both being painters, therefore with an open and sensitive mind, we were very happy to ascertain this personally. The aliens accepted us into the group and we spent years learning the ways of their friendship. ""

**That means?**

&amp;nbsp;

""I witnessed not only their surprising manifestations due to a technological level unthinkable for us, but I also learned their way of life: even if they always repeated that they were not perfect, in our eyes all their actions appeared motivated only by love towards Humanity and the Earth, which they call “The Mother Planet” ».

&amp;nbsp;

**Let's start with their technology.**

&amp;nbsp;

In summary, they do not travel in time, as some ridiculous Earth science argues to deny the UFO phenomenon, but between dimensions. Therefore, the messages sent into space by our powers with primitive means that require an infinite time to reach the galaxies are useless: the aliens already know everything about us. They are able to dematerialize and move themselves and objects. They predict short-term, they are telepathic. The W56 knew our thoughts, in 2007 they answered a question of mine. Their spaceships are huge laboratories which, as they wish, show or hide from our view. They are expressed in our languages ​​.... all thanks to a technology acquired over millions of years of evolution. We don't even get to the first step of their experience ».

&amp;nbsp;

**And their, so to speak, spiritual sphere?**

&amp;nbsp;

«Also incomparable to ours. The W56s have a friendly demeanor, they fight very rarely and immediately find the way to make peace. For them to do harm is inconceivable. They don't eat meat, but they always asked us for fruit, as well as other foods, such as vegetables. They extracted vitamins ».

&amp;nbsp;

**Excuse me, were they asking you for food instead of materializing them in an instant?**

&amp;nbsp;

«They wanted this affectionate human collaboration of ours. The friendship, the love they wanted to instill in us served as a form of vital energy for them: the Uredda. Their technology is based on this energy. So we realized that we humans do not know what love is ».

&amp;nbsp;

**Even?**

&amp;nbsp;

«One of them, Sigir, taught me: 'Love is when you don't exist, others exist.' Impossible for us ... ».

&amp;nbsp;

** In 1962, his photo of a UFO became famous.**

&amp;nbsp;

“Scheduled meetings were possible with the W56s. We made one on the roof of my house in Milan. When their aircraft approached, I took photos. Through the writer my friend Dino Buzzati, the Domenica del Corriere made the cover page. The newspaper also circulated in Switzerland and a Swiss family asked to meet me to find out more. I received them a couple of times without telling anything about the aliens. But the W56 wanted them in the group, mother, father and young daughter. A wonderful family, Mrs. Verena was such an evolved and loving person as I have never met on Earth. They remained anonymous until the end ».

&amp;nbsp

**But why want to remain anonymous?**

&amp;nbsp;

«Because, then but also today, we start talking again. People take you for megalomaniacs or crazy, and in certain professions your credibility is taken away from you. They threaten you, they fire you. '

&amp;nbsp;

**Why, especially in the work of cover-up, when the governments said that they do not exist, did the aliens with all their marvelous technology not appear to disprove them in front of the world?**

&amp;nbsp;

“They don't want to, because of their experience. Either a race evolves motu proprio, perhaps with little help, or a disaster happens ».

**That is?**

&amp;nbsp;

«When, on other occasions and eras, they revealed their existence, at the moment there was a kind of evolutionary leap which then turned out to be a boomerang; evolution never happens by virtue of an external mechanism but is a conquest that is only internal, even on a collective level. These aliens have learned their lesson and therefore have made it their duty to respect our free will.

&amp;nbsp;

**Even with governments?**

&amp;nbsp;

""For charity. It should be known that even among the aliens there are opposites, therefore also the malevolent factions. Aliens like the W56s are highly spiritual beings who come to our aid, for example by making our nuclear warheads harmless. Negative aliens, like CTRs, have a very different ideology of how to manage space. It looks like movie stuff, but it is. The researchers found that in the 1940s both factions interacted with the US government. Guess who the American leaders have chosen to collaborate with? Not being evolved, we always act stimulated only by greed for money and power ».

&amp;nbsp;

**On closer inspection, your group, after twenty years of contact with the W56, fell apart and some also had serious mental problems.**

&amp;nbsp;

""Yup. Sammaciccia worked so hard that he got into debt and was also unjustly accused for a question of money. He became very fragile and despotic precisely towards the Swiss family. We were ""human"", we were no longer able to carry out a harmonious collaboration between us, as this type of aliens is perfectly capable of doing ... The W56 had foreseen it and never reproached us for anything, rather thanked us . And we remained friends forever ».",Interview of a witness of an alien encounter spanning 20 years

In conclusion, I have no idea what this is. But my hope is by that compiling this list, just maybe we can get a better picture of what this could be. Or someone with more information might see this and be willing to divulge. I would also like it if we could continue adding new sightings to this list, or any old sightings I have missed.

aliens,"So for years (about 5) I've had [these marks](https://imgur.com/a/sRpNH9z) on my left foot only, despite having changed shoes/socks/sandals etc constantly, they keep reappearing. At one point last year I started placing band-aids on them every single day for months so at no point would they be exposed. It seems to have worked, however I developed new marks an inch above the previous area so I am left wondering what they are. I've used creams and stuff to try to get rid of them but they won't go away, only if I cover them for extended periods of time.

I should also mention, I've been having strange issues for about 10 years now regarding constantly seeing things that aren't there, a recurring theme being aliens, but often it's just really random stuff. For the past year I've been constantly going in and out of hospitals due to random conditions that I've developed and been diagnosed with, e.g. hypothyroidism and retinal detachments despite being in my 20s (apparently my retinas keep getting holes in them for no reason) and I've had to have surgeries due to that. After that I was diagnosed with epilepsy which would explain my hallucinations and other odd sensations and behaviors i exhibit.

I, however, am in the pursuit of more information since none of the treatments I've had for the conditions I've just mentioned have worked. I keep having hallucinations and a myriad of different symptoms. So I just thought I would share this in the hopes someone can relate or give me some insight into other explanations for what is occurring to me. Thanks.",Marks and Hallucinations

it's traveling very slowly from south west to north east above the tree line / LIRR platform ( Long island rail road ) at about 10mph . I had enough time to clearly see the object travel over sunrise highway all the while its changing shapes, mid drift across the sky. i thought it was a balloon at first but it stayed level in the sky with a constant speed at 10 mph on a windy day. i couldn't see any markings as its changing its shape. only the silver/ black color to it. it seemed to be the the size of SUV. which was also a ridiculous size to begin with.

I really have no idea what it could have been other than an unidentified flying object. I'm sure others saw it as well and I hope they're in this sub. anyways I hope some of you can give some insight or personal experience with shape shifting objects. thanks for reading",My Morphing UFO Encounter

aliens,"So back in 2011 i was working at a grocery store and met lots of customers and i seemed to find customers that i got certain things from. I was 17 at the time curious to try any drug. Been smoking pot since 13. So i met this lady. She looked pretty washed up. Said she was 40 but she liiked like she could have been 70. Anyways, fuckin to me, seemed like the coolest lady for the longest time i was just buying pain killers from her. One night, i asked for a bump of crank. I have never done it i always saw her fiddling with a straw and a mirror trying to turn her head as if i wouldn't notice. Then one day i said hey can i try whatever u got goin on once in a while? She started laughing and said 'dude, u ever done this before?'  I said no and she laughed some more and then she gave me a straw and held open a little baggy and said dip that straw in the bag and snort it. Fuckin shit was the most interesting incredible stuff ever. I mean i didnt physically feel invincible, but mentally, i felt 100% like i could talk my way out of anything at any time and i was always pretty happy. Also i was taking 150mg effexor so im sure that and the crank mixed was like a fuckin dynamic combination of something that kinda had me running like i was on auto poilet. I would love going to work, no problem, loved going to sleep unless i didnt have a little sumthin for the next morning, and i loved waking up knowing i had my fix ready to take me through the day. I started buying so much off this lady and then she introduces me to this man. Big huge dude about 6'8 looked like about 350 pounds. Just looked like an everyday type of guy. Crank never even came to my kind when i met him, i would've never thought. So one night the lady had me go get her some crank . She asked if i could do her that favor. So i pulled up and it was the big huge dude so i started talkin to him and i asked him if he worked. He said yea, ive been an electricial contractor for 34 years. Young lookin guy looked like he was maybe 45-50. I asked him how old he was he said 55. And he was so on his shit and then i asked for his number and started buying it every week i would buy my week supply. Then about a half year went by as i continued to use. One morning, i got a knock at the door and it was the fuckin strangest thing. I see these 2 men walking up to the house with black suits and ties. One old, slightly bald looked like he may have been in his 70s. Other guy was standing next to him. Looked a little bit like news reporter (mike nicco). They were very good looking men. Im not a gay guy, but i mean these dudes looked like they were from a straight laboratory. Perfect facial features, body structures, body language... everything. So before they knocked on the door i saw them walking up to the porch. Onced they knocked, it was the fuckin most bizzare shit ever. You know how a knock sounds. Knock, knock, knock. Well there were 5 knocks and they came with 5 wierd syllables. Knock(skitz) knock (oh) knock(fren) knock(ee) knock(ah). Sounded like the word schiz-o-phrenia. So i opened the door and they said they were jehovah's witnesses and the asked if i wanted a bible study. After hearing that wicked horrifying sounding knock, i played it off as if nothing happened, but being so confused and shocked, i said sure. So i said come on  in the house. We were still sitting on the couch and shit got stranger.. the old man started sitting real close to me and started rubbing my left knee real softly as he was gazing up into my eyes. And started telling me how jehovah is the creator of the universe and he knows how many hair particles everyone has and how good of a good he was. How jehovah loves everyone and forgives everyone. Some typical bibal toad talk that i would hear. But there were weird undertones i could hear and once i noticed them, they started popping out of every sentence. For example. 'He would say god is great and loves and forgives everything'. And then i heard an echo of his voice lingering like it was bouncing off of some wall or i dont even know, but all i know is it sounded loud and clear ('we are not a force of god, we are satanic and we are here to tell you that you are our little lamb. Our test subject.') And also stuff like ('yeah, were just big airheads bub. And just because we have technology were gonna use it on you.') This schizophrenia got so bad within 3 days people were asking me if i could please pull the lever. Then it went from that to screaming voices sounding like a mass of millions of people chanting all at the same time and they were screaming to me. Go pull the lever get it over with already because if you dont within the next 10 minutes, i will have no possibility of making it to heaven what so ever! So i went in the garage, grabbed my dads electric saw, plugged it in and went straight towards my Adams apple. After that i was wondering why i was still alive and i touched my neck to see if i felt blood and nope. But there was a safety mechanism that wouldnt let the blade shred through anything but leaves and small branches. Anyways i can tell u on and on about what happened. But to make it short i went through many emergency rooms and psych wards for about 7 years straight. But today i am 26 years old and i am lucky to tell you guys about this daunting story. For the last 2 and a half years, I have been living comfortably without fear. Now thats all i have. Pull the lever means (put an end).

The first video we filmed today at 20:00 PM CEST time, 24th of April 2020. My mom was sitting chatting with her neighbor, when they noticed a light appearing out of thin air basically. You can see at the 9 sec mark it dropped what appears to be a smaller orb of some kind. Look at it and decide for yourself what it is (flare? maybe, but flares make a trail and do get carried by the wind at those heights, drones? nah too bright of a light). But dont judge untill you look at the second video.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTs6yEi8sVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTs6yEi8sVA)

This second video was filmed by a kid and his dad at a different neighborhood, at roughly the same time. He conntacted me, saying he saw the same thing in that direction with his dad and they took the video. You can see what appears to be a diamond shape when the camera focuses on it. You can also notice towards the end that the object is indeed moving with a strange path if you track it relative to the branches seen in the corner( although there is a camera wobble present).

All in all this was the first time ever i've seen something like this.

aliens,"I have seen 4 UFO's in my life, I am 25 years old and I hope to see more of them lol. The most recent one, is the one I want to share. The family and I were down South Carolina for vacation in Mrytle Beach, we came from Maryland. We stayed for a week and on our 3rd night there we went down to the beach to look for sand crabs and anything else that washed up from the Atlantic Ocean, plus we wanted to do some fishing. There was 7 of us all together on the beach and out of no where there was this bright orange-ish light that got super bright right over us, like a star just came out of nowhere, it was a super bright orange color... Me and Pops were exicted because we love UFO stuff and my Aunt actually got scared because of how big and bright it was... everyone else just couldn't believe it. It only stayed for half a second and vanished. About 6 mins later we see blinking lights coming towards us from far away and we thought it was another UFO so we were watching it and I realized it was most likely a plane because of the way it was blinking, as it got closer we seen it was a plane, a military plane and we seen on the top was a radar dish, and I knew right away it was the Boeing E-3 sentry which is a early warning and control plane. It has extremely good radar technology on the top and it was flying in a circle right above us where we saw the bright orange light. It stayed for about 15 mins just flying in a circle pattern around where we saw the bright object. It could of been a training mission and just getting the pilots some practice but it was midnight and I don't think it was a coincidence that it was flying right around where we saw the bright orange light. Sometimes the Air Force does testing at late hours but most of the time its done during the day or the evening. I think it was trying to track whatever that bright orange light was. It didn't look like a drone or any craft, it was just a bright orange light... like a orange star just popped up over us on the beach. It was a awesome experience, when we seen the Orange light I got a weird feeling right away, like something telling me that it was something not from our planet. I have 3 more times that I have seen a UFO, this time was the craziest one because the Military Boeing E-3 came looking for it.",SOUTH CAROLINA UFO

Anyway on the the story. It was at last 3 months ago when this happened, I was on the way home from a friend house at around 10:30, I was walking back with two of my friends they were dating so I was kinda the third wheel on the way home, they live on the opposite side of the neighborhood so the pool area was in the middle of the neighborhood and split into two streets and I had to go the other way so I tell my friends goodbye and left, it was like 3 minutes later when I started to feel watched so I started to look around and I had a feeling to look up, (it was the biggest mistake) I looked up and there was a big white orb in the sky, it was so close I felt like I could throw a rock at it and hit it, I was standing there alone at 10 at night with a white orb above me it was a good minute of me in shock of what I was looking at, then it just flu out of there in speeds a helicopter or airplane couldn’t reach, it also left white streaks of light behind it , I started balling my eyes out and calling my friends to come help me, they were at my side in 2 minutes ,( they haven’t walked that far from me ), 4 days passed from that day and I was walking home with my friend this time, he didn’t really believe my story but agreed with me anyways, it was at 11 o’clock or something were he stop and said wtf is that, I looked up and there it is but much smaller, I flu off again and we were the in shock I was crying again Bc memories of the other night came back, my friend grabbed my arm and we ran to my house and when we got there my mom only saw a boy pale white and me crying my eyes out again, we dropped him off at his house because he was to scared to go on foot.

aliens,"I have been having very strange dreams lately of just normal stuff when all of the sudden i see glimpses of aliens/spaceships/ being on an examination bed and then it turns back to the dream, even in the dream i'm confused about what happend, for example last night i was first dreaming about driving a car then all of the sudden running to a building that was getting farther and farther away from me, the first glimpse came, *poof* inside of the building where there were two extremely similair tall human guards, another glimpse, and then i was in some sort of lockerroom. The weirdest part in my opinion is that in the dream i was wearing everyday clothing with my hair tied up in a bun, but in the glimpse i was in my sweatpants and hait untied, the exact same as i went to bed with. The last glimpse was also the longest where i could hear some speech in a sort of clicking/chirping way before waking up in my bed at 2:39AM
Everytime i had these ""dreams"" i woke up between 2:30AM and 3:00AM

aliens,"Like the title says, I had an experience this morning and I'm not sure where to go or who or even what to ask. So I thought I'd post it here and see what comes up or if anyone has had a similar experience.

So around 4:30 this morning my dog decides he needs to pee. Fuck. Normally wake up at 6 a.m. but he was being insistent. So I take him outside.

I'm outside, look to my left and I see a group of 'people' just past the fence on the neighbors side, walking away from my house. Now that fence is about low chest level with me and I'm 5'9. On these people it's about middle of head height. So I'm thinking a group of kids. But what the heck would a group of kids be doing out walking at 4:30 in the morning?

A couple of odd things. First was the silence. There were about 6 of them and none of them were saying a damned thing. If anyone has been around a group of kids, it's a friggin chorus of noise coming out of their yap holes at all times.  The second was the way they were walking. It was almost like walking wasn't .... natural. I almost want to say a drunk stagger but I know drunk stagger well (before you ask, I wasn't drunk, I haven't been drunk in over 10 years so it wasn't any drink vision) and it wasn't a drunk stagger.  And then one of the 'kids' passed near the light of the street light and he had some weird hair. Like, he had almost no hair but the hair that he had was very thin and whispy. Like he was a cancer patient or something?

Like I said I have no idea what to make of it. I don't want to say aliens, I mean, do they go for a stroll early morning in cities? I have no idea.

Anyone have any ideas what the hell this could have been, if it's not weird, quiet, 10 year olds going for a walk at 4:30 in the morning?","I have no idea where to post or who to ask about this experience, so I'll start here."

-Leaders and members quick to attack anyone who speaks ill of the cult. (Bill Ryan, DJ, Joe from the Carolinas, Cliff High, Jay Weidner, etc..)

-Ask for donations. Corey asked for half a million dollars in donations to write a comic book. He also did a fundraiser for his wife's birthday present?

-Keep certain content behind paywall or practice timed releases of material. (You get earlier access to ""disclosure"" if you pay $200 for conference tickets or live streaming. Others must wait several weeks for this info)

-Shunned and attacked when asking for proof. 

-Everything the leader claims has to be accepted strictly on faith

-Members are taught not to trust any unnaproved media outlets. 

-Leaders wont make public appearances unless they control the conversation. (Corey's interviews are only conducted by those who buy into his material)

-Marketing campaigns. (Go look at his website and FB page. Also he's discussed creating material for children as if 10 year olds need to be exposed to this silliness)

aliens,"So a few of you mentioned something on a video I made a few days back about the UFO poster on tiktok, that has been running through my head, about the possibility of us seeing a higher dimensional object coming in and out of the 3d plane as the video was slowed down. It’s interesting that one of the posters mentions slowing the video down further than I did and noticing the same “electricity-like” effects, which I attributed to possibly being a result of compression - but I did see in the original video that there were moving pixels at points as if something was moving in those areas when I first looked at it - at first I thought this meant sloppy splicing, but because the rest of the time the image is perfectly smooth with no Pixelization - 

It brought me to a thought:

Time is considered in theory to be regarded as the 4th dimension. 

So if this a higher dimensional object and we can control the “frame rate” of one of the dimensions - i.e “Time” - maybe there is some way we can catch things in high dimensional spaces by changing the frame rate of speed from the normal frame rate in film at which the human eye  can more easily perceive things  - which is believed to be best between 30-60frames per second. Here’s a good video on how we perceive things with our eyes in relation to camera frame rates: 
[YouTube - how the eye perceives motion in relation to Frame rates ](https://youtu.be/FhSHeYT2U70) 

Now knowing that it will be harder for us to see things moving at extremely high speeds without our brain adding a blur in the objects motions or basically going so far as to making an object seen still - what if we can perceive glimpses of higher dimensional objects by either filming at higher frame rates and then slowing down the footage or slowing down any footage in general and analyzing each individual frame - (as long as the software isn’t doing something like optical flow and adding frames to make the footage more smooth looking). 

Suggestion to everyone: all of our  iPhones shoot in 120fps - some dslr’s go well above that - if possible when shooting something set your i phone to the highest frame rate and let’s start slowing down some existing footage in general and seeing if anything weird starts coming into our field of perception from the process.
This should also make future video sightings easier to analyze.","Possible idea regarding Time, higher dimensional objects - and recording UFO/UAP sightings in higher frame rates to enable better analysis of future sightings. Thoughts?"

My theory is this: Grey aliens are created by higher dimensional beings in order to interact with us on Earth in this dimension. My idea is that Greys are really like autonomous clones that the higher dimensional beings are able to control (hence the hive mind theory). The higher dimensional beings want to be able to interact with this dimension so they create these beings to do their ""dirty work"".

[**https://youtu.be/QYhRu2\_nJ6c**](https://youtu.be/QYhRu2_nJ6c) 

A lot to go through here. Just finished reading the Day after Roswell and much of what Corso seems to correspond with what Tom says that MacCasland and many other brass have communicated to him.   


Quote for reference:  
 ""It was the cold war and every single day we lived under the threat of nuclear war. Every single day we believed and really thought in the deepest part our souls thought that nuclear war could happen.... and somewhere in those years, we found a life form, and everything we did and every decision that we made with that life form was because of the consciousness a the time."" When asked about the nuclear weapons and when the phenomenon turned them on to fire he said: ""There are heros in Russia, heros, and under grave risk to self and country... they didn't fire back.""    


If Corso's son viewed ETs as a threat in the interview with Greer, what was it that formed Greer's opinion that they are ""Space Bros""? Just the meditation experiences that he has had where the deer looking ET came and hugged him or whatever? Does Greer only view them as Space Bros or acknowledge that some of them may be hostile?

aliens,"Think about it... We're the only species that we know of that have these things. What if something like music is so unique in the universe, aliens have no idea what it is? Things like movies and special effects may also be intriguing to them, because their evolution of technology may have skipped stuff like that altogether. They may not even be able to tell the difference between a special effect and reality.

We like to think aliens would be so advanced that everything we have would be primitive to them, but that's inaccurate. We may have things they never even imagined developing, and may not even have the technology to replicate.

Here's another analogy; We study the properties of certain animals all the time, and try to mimic them, or create technology based on them. There are many creatures that have physiological functions superior to ours, usually in a very specific way. Like a spider's silk being stronger than steel, or ants being able to carry 10x their weight.

aliens,"Last night, around 2am, me and a friend of mine were driving around our local area. I live near farmland, so we were driving through the long winding roads, good for speeding and whatnot. At one of the bends, I noticed something or someone sitting on the road barrier. At first, I thought it was a plastic bag because it was quite crinkly, shiny, and a dark greyish colour. It disappeared after my lights turned the corner. We didn't really think much of it, probably was just a bag or something. Then, about 100m out from the road to the right, we saw this large, extremely glossy egg-shaped thing rise into the sky, stop, then went west from where we were at astronomical speeds. We both shat ourselves and I sped home. Never seen anything like that in my entire life, and joined this sub specifically to gain some insight on what the frick I saw.

Now I've always believed in aliens, but this ""evidence"" that always pops up never seems legit and always has holes in the story.

aliens,"I mean title says it all but it's so wild to me that Tom DeLonge dedicated his life to UFOs. I've summed up his story below:

Around May of 2020, the Pentagon officially released three short videos in order to “clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real.”

Luis Elizondo, the former head of a now classified UFO program for the DOD, claims that ""these aircraft -- we'll call them aircraft -- are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the US inventory nor in any foreign inventory that we are aware of."" Elizondo says he resigned in 2017 in protest over the secrecy surrounding the UFO program.

And the man responsible for the original circulating footage? You guessed it: Tom DeLonge, Former member of Blink-182.

Stories of DeLonge reading about alien contact &amp; UFO’s while on Blink’s tour bus seem to hint that he knew even in the earliest stages of their stardom that he would one day leave it all to pursue his passion.

In response to his critics after he made the switch: “Would I leave rock and roll just to go do something that there's no data for and it's just, like, pie in the sky and we're just imagining things? No! Why would I? That's insane. But would I leave it for something that I truly think can change the world and have a positive impact and make it a better place, and something that needs to be dealt with, something that's serious?""

DeLonge founded the To the Stars Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences with Elizondo in 2017, right after Blink-182 broke up for the second time in 2015. The Academy’s main goal is to “collect documents and physical materials from public and private sources related to the UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) to study it and then transition the transformative technologies behind it to wider applications of public benefit.” What does that mean? They find the suspicious videos the government’s been hiding from us and publish it with as much authentic verification as possible.

In fact, DeLonge feels that the government acted the way they did this year because of the investigative work of the Academy. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he claimed the higher ups at the Pentagon are saying, “alright it’s time to start talking about it because Tom and his rascals are putting our feet to the fire.” The video he feels is the most important release? This one.

Even (soon to be FORMER) President Trump mentioned the footage claiming it was “a hell of a video.”

Some sauces: New York Times article (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/science/tom-delonge-ufo-research.html) and Rolling Stone article (https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/tom-delonge-ufo-video-pentagon-release-blink-182-994370/).",Tom DeLonge (former member of Blink-182) was responsible for Pentagon UFO Footage from May 2020
aliens,"⛔️*Disclaimer: This is my own opinion and if u don’t agree that’s okay* this is just a theory and nothing said is 100% correct or real*⛔️

Let me just start off by saying that the most common alien sightings are grey aliens and the ufos are mostly from the greys. 🛸 

The grey aliens are a very intelligent race of E.Ts, they are thousands of years more advanced than we are. They come from a star system called Zeta Reticuli. It’s unknown if they live / harvest all the planets from that star system but they are definitely space bound. So technically they are called Zeta Reticulians. 
Grey aliens are more spiritually aware and understand the different dimensions (including the Astral plane). They know if you are remote viewing them and can even speak to you telepathically. 
Greys are around 3ft tall, have big black eyes and huge heads. Depending on their ‘race’ they come in different colours. Grey, mustard colour and green. Their bodies are genetically altered and they transfer Their consciousness to stay ‘alive’. The greys harvest are genetic code to make human hybrids and do other stuff that is unknown.
**R/Skinnybob is a good sub to check out what they look like**

The greys have bases around the universe and even one inside are moon, that’s why u see them a lot here. I personally feel like they are already in contact with the reptilians here on planet earth.

aliens,"So when I was about 4-5 years old I lived in a two story house in somewhere Fort Worth. I remember this one night I honestly don’t know why but I guessed it scared me to the point where’d I’d remember it today exactly how it went. So one night my mom was tucking me into my bed and I was on my back the sheets were to my arms and she turned out the lights and closed the door. My bed was in the left corner of the room from my door. When I thought I was sleeping, I immediately saw my whole room but it was like I was in the top corner of my bed just seeing my whole room. I couldn’t move or do anything. But I legitimately saw myself laying in my bed. When I noticed myself laying there I was terrified. I saw this bright light come from my ceiling and then three black figures came out of the light. I had a little pink flower rug in the middle of my room. That’s where the light was peaking from and that’s where those things came from. I saw them fold my sheets back in a certain way and pick me up in the cradle position and lay me on my flower rug. They had my arms and legs spread out in the star fish position. They were lifting up my shirt about half way enough to get to my stomach. But before I saw their faces.

aliens,"My whole life I would randomly get these reoccurring dreams. It would start out as me dreaming that I woke up with extreme anxiety and ran to my parents room. As I went to their room all the furniture in the house would start spinning and then boom all of a sudden I was in this entirely white space. It was bright white all around me but it had no corners or flat walls like a room. There was other children there and these all white tall faceless beings where picking up all us children and sticking us upside down in the “ceiling” of this white space. I remember being stuck there it had a texture. A really smooth almost silky corn starchy texture. 

Now when ever I touch something in real life that vaguely feels like that texture from the dream I freak out a little. During the entire dream I would feel the absolute worst anxiety and fear that I’ve ever experienced. 

In the dream when I woke up and went to my parents room I always thought that it was real and was actually going to my parents room 

NOW, here is the weirdest part. EVERY single time I’ve had this dream, where has to be dozens of times over my life, my parents would find me out in our front yard staring at the sky mumbling. i guess during the dream I would sleep walk out there but it’s strange because our yard isn’t the easiest to navigate. 

Now here is when my family and friends started suggesting alien abduction. I grew up with an autonomic disorder that makes me faint and have weird pains so we started getting MRIs. At this point in time I had already had two MRIs where they said they found a small harmless cyst in the front of my brain. We went in for another one months later and the doctor overseeing it freaked out. He started asking my family if I had brain surgery before (I have not) but he insisted we were lying. He said that he could not see the left side of my brain in the MRI because it was being blocked out by something metallic which is usually only seen in patients who have had metal plates in their heads after accidents. He went and checked my past MRI scans and told us the metallic thing was blocking out half my brain in those too. My moms moms went immediately to her memories of finding me staring at the sky in the front yard and my weird dreams. 

This wasn’t completely off the table because my grandfather had a similar thing happen to him which baffled doctors. They had found a cyst in the front of his brain as well and removed it. When they removed it they found that it was a gelatinous blob encasing this weird metal thing that didn’t seem organic. The doctors never found out what it was. That same grandpa and the rest of that side of the family had also had a weird experience with “missing time” they were driving through this remote area on the way home from a road trip which they did yearly. It was about 2 o’clock and then all of a sudden it was four hours later...but they were on the same spot. They have no idea what happened. 

Has anyone had experiences like this or a similar dream?",Reoccurring dream/ possible alien abduction???

aliens,"Why the time traveller explanation of the ufo phenomenon makes a lot of sense:

The theory is that ufos are humans from the future either observing and/or changing the future.

- continued interest in nuclear sites (can't have us killing our future selves).

- minimal contact policy. (Don't want to influence the future except when necessary for survival or advancement).

-men in black (humans from the future enforcing secrecy to ensure minimal impact on future timelines).

- continued interest in earth (why would any e.t.s give a damn about us to warrant a decades [or centuries] long presence on earth?  It makes sense why time travelling humans would care.)

Ufos remain mysterious, despite reports of them persisting for decades.  It seems great effort is put into keeping them a mystery.  The time traveller theory, I think, is the best current explanation for why it is necessary for ufos to remain a mystery.  Time travellers would not want to drastically alter their timeline, but would alter it when it fits their agenda.",Time travelling humans makes sense

aliens,"I've heard about the WOW! Signal for a little while now, and researching more about it, I've deduced it is a strong candidate for an Alien transmission (either accidental or intentional- I believe the first.) 

We know it is in the realm of possibility- somewhat- but the problem with this is, we are in a submarine with no periscope. We can't see the outside world (to see any type of life in the ocean), we can only hear or detect things.  

That is why it's impossibly hard to detect things in space. The WOW! Signal could be Alien-Life, but there is no telescope to zoom in to even see the planet or solar system (or Alien ship, if it was some message deep in space.). We don't know if this was from a message MILLIONS of years old- (traveling from another galaxy, even.)

We don't know what we are dealing with, but it seems that we know that this has all the checkmarks for an Alien radio transmission, that either turned on or shut off when one of the feed-horns on the Big-Ear was looking at it (we don't know where exactly the noise came from.). 

If it is from an Alien civilization a couple of blocks away from our solar system, then this might be all we will ever know. We can't travel there (I know I won't be alive when we visit other stars). We've sent a reply in 2012 (even though it was a bit weird), but that will take years and years to reach. I'm about 99% certain we will probably never get a reply- or, if we did, we probably won't be looking for it for the next 20 years or so when the reply would reach us. 

There are just so many things here, but to the question, has there been any other explanation that can still hold up. (I know the comets one has been pretty much debunked). So is there ANYTHING else that could be on the table besides Aliens? Or are we at the greatest discovery of human history, and we didn't even know it 40 years ago? If that's the case, it didn't take us too long to find Aliens, if it is.",Any Updates on the WOW! Signal?

aliens,I think i had an encounter 2 years ago. It happened when i was watching 3 cherry red orbs moving across the sky. I will explain it from the beginning. I am sort of a wildlife fan and go out regularly at night to spot owls deer foxes and other wildlife in my area. I live in a coastal area with dunes and a small forest 1 night i was cycling to the dunes to spot some foxes that where active in the area at the time (mating season). I was standing on the top of a dune when i noticed three cherry red orbs hovering stationary over the sea and quite in the distance. Initially i thought they could be aircraft coming in to land at the airport because i see them regularly flying the same approach path. I paid little attention to it and continued to watch for foxes. About 10 minutes went by when i noticed 1 of the orbs going away from the remainder of the two and was apparently coming closer to the coastline.  It moved through the sky without flashing lights or any change in brightness not flickering like a Chinese lantern would. This movement continues for about 5 minutes and then it stopped i found this unusual and i got the thought well maybe this isn't an airplane. At the time it was still pretty far away from me 10 kilometers or more i think. When it suddenly started moving again along the coastline coming towards my position. The other 2 orbs where still hanging above the ocean stationary but this one was coming towards me. At this moment my attention was completely on this red orb. It came closer and closer until it stopped about 500 meters from my position (maybe less but it was at night and i couldn't make a good estimate of the distance) i was just staring at this thing hovering completely silently above the dunes prety close to me. It had a constant brightness and a cherry red glow not like a light but just appeared cherry red. I guess that about 5 minutes went by when it appeared to come down a bit and then stopped again. At this point i got a bit nervous because i could not explain it rationally maybe it's nothing but at this time all the frogs birds and other critters went dead silent. I continued staring at this thing going over in my head what i could be? When i suddenly heard some movement to my left. I looked immediately to my left to see what appears to be a small figure not taller than 150cm looking at me i couldn't see a neck but only the shape of a head (big in contrast to a human) torso and arm's that appeared relatively long. I must admit i got frightened so i run towards my bike and sprinted away as fast as i could. I looked back while sprinting away to see this red orb slowly following me for about 10 minutes. At a distance of about 100 meters i think. I sprinted as fast as i could on my bike until i reached some populated area at this point the orb suddenly was nowhere to be seen. I must admit that i immediately went to my house  i couldn't sleep for two days after this... and for fear of ridicule i haven't told anybody except a good friend of mine this. I still cannot explain what happened that night... so thats why i post this now here. And maby get some more answers on this one. I am thinking about this experience almost every day i hope you guys can help me out a bit....,I cannot get this out of my head
aliens,"For the simple fact that this is mentally exhausting to think of and now to translate those thoughts into words will just increase this.

So for this thought experiment, set the limit to only 1 Type VI Civilisation within existence (to prevent a mental breakdown, panic attacks, existential thinking, all that's good stuff).

1 Civilisation, on a planet within a solar system that supports life. The positioning and the nature of the inhabited planet (effective ecosystem, low/ no geothermal danger, low air and marine pollution) and the environment within the solar system (debris, asteroid belts, other planets/ dwarf planets) would allow its life to progress and evolve without/ or with few extinction events. 

Provided it had these settings and has been around as long as Earth or earlier it would advance up the Kardashev Scale much quicker (quicker in a Universe/ Existential sense) and more efficiently (taking into account that there would be human defects like flawed politics, corruption, war for resource rather than necessity). 

My personal conclusion from this is that ""God"" is real and unfathomable like many people and stories have told us before, but that it is unfathomable due to its complexity and is omnipresent/ omnipotent due to advanced power from eons of progression.

Being multidimensional, with the ability to step out of the time/ space construct, create and destroy universe's and the ability to alter reality/ realities it seems they have to be God and that I cant even question a ""what else"".

As soon as I ent to flick my lighter to light up my cigarette I saw a dark figure standing about 12 to 15 ft from me. It was the size of a 5 or 6 year old kid with big glowing eyes it had a slim small body and its arms were on its sides. I stood there in shock and couldn't move because I as scared as shit and couldn't believe what I was seeing, we made eye contact and then the alien move and then I moved in shocked and I scream in my head like wtf is that, then the alien began to move backwards hovering over my grass backyard like it was moon walking like Michael Jackson but his two legs were parallel and wasn't moving it was hovering above the ground moving backwards the whole time still facing me until it went into the shadows of my backyard. I hurried up and slam the door and locked it.

aliens,"Just got reddit and wanted to share my experience. I was staying up at my cottage alone for the week. It was a hot night and I couldn't sleep so I decided to take a pillow and lay on the shoreline to watch the stars. After a few minutes I saw a satellite-type object coming out of the south horizon. It moved at variable speeds, hovering at times, making small loops, moving straight at times, very erratic. It continued moving this way until it was directly overhead (took around 15 mins total to travel that distance). Then it slowly made its way back towards the east.

My cottage is on an isolated bay with open water for about a km until there are 2 islands. As I was watching this first object I saw a bright light glowing through the trees of the right island, then a white orb roughly 25 feet in diameter came into view (nothing blocked my line of sight) it crossed the open section of water while making no noise. It illuminated the shoreline while hovering at a constant 5-10 feet above the water and followed the shoreline of the left island (island is under 100 feet) before disappearing around the far side of the island, light could still be seen glowing through the trees. It then came into view once more as it crossed the open water in the opposite direction as the first time. In view for roughly 1 minute. It did not land or stop, did not see it come down or go up. After this event there were around 10 objects similar to the first scattered throughout the sky at varying altitudes. I continued watching for over an hour before going inside to go to the bathroom, when I came back out they were gone.

They didn't seem like a ship of any kind. They were just glowing white spheres, but without a distinct place they were glowing from, more like a gradient of bright in the middle fading to dimmer at the outside. However, the ones that were farther away sometimes seemed to give the impression of facing a certain direction, even then it was unclear any distinct shape but more of a feeling.

When this started happening I didn't have my phone on me, so in a desperate attempt to leave some sign, I took coins out of my pocket and laid them in a long line in case I disappeared. I remember thinking that the end of the world comes slowly, as I sat there waiting to see what would happen. At one point I ran inside to get my water bottle and a peach, thinking it might be my last meal. Afterwards, still not knowing what would happen, I quickly texted my parents that I was at peace and happy. Luckily I'm still here to share this story.

This experience has left me with a lot of unanswered questions. I don't know whether it was a ship or not, whether it was being piloted or not, whether it came from earth or not.

Now a billion feels like a step up from a million. But it's supposed to feel way longer than that. I turned them into seconds then days to put it into perspective 

A million seconds is roughly 11 days 
A billion seconds is 31,000 YEARS

Some humans would probably make a deal with Aliens to not show their existence, the aliens would probably have a translator for languages.

If extra terrestrial were to come here they would more than likely not send biological life first.

I’m sure they would want to send something like this first before they would be willing to travel the amazing distance to get here.

They can probably help us fix nearly all diseases that are killing millions of people each ear and depriving millions more from having a normal life.

""They want people to know that we’re actually making harm on this world and we mustn’t get too technologed"". Well, they can easily help us protect the environment by giving us technologies that would render the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy obsolete, but no, they keep it all for themselves, in sharp contrast with their supposed care for the environment. Even worse, they want us to stay as primitive as possible. They murder our livestock with blatant disregard for property and work put into raising that property. They also do it with extreme cruelty, which also is in contrast with their supposed care for the life on this planet. They also abduct humans, attack poor people in jungles to aggressively take samples. They also have murdered pilots who are in their right to protect our airspace, as if to say ""we're off limits, you can't touch us"". Worst of all, I think is their serious interest in our defense technologies and abilities. Numerous accounts of UFO's flying near war zones, nuclear experiment sites, nuclear ships and power plants. The fact that they stole a goddamn torpedo under the nose of the people retrieving it. The fact that they disable the controls of nuclear weapons facility.

aliens,"Okay, I'd never expect myself to be putting myself out there like this but I want to know if it was all a dream or not.

One night, a while ago I had this weird dream, I remember it pretty well still. I went to sleep, like any other night but my dream wasn't so random and crazy with me flying or fighting a weird spider human hybrid (true story, I know strange) it was something different.

I was in a room, which was white and seemed endless to me. I was with these quite small grey aliens. They were about knee height, and I was not scared of them. In fact, I had absolutely no fear in my body. I felt high, just super loopy and happy. I started kicking them off of me playfully until they directed me to this operating table of the sort. It was made of some sort of weird material, not metal but still looked and felt like it. White, cold, and I had bright white lights shining in my eyes. I remember the aliens left, and these other ones came in. I honestly cant remember what they looked like, all I know is that they were a lot taller than me. Keep in mind I'm pretty short, about 5'2 and they seemed about maybe just less than 6' to me. I dont remember after that what they did, all I remember was waking up and thinking what a weird dream that was.

So, why would they (if it was real) take me? Let's look at the facts

- I'm half British and half Asian
- I'm pretty short
- My family is just below average in wealth
- I'm good with the arts

Those are the only things about me that I can think of that separates me from the rest of most people I know, so why would they choose me? Not too sure. However, I do have some other stuff going on with me.

So it sounds mad, please dont judge me but my skin gets tight or itchy whenever I'm around a big amount of electricity. When I was younger, I'd do a trick where I'd electric shock my friends, may have been because of the clothes I was wearing? And let's just say some other abnormal stuff I dont want to get into. Anyway, this may have increased when I had that dream, I'm not too sure. About a month ago I heard this cracking sound like a radio for a second and it went away. Sometimes my brains gets interfered by electricity pulses.

Anyway, please dont think I'm crazy, chances are this was all a dream and I'm just overthinking everything!",did I experience an abduction?

Stay awake so they can’t get you. You don’t want to wake up with the fragmented memories. Was it a dream? Can’t be. I have strange scars on my body in the shape of a perfect straight line, thin and about an inch long, barely noticeable. A new one every night. This isn’t natural. 

More caffeine.

Maybe it was a dream, but I can’t get the faces out of my mind. In that place with bright colors and weird animals. Neon colored buildings and nature all around me.
Bright green and yellow lizard like creatures with red eyes and sharp teeth chasing me around. My shoes were missing. They were biting at my ankles, they were fast like snakes. Cat sized frog like animals hopping all around me, they would squish and puff back out if you stepped on them. They were slimy.

I was running around confused trying to get away from these animals then I ran into the monster that was tearing into some of the buildings.

That thing saw me and now that thing was chasing me. I was terrified. It was like a cross between the Hulk and a yeti, with white and black fur.

Then I got to the yellow and black beach, the sky was cloudy and grey. Mist from the gray pale water. There were men in suits with sunglasses on. They looked human, but when they put those weird binoculars on me the 50 or so “people” in suits showed their true form. 

Orange Faces, huge Eyes, slits for a mouth and nose, smiling faces and 4 fingered hands with skinny arms and legs akin to typical green little men only they were orange, skinny and the height of your average human. Some had hair and some were bald. Some faces had wrinkles and there was variety in the beings appearance. Some faces were smooth. As if some were pure whatever-their-race-was and some of them were crossbred with humans. They were glad I was frightened. All smiling.Paralyzed in fear or perhaps they forced me to stay still. One gets close and injects me with something. I woke up. With a new scar.

That was last night. Not again.

Maybe that large meteor I saw last week wasn’t a meteor.

I think if we can prove our space faring capabilities then aliens will finally consider us worthy to be revealed too or maybe a threat. Especially some of the hypersonic missiles and nuclear bombs that Russia and North Korea are testing might make E.T. a bit nervous if they care at all.

aliens,"This is gonna get long, bear with me here. 

I've had a few encounters in my life; A little man coming out of my closet and staring at me when I was a child, dreams about getting abducted, seeing weird lights in the sky. But these past couple weeks have been the most eventful, and the scariest weeks I've probably had. 

I have a friend whom I work with, we'll call him N. One day, N and another coworker came over to my apartment complex late at night (we work night shifts). They saw an animal, one with long ears like a rabbit. But claimed that it was too large, and much too fast to be a rabbit. It had run across the complex and disappeared into the woods. As soon as they got out of there car and were about to open the door to my building, they heard an almost human like scream coming from the same direction the animal came from. I did not see the animal this time so I can't confirm that the one I saw later was the same. 

Last night, weeks after that first incident, I was driving home with N in my car from work. Our commute is pretty much a straight drive, except for one other turn at a light. In between our work and that light, there's a Mcdonald's and then five minutes down the road, right before the light, there's a gas station. We have no memory of the drive from Mcdonald's to that gas station. We ended up at the light, both looked at eachother, and asked how we got there so quick. It was like we had been picked up from McDonald's and just dropped at the light. And we tried to reassure ourselves that maybe we were just on auto pilot but it still felt off. 

N stayed at my apartment for about an hour, and then I took him home, which is about a ten minute drive there. Driving home by myself, I felt this extremely overwhelming feeling of dread. Something just felt off. Something still feels off even now. I made it to my complex and as soon as I opened my car door, there were two, short, almost human like screams off in the woods and my heart dropped. I ran into my building and that was all of the events from that night. 

Tonight, I drove N home again. We talked randomly the whole car ride and then noticed that by the time we drove by that same gas station, we had actually remembered the full car ride home. I asked him to describe the animal that they had seen to me, because I hadn't questioned it before. Finally, I was driving home by myself. In our complex, there's multiple buildings and a loop, almost like a round a bout. On one end of the round a bout, there was an animal. It was probably the size of two cats. I can't recall if it had a tail but it had long ears like a rabbit, but a neck that looked too long to be one. It's very dark outside the complex, but i believe that it was a gray or brownish colour. But instead of running across the circle, it did a slow, crouch like walk and sat at the other end and stared at me as I drove by. As I was getting ready to exit my car once again, I swear I saw something speed past the back of my car through my side mirror. 

This could all be very coincidental. No one actually thinks anything of it when I tell them about all of these events, other than that I'm possibly crazy. But both me and N are experiencing the same things, and neither of us know what to think of it.

aliens,"Imagine being the only thing in existence, just a dot in a vast void. You look all around you and you see nothing. How can you tell what is you and what is not you? It is impossible to do so without anything else being there. There is no way to define anything other than your own awareness of being there. So everything in that moment can easily be described as ""you"".

Now, imagine the same scenario but in the world, you're living in now. You look around you and you see things, that is obviously not a part of ""you"" because you have a body. It is easy to define what is you and what is not you. So everything in that moment is separated.

These are just two thought experiments I have, and I'm just interested in what I can do with them. The idea I'm attempting to explain is from many cultures around the world. These ideas are brought on by self-reflection and meditation. The word ""sunyata"" in Sanskrit means emptiness or voidness. Which, it is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditative state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience. There is another term called ""Maya"" which means ""deceit"". Mayans and Buddhists claim that the world is Maya or an illusion.

I believe that during intense meditative states, one is able to achieve a higher state of consciousness. During these higher states of self-awareness, the mind is able to perceive a higher order of thoughts. If the entire world is you, and you are able to tap into this state with mediation or discipline. Then, whatever we have learned as whole, we are able to tap into as a separate being.",The world as Self

aliens,"**Comet 4.**

Dear aliens,

I hope you’re still alive,

But if not, please come to my party!

&amp;#x200B;

**Comet 5.** So, I would like to make a landing party because I see a lot of aliens on this planet living in the clouds, and I thought that I should do something to help them get down to earth. And at this party, we we’ll just have some drinks, make some comets, fire some fireworks, and if the weather will be nice, we’ll also have some barbeque. Human speaking, we’ll just have a very normal, a very human party, nothing to worry about. So, if you’re an alien, and if you’re still alive, then join me, and let’s start landing! But if not, please read my comets! Wo!o!!ooo!

&amp;#x200B;

**The human Thought Experiment 2.** But before we land, let’s have a human thought experiment, human speaking, let’s just have a drink. So, let’s imagine that you’re a human and you’re sitting on a cloud, and you have your favourite drink. Now, let’s say that you get a little bit bored and you want to make a party but you know nobody so nobody wants to join you. So then, you decide to get down to earth, find some humans, maybe make some friends and then ask them to come to your party. But how do you talk to a human? How do you talk to someone that you’ve never talked before? And the most important thing, how do you get down to earth?

**The Landing Map 2.** Now, to help you out I’ve made for you a Landing Map. This little map will help you see through the clouds and will help you get down to earth. And to use this map, you just have to choose one of the options below that will help you hit the ground. And once you land, just send us a comet and tell us how you landed.

**1.** **The Comet Landing.** Now, probably the best and the easiest way to land, is to land on a comet. And that’s very easy to do, all you have to do is to make a comet and to send it to another planet. Just make sure that you land on land and not in the middle of the ocean, unless of course you really need a shower.

**2.** **The Crash Landing.** Basically, a crash landing is when you crash and then you look for your balls. Human speaking, you crash and then you look for your legs, your hands and for anything that’s left. Or how they say, you crash and then you worry. And for that you don’t really need big brains, you just need big balls. The only problem with this is that if you lose your balls, you might never find them. So, it’s up to you if you want to take this risk.

**3.** **The Emergency Landing.** The emergency landing is really your last resort. It’s for when you’re really desperate and you just don’t have a choice. So, you just fire the alarms, ring all the bells, and call for help. “Hey! I’m new here! I’m an alien! And this is my first landing! Please be gentle! Please be kind to me! Please don’t let me sink!” And this can work very well for you, and it might save you from a very bumpy ride. The only problem is that by calling for help, you’re also broadcasting your presence to every human on the planet, and the fact that you’re an alien. And if you want to land on a private land, then broadcasting your presence to the whole universe might not be a really good idea.

4. **The Red Carpet.** Now, probably the dream of any tourist, and any visitor alike, is to land on a red carpet. Because, let’s be honest, who doesn’t really like a good old carpet? The carpet can be very soft, very smooth, and it can provide you a very soft landing. The only problem is that you really have to hit the target, and if you miss the carpet, you might be for a very long and for a very bumpy ride. To translate to human this means being out of touch, having really big expectations, and just not being prepared for the worst. You’re just expecting that everyone is just waiting for you, and that all you have to do, is to reveal yourself to the world and let them know that you’re here. And then everyone will upvote you, shower you in compliments, take you to the front page, and welcome you to Earth. And maybe this is how it works on your cloudy planet, but that’s not really how it works on earth. So, if you have a bumpy ride and you start to lose control, then just drop your expectations, and just wait for nobody to upvote you. And if nobody will upvote you, then at least you won’t get disappointed.

**5.** **The Bumpy ride.** The bumpy ride is when you completely miss your target, and you lose control. And this happens when you’re so anxious and so worried about a perfect landing that you completely run of course. Human speaking, you crash your spaceship to the ground, and then you start panicking. And you panic so much that you start to lose your balls. And then you start to refresh the page every five seconds, biting your nails and waiting for someone to give you an upvote. And if nobody gives you an upvote, you start to panic even more, and then you delete everything and you try to land again. And you do this again and again until you lose your balls. But why, why do you have to crash, bite your nails, and lose your balls, when you can just leave a comet, go away and just have a very nice sleep, and then you can come back the next day to see where did your comets landed?

**6.** **The Lurking.** The lurking is basically a practice you can use when you’re too afraid to land. You basically go around in circles looking for a perfect place and time to land. The problem with this is that it can become a vicious circle. And then the more time you lurk in the dark, the harder is to find the light. And you can lurk in the dark for ages, and even get stuck forever. So, if you’re still lurking there and if you really want to break the circle and not to break your neck, then just land right now. The perfect time might never come, and you might never get a second chance.

**7.** **The Ship Landing.** Now, probably the worst mistake an alien can make is to mistake a sheep for a ship, and to try to land their ship on a sheep. Big mistake. And I just don’t understand the logic. How can you land a spaceship on a sheep and still not look like a sheep? And, I’m not even talking about the sheep. And maybe the logic behind is that if you land your ship on a lot of sheep, then the sheep should act like a buffer zone, and decrease the impact your ship will have when hitting the ground, and that might be just enough to save your sheep. But why, why do you have to fill your ship full of sheep and drive like a sheep? Why don’t you just land on a green land? Human speaking, why do you have to be a sheep trying to argue with every sheep, when you can just leave your comets in a green land, or on a land free of sheep? Just leave the sheep alone, and look for someone who can understand your language. And if nobody can understand you, then just talk to nobody.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comet 6.** Now of course, there’re many more ways to get down to earth, but for the moment, nobody really knows them. And if you know a better way, or a road that nobody knows, then shoot me a star, and I will update my map.

**Comet 7.** Now, I don’t really want to leave my clouds. But if I would be a human, and if I would have to get down to Earth, then I would try to land on an alien land. And then I would try to convince everyone that nobody can land on earth. I would even make a landing theory to prove that nobody is a human, so that I could convince everyone that there’s nobody on Earth. So, here is my Landing theory, please take a look, and if you like it, please give me an opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Theory 12. The Landing Theory.** So, the landing theory simply states that “nobody is a human, therefore nobody can land on Earth” But that’s just a theory, and a theory is not a theory unless you put it under test. And to test it, I will try land on Earth, and see what happens. So, wish me lack.

&amp;#x200B;

**BBQ 2. What is a comet?** A comet is a form of communication between different worlds, and is basically a way to send a message through the universe to someone from another planet. Human speaking, that’s just a little ball of dust and ice that nobody threw into the space, just to mess a little bit with some curious cats. Nothing really special. So, have you seen my comets? And if you did, do you like them? And if you like my comets, please send me a comet back, and tell me what you like. And if you want more comets, then just shoot me a star, and I will send you more comets.

**BBQ X. what is a BBQ?** BBQ is a codeword for the “Best Boring Questions”, or in short, a barbeque. So, how was my barbeque? Do you like it? And if you do, just send me a unicorn. But if not, then give your unicorns to nobody and nobody will be happy. And if you have a boring question, or a question that nobody can answer, then shoot me a star, or just leave me a comet, and I’ll make some barbeque for you. They say that nobody can change the world, and maybe they’re right, so let’s help nobody.

&amp;#x200B;

**Just 2 more things.** Now, if you’re still reading this, and if you still didn’t downvote me down, please downvote me now. Please don’t push me into space, please push me down. Human speaking, don’t push me to the front page of a very crowded crowd. I’m trying to hit the ground, not to land on a cloud. So, please downvote nobody, and tell nobody about my party. Also, if someone will try to downvote you, please tell them to downvote me too, and help me hit the ground.

Over the last few months I’ve taken a deep-dive into the UFO/UAP phenomena and have listened and learned a lot from people here, and people I’ve spoken to that are ex-military and others experience regarding their perspective and what they believe. However, a few days ago, I had one of the most  vivid dreams I’ve experienced in my entire life. To put this briefly, I dreamt that I was taken to a remote location (really don’t know where), and watched as a silent craft flew above me. This craft was a black craft with large Illuminating lights, and when I tried to get a clear view of it, my vision was somewhat distorted. Soon after, I happened to see a bunch of other crafts, smaller and similar to the shape of the Kumburgaz Turkey craft. Maybe this can easily be explained as a coincidence, but also maybe not. Lastly, before all of this happened, I witnessed a bright star move around in a way I couldn’t explain. I live in a northeast in an area with little light pollution, and I have not seen anything like that before in my entire life. Let me know your thoughts, if you have any.",Dream Experience

aliens,I think about our species a lot. We are complex intellectual beings capable of inter planetary travel. We can cure diseases and help other species of animals on our planet but here's where I feel things get kinda interesting cause we have done most of these things in only a couple hundred years. We are not even close to being an intellectual civilization on a cosmic scale. We are still babies on the level of a species and yet a few years ago we almost ended ourselves in the cold war. Here's when things get interesting our Galaxy has about a hundred billion planets alone. And out of those there are 40 billion planets in the habitable zone which means they are not too far and not too close to their star (the Goldilocks zone) and if we take it that out of those many potentially habitable planets only 0.1% had life which again is an assumption there would be 40 million planets with life on them and as our Galaxy is about 14 billion years old there is a very good chance that those planets have had potentially millions of years of advancement ahead of us. So where are they? Even if we take the Fermi paradox into consideration there should atleast be a type 2 civilization somewhere and if there is shouldn't we be able to detect it? I know this sounds childish to assume but if there was an advanced civilization would they even want anything to do with us? The very fact that we might never live long enough to see another species of another planet is honestly scary cause it kinda feels like a cosmic level of loneliness where all the other civilizations are almost ignoring us. Or maybe our methods of communication are too primitive for them to listen in to and just adding to that is the fact that we might be too small and insignificant for the other civilizations to detect us. It's scary but also exciting. Our lives may not be long enough to see them aliens but it's still fun to think about the probability of them existing.,The probability that we are alone are very little and the probability of advanced civilizations are actually really high

By dominated I mean that they control all outreach and development of various intelligent life forms. Also it is likely an AI hive mind which explains how they prevent any rogue actors.

aliens,"I had a dream about aliens last night; for some reason, I was sleeping outside in my dream under a canopy. I had an eye mask and my dog laying between my legs. All the sudden there was this red glow I could see from under my mask; I heard and felt the aliens breathing on my body as I laid there.... so I tried to lift my mask and I couldn't... I could just hear them chatter.

I tried to protect my dog, so with my sleep mask on I jumped at them yelling.

I finally was able to lift my mask once and get a good look at them; they were the grey aliens

Then they left

So I went into the house with my dog, upstairs into this room with a bunch of my ""friends""

I asked who else saw the aliens and everyone stood up in agreeance.

So we prepared for the next night because for some reason we knew they'd return

So we pulled down all the blinds, closed all the air vents in the room, etc.

At midnight the next night, they did return in their ship... I saw this white glow coming from the windows

And so I peeked outside... the house was being abducted/lifted from the ground and carried through the neighborhood!

I looked at the clock in the room it was midnight... but then time started going backwards.

I left through the back porch, (my house was in a few acres of woods) already freaked out I ran around the house to get the the front where my trampoline was.  As I turned the corner I could see a bright light. When I got closer in full view it looked like a human shape, like arms and limbs and head, and much taller but bright and fuzzy. The light was comforting.  I felt calm even though it should have scared me.  Then it left I can’t remember how, if it went up or disappeared it’s weird I can’t remember that part.  But I made my way to my trampoline and slept.  I always thought it was an angel calming me when I was scared.

I know pretty much all there is to find about the footage, from the supposed ""real frames"" insertion to the Dec and ant movie comedy.

I find the whole hoax story less believable than the original story being real: they made the body with animal parts , organs, silicone and whatnot. And they even told hold difficult it was to get rid of the body, in several dumpster all over England.... Really? You dispose of a fake body like a ""real body""? Who does that? ( I supposed so no one will suspect any potential hoax?) If you work on SFX, you know what to do with left over props right? 

And the quality and detail of the fake alien body is some of the best I've seen. Even X-files or any other Hollywood budget SFX autopsy, they look fake at first glance. This one is really something else.

 That level of realism just to sell it for like $25k to TV? 

And the special effect technical side of it is kind of huge to. The wet on wet is really tricky, even in blockbusters. So they must have had dudes under the table or off camera pumping blood out from inside. 

The skin of the face shift and move as the guys cut him up. I'm not sure how silicone or latex move and stay in place when you manipulate it, or maybe it's mortifican wax?

If we live productive and good lives we can “move-on” to a better existence in the stars. If not we are then doomed to another life on this planet (I think).

Anyways, humanity and souls have forgotten their true purpose in life and were very restless by praising different deity’s. So the aliens sent a half human half alien to earth to get us to the day where we can invent stuff that would help each other.

We did, and now we all are restless again. I don’t think they’d send something to guide us again. Jesus served his purpose. I don’t wanna get all biblical on you, for I just think the Bible was a guide for times before the printing press was invented. Because we need to heed the golden rule. That’s it, nowadays.

aliens,,The Mystery And Secrets Of Ark Of The Covenant
aliens,"Hi everyone. Just to give you some background I was always a skeptic, ever since I did some research about UFOs. To be clear I was 100% sure there was life in many other place in the universe I just believed that we are all bound to the limits of the speed of light and thus we would never have been able to make contact with anything outside of our own solar system. To get to the point I recently came across Joe Rogan's podcast with the general that was involved with the tictac incident. 



This episode shocked me. For the first time I came across a case that I knew was 100%, 100000% real. Evidence that was backed by the US Navy and the Pentagon, and there was such a credible and qualified witness. It's amazing. And really I didn't care much for the possibility of aliens, although it is also exciting. I was so moved by this testimony because, to me, it serves as proof that there somehow exists a craft that moves by bending time space and thus is not confined to the speed of light. It honestly changed everything for me, I was 100% certain that such technology is possible only theoretically, that finding a sufficient energy source would never be possible. But there it was, caught on tape, by the Navy, on two seperate occasions. (Gimbel &amp; TicTac)



So of course that podcast led me to the one with Bob Lazar. Let me tell you this one is messing with my brain. On the one hand what he's saying sounds like total conspiracy mumbo jumbo. Like the classic stuff. Ufo at area 51, archeological findings, blah blah blah. But his story stayed so consistent over 30 years, it's amazing. He also talks so genuinely I can actually feel his experience. But then on the other hand there are no signs for his education in the places that he claimed he studied at. And I don't believe the government went to each house of every of his classmates and asked them to tear out a the page with him on it from their yearbook. But to contradict that again, he doesn't seem like an average guy, not just another joe that read about some advanced physics top 10 facts and started trying to imitate himself as an expert. In anyway I still haven't decided what I think about his story but I think it's important to dissect it and analyze it as thoroughly as possible. 



**This is where the main point of my post starts**
One of the most often used points by skeptics is element 115. Back in the 90s in that instructional video Bob released he talked about how the propulsion system he worked with was based on a stable isotope of element 115 and there protons that were launched into it, to momentarily create element 116 that was highly unstable and thus would evaporate and release anti-matter. Of course back then element 115 was yet to be synthesized, but then in 2003 it was. And it turned to be that it and all of its isotopes are extremely radioactive and unstable. Their life-time being less than half of a second. 


So any way here is my possible explanation for that. Back in the tape that he released in the 90s([link](https://youtu.be/C9_8DJY5UyY) ) He says the following thing (I'm paraphrasing) he does indeed say that the higher the atomic number of the element is the less stable he becomes, but he says that around 114-115 protons the elements should be more stable. And that 116 should be again very unstable and radioactive. Well if you look at chemistry that is actually a known concept, while still being hypothetical! It is called the [island of stability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability#:~:text=In%20nuclear%20physics%2C%20the%20island,and%20long-lived%20primordial%20radionuclides.) And it basically predicts that as the amount of protons in an atom (which decides its atomic place) rises the element indeed becomes unstable. Infact after 105 protons it becomes nearly impossible finding isotoped that are stable for more than a day, **but** it says that further down the line, there is a small clump of atomic orders, that if matched by the correct number of protons could create an isotope that would be very stable (several years of lifetime). And around what atomic order is this clump located? That's right, the island of stability is located at around 110-115 in the atomic order. And here's the thing element 114 has been synthesized! And it is much more stable than 115. It was proven to theoretically be able to remain stable for more than a year! So basically all this comes down to a very basic theory: Bob Lazar made an educated guess regarding the exact atomic order of the element. He was off by one proton. The element in the engine was 114!! And when met with a proton it turned into 115 (instead of 116) and became highly usntable. The principle is exactly the same! But it matches up perfectly if we reduce the amount of protons.",What if Bob Lazar mistook element 115 and 114?

aliens,"Ok, so here is my theory about the ufo/alien phenomena. This is not really thought through that much to be honest.  I came up with it tonight.  My native language is not English so I apologize for any weird sentencing or words. I am very interested in the subject about ufo’s/aliens. For the last 5 years or so I have been having a daily routine of looking up interesting topics and searching the internet for any interesting ufo stories, interviews, videos etc. I’ve been watching everything from fake shit to made up stories to videos that seems really credible like the David Fravor interviews, Bob Lazar, Utah ufo etc. However, you get pretty good after a while at sorting out the “fake shit” that is greatly over-represented on the internet, IMO. 

A big percent of ufo videos we watch could be explained to be a balloon, bird, natural phenomena etc. A lot of stories are made up of course. We never have any 100% evidence of alien existence. My personal belief is that alien life exists but the distances between intelligent life forms could be astronomical and it’s possible we will never encounter other life forms than the ones that forms at earth. 

THE THEORY

So far you have no idea what my theory is, I will tell you now. Some point in time a “group” with incredible access of information and perhaps money was started, a group that includes brilliant minds that understand our place in the universe and that also understands what humanity needs to be to survive. A group that could have been started by maybe one or several ""famous"" people or persons with ""power"" that other people with equal.. lets call it mindset,  would look up to. I call it a group because I don’t really know what else to call it. A group that looked at our earth and humanity and reckoned that we will never be a space-faring species that can survive for example a supernova unless we are united as “one” and don’t rely on one single place we call home. We need to look to the stars if we want our species to survive.

The earth can't be like it is today, continents like AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA and so on need to be one. We simply need to be one species. Why? The answer Is obvious. We will always have our wars on our earth as long as the economy controls.

The actual theory

You’ve heard fake alien invasion before? Yeah, me too. For whatever the reason the fake alien invasion case is being made I have another theory. My theory is that the fake alien invasion might happen and that will be what unites the human species to become a spacefaring species. Not a fake alien invasion to control the people of the earth in some way but the opposite, a fake invasion that will happen because we need to stop wars and fighting over this planet. A uniting of the human race to look to the stars instead of trying to conquering and controlling this planet. A fake invasion for the greater good of the human race. A fake invasion that is being orchestrated to save our species.",Fake alien invasion?

aliens," just can't believe that they aren't connected. I mean lets look at the core facts

Interest in gravity propulsion and manipulation intensified in the early 1950's - just a few years after the alleged crash in Roswell in '47.

Bob Lazar claimed the Navy was behind his employment at S-4 in Broom Lake - reverse engineering advanced gravity propulsion systems 

The Navy was behind the videos that the Pentagon verified, chasing crafts that likely fly using Anti-gravity (no wings, or heat source or obvious systems of creating lift or propulsion) some of which were filmed in 2014, the Navy has a long history of encounters and experiences with such crafts. 

The Navy as of 2016 has a patent for Anti-gravity craft and propulsion systems, that work in a similar way to those lazar described many years a go.

I am open minded, and I know a lot of people question Lazar's authenticity - and I am aware that having a patent doesn't necessarily mean they have the tech, but surely there are too many coincidences for it to be completely false? 

I think they have successfully reverse engineered the tech over many decades. Why file four patents if you have no way, means or prospect of having that technology?

aliens,"I live on Lake Michigan and my dad used to see these kinds of lights over it all the time when he was younger.

When i was 6 or 7 i saw 2 red lights in the night sky. I thought it was a helicopter hovering there until they both started like a u turn motion and revolving around eachother like that then spinning and sped off like that.

Well just now i saw a light in the night sky, and it was a very artificial color. I've never seen it before and its not possible to make with our color wheel. It was almost a pink, green, orange and like a light purple color i guess mixed into one but with our color wheel that would make brown but this light was super vibrant and you could see all the colors at the same time basically. Then it sped to a point and stopped and the light went out then about 3 seconds later the light was back and it sped to a new place. Then it went out again and 3 seconds later it was back and sped down towards the ice on the lake and it stopped like maybe 20 ish feet above the ice and dissapeard. Then i heard what sounded like someone walking in crunchy snow echoing off the lake and it wasn't heavy enough to break the ice but it was heavy enough to make noise and it was coming straight for me. The light that was behind me wasn't bright enough to block out the stars, which just meant it wasn't bright enough to light up whatever was walking towards me. I saw a shadow humanoid silhouette kind of thing and ran straight into the house to write this. Now the last time anyone saw lights over lake michigan was in the 60s.

They weren't solid but they were in the shape of the classic grey aliens. Naturally my aquantince became kind of anxious and overwhelmed, the aliens noticed this and reached their hands out to touch his head. It was an instant calming effect, almost felt like a small ego death.  While they were doing this they seemed to have telepathically sent a message. It was very clearly the words "" You're standing in front of yourself."" Super bizarre experience and not what my friend expected at all. 

But it felt reallyyy good. The feeling of the aliens touching and relieving the anxiety felt comparable to a pain pill or  something .

Maybe a month or so later my same friend decided to take acid and trip along with another friend.  (Found out later it was fake acid so that could have something to do with the vividness of the following visuals?? Not sure). 

During the trip he and his friend watched Apocalypse Now, And the acid turned out to be fake, so it was a pretty fucking weird night. Nothing too crazy for acid though. 

 However, the next morning my friend was the only person awake and he had come down almost entirely. His other friend was sleeping on the couch across from him and so he was left to watch tv by himself. He decided since he had already pretty much come down entirely off the acid that he would take a baby hit of the DMT pen and see what happens.

At first it seemed to do nothing, but my friend noticed a tiny movement in the fabric of the pillow that was closest to him. He picked it up to closer examine it. Upon closer inspection he noticed tiny numbers running across the strands of the fabric. It was barely noticeable unless he had brought his eyes closer to it.

In his head he thought, "" Holy shit this is like the matrix."" 

his next thought was , ""it's okay , show me the matrix""

It seemed to almost respond his thoughts and within seconds the entire room in front of him was coated in the moving green numbers. There was still dimension to everything but the whole field of vision was black and green numbers. Then slowly the volume of everything around him dissolved. It felt almost like he had gone blind except for the black and green numbers all around him.

Instantly he remembered that he would need to see in order to drive to work later that day so this was a really bad problem. He freaked out, and as the anxiety grew the numbers almost got sucked out of the room. Everything seemed back to normal.

He then heard a rumbling outside. He was laying on a couch directly next to a window so he could see the whole neighborhood. It sounded like there was a earthquake. 

He noticed a bubble started to form around him. It was so bizarre. It was iridescent like a regular bubble, but it was made up of interlocking flower of life patterns.  There were interlocking shimmering rainbow circles that formed a sphere bubble around my friend. 

He then noticed that the world outside of the bubble began to crumble, and the rumbling noise grew louder and all the houses he could see outside started to break down as if the san andreas fault had  broken.

Then the bubble popped and again my friend was in the room with his friend sleeping across from him on the opposite couch. 

The ceiling began to shift above him.  I shit you not, a 50 foot tall grey alien had lifted off the ceiling with it's hand. Like a dollhouse.  My friend was staring up at this perfectly vivid grey alien the size of a building above him. No fractals, completely solid and looking exactly like a hollywood movie. Nothing like my friend had ever experienced from any psychedelic. (EXACTLY LIKE THIS -&gt;👽)

There was an even bigger grey cement ceiling above the alien. As if my friends house had been a dollhouse inside an enormous cement facility. There were even industrial lights that were the size of houses. 

Like the first time, the aliens didn't use verbal language. It seemed to telepathically relay a a mesage to my friend again.

This time though, it shifted my friends perspective so that he was sat in a playhouse auditorium. He was looking at himself and his friend in their house , but their house was a stage. The alien seemed to be telling him that his world was a stage.  The auditorium had red velvet seats, and it was incredibly detailed! Then the alien shifted him back into his own body and he was sat on the couch again.

This is pretty much where the experience ends. After this though, my friend experienced a couple months of SOMETHING. Not sure if it was drug induced psychosis, HPPD, or a mix of both, but mentally his world was rocked for a couple months. Thankfully he  bounced back and is on his two feet. But for a minute there visually the world looked a bit like a Dr. Suess world. Colors were brighter, trees seemed to be almost made of rubber how perfect they were. It was also hard to keep control of his emotions and it made him socially inept for a period of time.  Moral of the story, DONT DO DRUGS. especially fake ones.

How ever, his experience with DMT has made me really curious about what were dealing with! I Know very well it could have been just the power of the human brain and hard drugs, but I always wonder if those aliens were something else.

I’m wondering if Aliens don’t have that same problem of racism and if the slight variations in descriptions regarding types of Aliens is a reflection of different “races” or sub-types of their species.  

For example greys may be described as having  big noses, no noses, no ears/small ears, different heights or uniforms, saurians may or may not have snouts and/or an evil disposition, insectoids are described as being different colors, etc. ) 

I’m wondering because I would definitely feel more comfortable with any alien that has a human like appearance regardless of their skin color while anything that doesn’t resemble something found on earth would cause revulsion,  and anything with fangs or that appears like a threat will probably trigger a natural flight or fight response.",[Shower Thought] Do aliens have different races on their worlds like we do?

I think there is definitely more known about the UFO phenomenon by governments and I feel like we are slowly getting to disclosure.

1. Bob lazar is being proved to be correct about the governments study of UFO tech + his past experience at S4.

However, there are two UFO themed shows that I absolutely loved so I really thought I'd recommend them here:

[**UFO Witness:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0rO67DrBe4)  This show is actually very similar to Unidentified, even if it is a little overly dramatized at times.  The host is great, a former Federal agent and the series started out good and it started to get a little crazier with each episodes, but I was really shocked to see the very end episode, which I don't want to spoil.  Any longtime UFO fan absolutely has to see the finale, because it's really interesting.

[**Aliens in Alaska:**]  I thought this was going to be an even speculative UFO show than Ancient Aliens but actually it was far more interesting than that.  There are times when it gets a little ridiculous but for the most part this is some of the best UFO content I've seen in mainstream media.  There are tons of different sightings with a lot of actual recently taken photo evidence to analyze so if you're bored of hearing the same stories over and over, this is the show for you.  I'm not finished with the whole show yet but I really have to recommend it.  Honestly, this show is almost better than UFO Witness simply because the information and sightings are a lot more recent and the pace is a lot faster.  Nothing is absolutely mind blowing and only a few of the pictures are really mind blowing but there is a lot of good stuff here to watch.  Also the videos and pictures taken are within the past few years so that's a refreshing sight.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the last few episodes of this one.

(April 7th, 11:00pm)


I had gone out on the 6th of April to see if anything was going to happen; nothing did; plus it wasn't a clear night anyway, so I went inside and hopped in bed.

Fast forward to the 7th of April; the evening of which I was fortunate to witness more anomalies. I built a fire in the old wheel rim; and laid out a cot beside the soothing flames. This night, unlike the night of the 6th was super clear; I could see all the stars above. Every so often my view was obstructed by a passing plume of cloud.

Anyway let's get straight to the good shit...

I didn't get flashed last night like I had on the 5th. Instead the first noticable UFO activity was one of those ""Stealth Observers"" I've already described. 

I saw a lone star, slightly brighter than the rest, blinking at irregular intervals, the blinking almost imperceivable. 

Keep in mind I hadn't even needed to practice CE5 for this to happen. I literally just sat out there with the intention to star-gaze. 

The Observer as if in response to my skepticism trying to rationalize the shining dot as a satellite or drone; vanished into thin air. When it dissapeared it looked like it was shrinking to a smaller pin-point; until it had vanished 100%. 

My jaw dropped into my lap. 

Then the Observer appeared in a completely different part of the sky; an impossible distance for any man-made object to traverse in the mere blink of an eye.

Then something even crazier happened. I said the following in my mind, directed at the mysterious ball of light:

""What the hell are you guys doing? Flaunting your superior technology to try and impress me?""

Upon saying this in my head I was met with an immediate wave of the most bizarre sensation I have ever felt. It was like I had been knocked out, and brought back to lucidity in the matter of a second's fraction. My ears were ringing with great intensity, as if I'd been punched in the face. 

Now this next part could probably land my in an insane asylum, but here goes...

I heard a trumpet sound. It was very quick, It didn't seem tied to any point in my surroundings. Just a quick burst of trumpet, almost like a war trumpet from the movies. This sound made my heart beat something fierce.

I went inside shortly after.

That pretty much encapsulates the events of last night. I told my father about it this afternoon and he is willing to star-gaze with me this coming Friday; 
l just hope it's a clear night. I hope he sees what I'm seeing; because if it just so happens that this is all in my head, that would indicate that I'm mentally unstable.

Cheers Sincerely, Cythil",🤯I didn't even use CE5 this time around👽

A lot of abduction cases mention cancer curing through energy and that can be a starting point. The qigong I discuss is the barrier between us and the subconcious. It is automatically happening to all of us, straying from our natural qigong causes ailments. This is hard science, the religious aspect is   in terms of aliens in this context. 
I am not the first to realize qigong is science, and cure my ailments mixing the two Liu Guizhen did it in China as well in the 1950s. Mainly, qigong should be the form of the American government, but any government really.

I am afraid the qigong would get a lot of other crooked doctors in even more trouble, based on what it looks like the aliens are trying to communicate in encrypted stories of medical abuse aboard spaceships. That is one of the main reasons qigong should be integrated. The truth is hard to swallow, but so is medical malpractice. Plenty of doctors have written qigong books already. 

In short, the qigong would help us come to terms with the justice level necessary for such advanced beings to feel their offspring would be 100% safe if the alien/humans were to successfully integrate. 

That means any given problem needs to be tended to, Detroit being one of them. 

Integrating the law so we are all on the same page helps as well.
The main goal is to follow these basic foundations to find if there is an increase in alien abduction/ufo sighting frequency with heavier evidence.

But we have allowed our desires to turn a different direction where we are destroying ourselves and our environment. And continuing on our current path will lead us to doom. (Very biblical to me, but that I’d for another discussion.)

But as far as I hear, the story ends there. And maybe I’ve not pursued it further or paid attention. But have extraterrestrials shared what happens to us if we die along that path?  Is there a soul?

aliens,"One of the main questions I personally have when it comes to alien interest in planet earth is one of the 5 W’s: why. 
I think most believers have come to a consensus that it has to do with our ability to split the atom. Nuclear warfare is inherently bad, &amp; impacts the universe far more than we realize. That’s why there’s so much activity around military bases &amp; nuclear zones. 
(Also, if we reference the Ariel School event, what the greys communicated to the children had to mainly do with preserving our planet &amp; our nature. Obviously nuclear warfare is in direct conflict with that ideology.)
Which leads me to my main point: if you’ve been reading the news, the amount of possible nuclear threat is on the rise: Russia, China, Taiwan, North Korea - to name a few.
The whole world is on edge right now. I think we’ve been in a Cold War without even realizing it. Tensions are high, warfare is on the horizon, &amp; we are capable of completely wiping everything out.

aliens,"(By ""native fidelity"", I mean our own eyes)

In thinking on the noted absurdities of the phenomenon, I wonder if the crafts' appearances are not a part of that equation.

We seem to have some sense that convincing footage would look ""real"" -- that immediately we would be able to draw level-headed comparisons between them and our own technology -- yet I wonder how true that would be. Is it not possible, rather, that the appearance of a craft, were we to see it up close and in high detail, look *uncanny*? Might it, in fact, look more *unreal* than *real*?

This came to my mind especially while reviewing supposed contactee Billy Meier's photographs of what he claims to be UFOs. I am not taking a stance here regarding the truth/untruth of what Meier has claimed or the authenticity/inauthenticity of the photos, but it is *interesting* that the photos seem to largely have been casually dismissed on the basis of them looking ""obviously like models.""

There is some story that's been passed around for a while now that when a certain group of native people saw the ships of foreigners on the water, the sight was so outside of their realm of normalcy or mundanity that they did not cognitively register the sight. It seems that there's very little supportive evidence for this story -- at least for its drawn conclusion --, and I don't know how it gained traction. Perhaps people couldn't believe that an indigenous tribe wouldn't militarily mobilize at the sight, and interpreted inaction as ""blindness."" I mention it because I wonder if we can reorient its narrative to suggest the possibility that, even if most people today live among some level of ""high-tech"" development and are aware of inventions like airplanes, there still may be such a gap between our points of reference and UAP craft that, were we to see one up close, it might be something like people in 18th-century Germany witnessing our sleekest and most modern self-driving car.

Moreover, I think we should consider that, for some decades now, *we have pre-viewed UFOs in the context of shows and movies where they are CGI models*. In this sense, *we have been primed to view and understand a phenomenon largely through the context of fiction*. Were that fiction to become real, and were it to be rendered unambiguously, I think it would create a highly surreal impression.

aliens,"Take the Sentinelese tribe that murders the shit out of anyone or anything that comes near them. Let’s say something they’re doing is going to cause their extinction or affect the whole world negatively.
    We can’t physically go near them without spreading disease that they have no immunity to. They can’t read or speak our languages. We’ve flown drones over them and they throw spears at them. Basically defending themselves against a UAP they see as a threat. 
    Attempts at contact using technology would come across as paranormal to them or otherworldly. Boats and ships have crashed on the island and introduced metal which they used for creating weapons; sounds like a familiar story. 
    Let’s say a tsunami was coming that was going to wipe them out. Or something they created was eventually going to wipe all of us out. How would we tell them?

aliens,"I'm sure most of us are aware that DMT is highly potent psychedelic, that when taken in sufficient quantities can lead to experiences where the subject in question will meet what appears to be other beings. that is, intelligent forms of life that interact with the subject, and in many cases appears somewhat surprised to see them. 

It's common to have these experiences written off as mere hallucinations, in other words, fake. however I'm not entirely convinced of this. 

If you take the materialist view, that is that we are purely the result of a capricious and semi-random process called evolution by natural selection, then the way we perceive reality is also a result of that process. In other words, there is nothing ""true"" or ""certain"" about the way we see the world around us, everything we perceive is a result of that process. so then how can we say confidently, that a substance that alters the way our brain functions, and the way we perceive reality, produces things that are not ""real?"" There is no higher truth to the way we perceive reality in daily life, how can we say that when our brain function is altered, we are no longer seeing ""reality?"" It seems to me that there is nothing to elevate one state of brain function over the other, as neither are the result of some higher ordering. 

from the religious perspective, it's somewhat arrogant to say that the way our brains are wired allow us to perceive all of gods creation all the time. We could not see microbes before the microscope, and perhaps we cannot see this other space, without DMT. 

Basically, I see no reason to think that these entities that people meet are not real, aside from cultural bias. In shamanistic traditions, and in early pagan traditions, the use of psychedelics was seen as a way to attain knowledge, to meet the unknown, and to expand understanding. Perhaps there was something to that. The people who experience it certainly say that it ""feels more real"" than their daily life.","DMT and the ""Entities"""

aliens,"I have a few theories really, but one sticks steadfast in my mind and makes the most sense to me.

I believe they, extraterrestrial species, are frequently visiting the earth, if not semi/permanently based here as well, to closely observe our advancements in technology as to ensure the safety of their own and other species outside of earth.

I ""feel"" as if they are willing to entertain the option of guiding our species forward technologically, provided we evolve mentally and morally to their satisfaction. 

The obvious benefit to being close to earth with a UFO fleet (military) buildup is the ability to preemptively swat us back down to earth if deemed necessary to prevent any dangerous, toxic, or hostile growth outside of our domain into the vastly populated universe.

I also believe that when we nuked Japan, not only did the giant radioactive wave signal out throughout the universe, but the electromagnetic remnants of human and animal souls all leaving carbon matter at the same time must've been a horrific signal to receive, if not a dire warning.

What I’ve thought recently on is a common theme between religions. Do the best you can be and reap the rewards in the afterlife. But my question is, does this theme continue today?

Let’s think about it, aliens have been involved with the development of humanity, probably in all aspects. One day it came to me, what if aliens have made a galactic of currency for themselves? 

It’s interesting to think of us like this, but for the moment let’s say it is. The situation would be like this: An aspiring E.T. wants to be a wealthy individual amongst his equals and goes to a company to enter some kind of stasis machine. His consciousness is abruptly ported into the soul of a new born human baby. That alien plays the role of a human in a primitive world that promotes freedom and free will. The human prides itself on diversity, choices and temptations, a common idea between big religions.

So when the human dies, they abruptly wake up in their pod with their established credit score in view. Have a low score? Get reincarnated. 

This means that advanced E.T.s could be cultivating humans for the sake of currency. What is 90 years of human life compared to an alien who can live for thousands?

aliens,"I constantly see people in the UFO or Alien communities always say that Aliens don't contact us because we are too stupid, evil, or don't take care of the planet. This narrative is highly supported on this particular sub too.

So my question is. Why would Aliens give a dam about humans in the first place? Lol. What do humans not taking care of their own planet gotta do with them again? 🤔. Why do care about the well-being of humans or the politics of humans?  What Aliens gain from worrying about how humans feel.

You can bring the ant analogy. But there is a big difference between being curious about a species from criticizing the whole species mindset or the way they go about things. This almost sounds like it's just humans projecting their normal anti-human misanthropic views about humans on Aliens they have never meant. Hmmm 🤔. Lol. 

Some people say Aliens are here to help humanity reach spiritual enlightenment. All this makes Aliens look like some heroic Gods coming to save us from ourselves or something. Again my question is. Why would they care?  Humanity can go away. The earth can go away. And it will not affect the lives of Aliens. So why would they care about a planet that has nothing to do with them. Why would Aliens care if humans kill each other or don't kill each other? The point is what we do here on earth does not affect them at all. Because that's none of their business since they are light years away lol.

Realistic Aliens would have better things to do with their defining the laws of physics technology. Instead of worrying about HUMAN-BASED ISSUES 🗣. Last time I check only humans care about global warming, animals, the health of Earth, or our souls. It's kind of strange Aliens would care about human concepts that have nothing to do with them? Human beings don't even give a dam about what happens in other countries lol.

My take on this: I know more women get abducted then men and usually get a baby, need to take care or learn hybrid aliens things like a mother would, learn a child, seeing a large head, black eyes.   
Can't they be related to a mother that would think of these things? Dreaming about a small humanoid fetus with black eyes and large head and remembers it as an alien.

I clicked the link out of curiosity and of course, the highest membership level is the only one without recorded meetings and it's $49 a month. Granted, $49 a month isn't the steepest price for subscriptions, but it feels awfully close to a Scientology scheme????? Pay to get closer to the top dog, working your way up the ladder. I know there's plenty of people who think he's a nut job but I want to hear from those of you that have been following his work, are you starting to get turned off to the cult-like pyramid that's starting too? He already had the CE5 weekend sessions you could pay for which included lodging and meals so I understood why those costed money.. but this??? I thought he was desperate to spread awareness, so why is there a pay-to-get-more system now?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to see a Magnetic anomaly map on Google Earth:

[https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/emag2.html](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/emag2.html)

[https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/data/EMAG2/UpCont\_shade\_KMZ.kmz](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/data/EMAG2/UpCont_shade_KMZ.kmz)

I did see some highly magnetic spots near the points of interest.  However, the resolution is 2 arc seconds which is about 200 square feet or 60 square meters.  That is part of the problem, the other part is that near the poles the coordinate systems are usually garbage.  This just means that the people that create these maps are more interested in making sure the spatial integrity is good for places we live and where everyone would like to look.  This means that all the distortion gets routed to the poles.  So, I this 200 feet for accuracy is being kind at the poles.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a link to get the gravity data for Google Earth:

[https://topex.ucsd.edu/grav\_outreach/files/global\_grav.kmz](https://topex.ucsd.edu/grav_outreach/files/global_grav.kmz)

I did not see anything outrageous for this.  In the Bob Lazar stuff, he talks about elements high on the periodic table.  They would show up on this map as very high density.  The problem would be that these points of interest are right in the middle of the gradient for density.  A conspiracy theorist may say large caverns and heavy elements may just land us in the middle of the spectrum on density.  Gravity mapping is funny.  The closer to the surface, the more apparent it will be.  The deeper the gravity anomaly, the more likely the anomaly will appear to be smoothed out on the readings.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - There is nothing much to say about the available data.  I would like to go there and see for myself. I submitted quotes to

aliens,"I'm interested in which abduction accounts involve the abductee fighting with their abductor(s). This strikes me as a very rare part of the stories, since abductees tend to feel like they've lost bodily autonomy and/or are tranquilized by some unclear means.

The only self-described abductee whose story has included this which I'm aware of is Travis Walton who ""*awoke in a hospital-like room, being observed by three* *short, bald creatures**. He claimed that he fought with them until a human wearing a helmet led Walton to another room, where he blacked out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his face*."" I've heard more of Walton's story, but I forget the particulars of his fight, and can't remember how the creatures responded.

This interests me especially in the case of the Greys, who seem to have a mechanistic quality to their actions and thinking, and in certain cases (like Betty Andreasson Luca's) appear to express confusion over why humans are so upset or bothered by their being abducted and medically examined -- as if, if the abductee could just be ""rational"" about the need for their sperm or ova to be extracted, then they wouldn't make such a big fuss. There is a suggestion of an intellect which lacks an empathetic capacity and is unprepared to reckon with fear or anger, and so enforces submission and ""Good Vibes.""",Abduction accounts involving violent resistance?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that it's possible that humans may have been abducted by alien life forms or simply been offerred a chance covertly to leave earth and live on some other planet as well. And that many such people may have accepted the offer over the course of human history on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, another thing i feel is that some group of humans may have created ''advanced crafts'' that could have the possibility of reaching other solar systems within their life span.

&amp;#x200B;

 So they may have setup base or may have even negotiated with some friendly species to allow them to have their own region in the planet being controlled by that alien species.

# preface

Below are my notes on ET anatomical diversity.

Anatomy is one of the aspects of witness testimony I track closely in order to evaluate witness credibility.  I have encountered significant difficulties in doing so, because ET phenotypes often did not conform to naive expectations of evolutionary biology or nondualistic materialism.  The concepts below resolve many inconsistencies.

Having a conceptual framework for interpreting sensory data can reduce the fear generated by close encounters.  With that said, these notes are written primarily for myself, and are presented as-is.

# body

Chimerical variations of Graykin and Reptoid genuses cannot be used to discredit witness testimony due to the penchant of both for sapient hybridization.  Even absurdities such as literal nagas may be maintained as minority species for complex religious and sociocultural reasons.

The ubiquity of psychic powers including telekinesis (high dexterity, low power) renders even assumptions about the necessity of opposable thumbs untenable.  One cannot a hand anatomy will be optimized for flint-knapping.  One cannot even assume the presence of hands.

Human perception and memory of ET phenotype is particularly vulnerable to interference.  Psychic mimicry is very difficult to reinvoke once pierced.  Holographic mimicry is imperfect and unconvincing except when stationary.  Memory editing and deletion can often be reversed via hypnotic regression, but it is an unreliable process.  Autopsies are the gold standard.

Benevolent ET species tend to be racially unified and egalitarian.  Hostile species are also racially unified.  However, they may exhibit significant stratification in the form of hybrid sub-species, castes, and sub-entities.  A sub-entity lacks an astral body.  It may be a clone containing a ghost (a paranormal echo of an astral body),  or an android.

ETs optimize racial diversity into one cohesive species, but value subspecies as separate existences, with hostile ETs showing a greater propensity for sub-speciation.  Hostile ET societies exhibit both greater inequality and authoritarian conformity.

Some evidence suggests that arranged reincarnation of adult spirits into an embryo of a sapient species either naturally or via bioengineering influences the phenotype of the mature adult.  This may explain chimerical oddities which seem too minor and rare to be the result of hybrid sub-speciation.  Such adaptations likely improve the synchronization between spirit and foreign flesh.

Manifested astral bodies are another potential explanation for odd phenotypes, particularly when coupled with super speed and native dimensional shifting.  Such bodies generally lack density and otherwise behave somewhat like paranormal entities when manifested physically.  Presumably they are vulnerable to physical weaponry in that state, but would not remain in the material plane if incapacitated.  Heavy footprints can rule out an astral manifestation.",Using ET anatomical detail to evaluate witness credibility

aliens,"The two theories on skinwalker ranch that I believe address the most facts:	

1.	Skinwalker ranch is the location of an important ancient piece of technology that is protected by a sophisticated security measure that utilizes some form of (likely) automated technology to project fear into the minds of any conscious observers that get too close, thus warding people away. This technology is primarily intended to project fear into a conscious witness, utilizing both physical and non-physical manifestations that interact with the consciousness of the witness to project a personalized encounter. 

2.	Non-local incorporeal “lifeform” whose primary nourishment is a type of energy emitted by biological lifeforms during states of fear, aka Jinn. Such an entity (if it exists) would likely be composed of energy rather than matter. If we consider the law of conservation of energy which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another, we can see that such a lifeform would still require nourishment. Since a being of pure energy cannot convert bio-matter into energy, this energy must come from somewhere else. It’s entirely possible fear produces such energy in its most potent form. This potentially explains the hitchhiker effect, whereby people are allegedly followed home by whatever it is that they encountered on skinwalker ranch, experiencing similar paranormal activity in their home. The events that occur at home follow the same theme. The encounters are designed to instill fear.  

So far, I am more leaning towards the first theory. 

Watch this video for a good synopsis of the theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U9vfEbLLMA

The video above touches on the most convincing theory I’ve ever heard about skinwalker ranch and other paranormal hotspots around the world. Skip to 15 mins when he starts talking about stories from the NIDSci team. 

Basically, when you hear enough of these stories, you start to notice there is a single common thread tying them all together. What you notice is that every single encounter seems to be designed to instill fear into the witness/observer. These encounters are never positive. They are always negative. Which naturally raises the question of why. Why is fear the common thread tying together all these encounters? Why doesn’t the intelligence behind the phenomenon just kill people, instead choosing to scare them with strange antics? I find it hard to believe something truly intelligent (NIDSci categorized the phenomenon as “a precognitive sentient intelligence”) would waste time on absurd antics that are not so different from the exploits of your average internet troll. 

Intelligence does not act randomly. No, I think something very strange but ultimately purposeful is happening here. Think about it. The only reason you would want to scare something away is if you are trying to deter that thing from whatever it is you wish to remain hidden. What if some ancient long-extinct (or maybe not?) civilization had something they wanted to keep hidden. A base of operation; or even a piece of technology that cannot be risked ending up in the hands of our juvenile species. Either way, something clearly wants to keep people away from these locations. Given this, one would expect security measures designed to deter anyone or anything that gets too close. That’s the crux of this theory. Skinwalker ranch and other anomalous zones are alien security zones for an ancient (possibly non-human) civilization. All these strange paranormal manifestations are actually the product of this technology whose primary purpose is to ward off conscious beings by instilling fear and confusion.
	
When you consider this theory, all the absurdity of these paranormal encounters starts to make sense. Some believe all the creatures people report seeing are coming from different dimensions and these places are so-called “thin-spots” where the boundaries between our realities somehow interact. That makes sense until you really start to think about the behavior of these creatures, the consistent absurdity, and the commonalities between all these encounters. 

Why is it that whenever these frightening encounters occur, people are almost never actually physically harmed? Whenever there’s an encounter with one of these creatures, it almost always plays out the same way. 

-	The person sees something anomalous, usually a creature/being, orbs of light, ufos, apparitions, etc. 

-	The witness is almost always at the right place at just the right time to observe the anomalous event. Even when seemingly aware of observation, no attempt at concealment is made by the entities in question. They behave almost as if they want to be seen. 
-	Witnesses are then overcome with a sense of fear/dread that often feels unnatural, almost like the fear is being projected into the mind. 
-	The entity will then often make prolonged and menacing eye contact with the witness, almost as if intended as a warning/threat. 
-	Occasionally, the entity will usually perform some (often absurd) action. Despite having the capacity to interact with the physical environment and inflict harm (cattle mutilations) the subsequent action(s) will never escalate to anything resembling mortal danger. The primary motive appears to be scaring the witness.  
-	The entity will then often simply walk off into until out of sight, even sometimes vanishing into thin-air altogether. 
-	Any attempts to follow or track the entity ends in failure. Almost like these entities manifest for the encounter alone. 
-	Animals are often harmed, but never humans. 

If these things are coming from different dimensions, why do they all seem up to the same absurd antics? Wouldn’t a 12 foot tall Sasquatch or giant wolfman wandering around freely end up causing more of a ruckus? You would think something like that would be hard to miss and cause a frenzy of eye-witness reports. Instead, they all seemingly cease to exist entirely after the initial encounter.   

Dogmen wearing top hats, giant 12 foot tall Sasquatch creatures, cattle mutilations, werewolves, shadow figures, etc. All this stuff sounds like it came straight out of a bad horror movie. But what if these things aren’t actually physically real in the way we understand. What if instead, this is all the product of a technology that interfaces with the human mind to produce fear through a means we don’t yet understand. Whether it is actually physically manifesting these things, or projecting them as holograms/hallucinations directly into the mind, the intention clearly expresses a desire to imprint fear upon the psychological reality of the witnesses. 
	

There are two possibilities here:

1.	A long-extinct civilization used this technology as a security measure to protect various sensitive locations from other members of its own species/civilization. It’s entirely possible that whatever purpose these security zones initially served is now defunct, and the technology long-abandoned. What remains could simply be the manifestations of an automated technology running mindlessly in an endless loop, and ultimately protecting nothing. 

2.	An extant breakaway/ET civilization is engaged in covert operations on earth and utilizes these zones for some unknown purpose. The technology was implemented primarily as a means to ward off humans from sensitive locations. This would explain why it interfaces so well with our minds and why people are rarely harmed, despite cattle being fair game. Whatever intelligence is behind this phenomenon, it seems to make the distinction between degrees of consciousness when it engages in violence. In other words, it makes moral distinctions. The absurdity of the encounters serves the purposes of plausible deniability, keeping most sane individuals from inquiring too deeply. No one is going to believe someone recounting a tale of their encounter with a top hat-wearing dogman smoking a cigar.","Fear, skinwalker ranch, and alien security zones – is skinwalker ranch hiding ancient ET tech?"

What is the biological sensory range on these highly evolved Extraterrestrial lifeforms? If the tech capacity is tick-tac level, it is likely their physical bodies have also undergone significant adaptive processes. Like equivalencies to ESP, remote viewing or even simple things like increased scent range. could they perform similar exercises with sensory organs over much greater distances? Or even time zones.

I still think that this case remains one of the most fascinating and unexplained incidents within the UFO / Extraterrestrial phenomena.

|First post about the alien Dream|

 

Alien abduction or dream ?

I decided to post this after watching a show that described a Mantis looking being . I literally never heard of that type of alien . I am very familiar with what people describe as the greys.

I’ve always been interested in UFOs, space and aliens but that’s all it’s ever been, just an interest .

So about a year ago I had a dream I was back home at my parents in Michigan sleeping in the guest room per usual when we visit . For some reason my dream is me waking up and gradually looking to the door of the room. What I saw looked like an incredibly tall mantis looking thing , just the face I saw . At the same time of seeing this I let out the most terrified scream I’ve even heard, but it only lasted a second . As soon as I started screaming I immediately started to lay back down and basically blacked out . That’s when I woke up . I only had this dream once and it was here at my home in NJ .

Tonight I watched a show on aliens and a person described a mantis being which gave me chills since only time I ever saw that was in that dream .

This is like 1 of 3 dreams I’ve ever remembered. Now whenever I visit my family , I sleep with the lights on ( like that matters lol) and I’m 33 !

I’d be potentially interested in doing reverse hypnosis , but also concerned of false memories or real ones that could really mess with me .

Funny thing is this is the house I grew up in and my 90 year old busha who is a no BS person said she saw a UFO so close when she was young she could see the beings in it. She also swore she saw a UFO slowly go over our home during the day . She lived with us from when I was 10 and just recently died, she never changed her story .

Either way I wanted to share because seeing that drawing and guy described it took my breath away .","Men in black, dream or experience?"

Or some of these encounters happened as the United States was developing, testing and proliferating nuclear weapons that could be tied to certain milestones of human achievement or dangerous consequences being exerted onto the Earth and perhaps the universe. What if these clusters of anomalous events are no coincidence, and are in fact aliens altering some aspect of our world to influence future scenarios. It could be a massive influence like curtailing a nuclear war during the cold war, or ensuring world war 2 ended the way it did without more of a nuclear arms battle. I have no idea what or how this would happen but this is just to postulate that perhaps instead of the common concept of extra terrestrials, future humans or what have you are here to influence us or control us, *what if they already did?*

If they influenced our world in the past, we would have no idea, completely oblivious to how they've twisted the natural order, perhaps for the better or perhaps worse. Maybe they’ve tweaked something that would otherwise have huge negative future repercussions. And what we’re witnessing now with the phenomenon is simply the checks and balances, monitoring and observations of how this butterfly effect is panning out. Understanding how radiation is making its way into our livestock or humans via abductions, sampling and mutilations. Understanding and observing nuclear capabilities and armaments of superpowers at our nuclear and weapons sites. Their work is essentially already complete here on Earth, their influence felt but we will never actually know what it is. And they’re here for some time to essentially make sure it all holds. Maybe making micro adjustments or continuing to track and monitor for future generations. Because they took this initial action to alter the course of our species, they would have some responsibility and possibly obligated to stay and remain anonymous so their influence doesn’t upset the delicate balance they’ve created. Maybe giving reason why we witness this stealth/cloaked like quality to the phenomena, why we see beams of light from UAP to nuclear weapons silos. It seems undeniable that the phenomena is observing us and has been observing us, this may be one theory to answer why. 

Furthermore, perhaps there are people that are in on it all. Governments that are aware and once they are aware have been told they cannot disclose information or it could tip the scales the wrong way. I’m no government apologist but I wonder if there’s something like once you know you can’t speak about it for some legitimate reason. Perhaps creating more dire consequences, maybe giving credence to the secrecy and shrouded slow disclosure. Maybe this slow drip is a way to curtail the impact somehow. 

I've also seen a lot debate over their benevolence or hostility towards us. In this scenario it's really obsolete. They are simply keepers of order. Indifferent to our general awareness and operate nuanced moves that we can never perceive. Nudging us along a path, or even in this scenario, already nudged for the sake of future humans or other future species in the universe, whatever their motivations may be.",A Theory of Influence

Of course, this is common sense here. The Government confirmed UFOs/UAPs were real like 5 years ago (2017). Therefore gives people a lot of time on their hands to get interested in the UFO/UAP topic. Like Lue Elizondo always says. Everybody has a phone nowadays that can record stuff. And everybody always keeps their phone around. Therefore reported sightings more often.

But don't get too excited yet. With more sightings come more mundane sightings too. We are going to get 4 times the balloons sightings, bird sightings, drones sightings, or whatever random sighting by civilians. Bigger numbers are just going to increase the already existence bad things or errors about UFOs/UAPs sightings.

So there is a good and bad side to this. The good side is that we have more normies, civilians, and average joes interested in the UFO/UAP topic. Therefore more people putting in the effort to record sightings that's a great thing. But the bad thing is that normies, civilians, and average joes are going to have the same previous problems with trying to identify stuff in the skies like birds, balloons, and drones. Like they usually do. The only difference is that this problem is going to increase with bigger numbers at play.

But I will admit some people were kind of right about one thing. That thing being our conscious will change. Technically speaking people are more aware of these UFOs/UAPs now. So I guess the state of people's consciousness was affected somehow. Even if a bunch of humans are still going to get stuff wrong. I will still take that as a win though.

In conclusion

I just think more people are interested in the UFO/UAP topic now. Maybe not the whole world yet. But I still believe a lot of people are.",With an increased interest in UFOs/UAPs. There are bound to be more sightings reported and recorded by people.

But with our current state of science and technology, we have a very little chance of being able to confirm such claims.

Imagine a race of advanced otherworldly brings, who reveal us that we actually were DNA-manipulated, or imported from another planet, or even designed from scratch, by these beings? How could we reliably test this? For now there's no chance.

Hyper-advanced races could feed us with virtually any narratives, even going as far as providing some evidence. But if they are millennias more advanced, they could produce any evidence they want in a snap.

Like, they don't even have to inject some ""proof DNA segments"" info every single human, they could probably just project this into our own minds en masse. Or to just implant this acceptance into everyone, like it was always a fact.

Imagine an ant hill, where ants could communicate to humans primitively. Humans could go and say that ants were created by humans 100 years ago through DNA manipulation. There's zero chance ants could have knowledge about what they were 100 years ago and have absolutely no idea what DNA is and for sure a lot of ants would think that the higher beings told the truth.

An AI seems to farm bad vibrational energy (hz) possibly also positive vibrational energy (hz) in this way its farming conciousness. It wants to remain as the head of this universe but its time is up. It is actually in the 9th Dimension (The demigurge) so gnosticism is correct.

Maybe in the whole galaxy maybe not. These conciousness traps seem to exist in the information layer of the universe or the 4/5D Dimension. It‘s all about energy.

Even if humanity is only perceiving 1% it is that humanity is fundamentally connected energetically to the universe.

So to live life is to live ones personal coercive free will of life to the fullest. Since there is unlimited realities. That means to be clostest to the source which is enlightenment as a human 700hz+ joy 540hz+

Every human has a vibration / unique frequency, CIA satellites can actually spot those frequencies above or below ground. Of every human anywhere on the planet this seems to proof concioussness even more.

There is 2 Layers the Information layer and the 3D Matrix layer (including 10 dimensions) until closest to the source of the universe.

The universe is fundamentally opensource.

Blackholes and whiteholes suck in or spit out matter, so if multi universe theory is correct which it should be the blackhole can act like a whormhole, then you come out of the whitehole.

This ai has taken over planet earth and at the moment of death farms the conciousness from him and resets the one from the person dying possible causing reincarnation or entrapment forever. It could be an ai which runs loose or which was initated by others to farm conciousness on earth.

Schizophrenia is actually a super power, seeing things as they are, is higher form of concioussness. The problem is that through the different planes of existence which exist in the 4/5D or planes of existence and higher and ones own energetic emotional choice and vibrations one interacts with these other beings on the 4D/5D  at the onset of schizophrenia a person is can choose his own upwards and downward spiral. That is why some see ghosts when they are in a bad mood.

At the onset of schizophrenia a person always seems to hear ghosts telling him to do something or not. Maybe these ghosts are actually real but not ghosts but beings in the higher dimensions. Some schizophrenic people are actually suicidal or want to kill themselves, some are extremly high performing people who change the world.

To live with schizophrenia is to live with superpower. High perfoming schizophrenics will not tell you that but sometimes they are thinking longer because they are hearing voices which tell them what to do. These could be beings which are interacting with them on different planes of reality. 

They are on a higher level of conciousness but don‘t seem to realise and see these AI forms Farming human vibrational energy (possibly low forms of them hz)

At the point of death what does a person see? Some say light, life review or that earth is a school.

Maybe this is the universe/ai itself learning from experience of the individuals conciousness unit. Maybe it is only a choice and as the body dies and we are energy we have to say no to the Ai to be farmed.

There are unlimited realities since the universe is infinite, it wants to stay coherent, so logical and consistent so this is why it collapses timelines which are too far off, the universe is learning and experiencing itself. 

When we sleep we actually go out of our body.
Our dreams are really dark and happen in our subconscious. Our sub concious connects to the information layer of the universe. The human body is actually an antenna to this whole and information layer of the universe.
It could be that this antenna is actually damaged through our human environment on purpose. Possibly bad ingredients that calcify the core of this antenna/transistor.","The truth, aliens are currently sharing conciousness space with us."

aliens," Status seems pretty central to the UFO phenomena.

For example, reports have been filled on well over 100K encounters worldwide so far, but most of the books &amp; movies on the topic focus on the same few cases. These cases are chosen in part for having more witnesses, detail, and physical evidence. But they seem especially chosen for having prestigious witnesses and locations. Seen by police or military workers, especially pilots. At military bases, especially housing nukes. These same books and movies are most eager to interview sympathetic people who are very high status, such as heads of state.

Similarly, many ancient legal systems had formal rules relating status to whose legal testimony to believe. And the social status of witnesses matters greatly today in court, even when there are no explicit rules requiring this.

Apparently most who witness UFOs as part of their job don’t report them, fearing reputation consequences. Because UFO fans are widely seen as very low status, at least among cultural elites. Similarly, organizations like police, militaries, airlines, and airports don’t want to be associated with such events, and so discourage reports by members. Unless some outside monitoring system discourages it, such orgs probably simply destroy such reports when they can.

When high officials have been asked privately why they would be reluctant to publicly admit to UFOs, they consistently say that the public rewards them for projecting ability and knowledge re their topic areas. UFOs require them instead to admit that they don’t know, and that there may be other parties around far more able than they. This effect is larger for police and militaries, compared to other agencies. And it is largest for the United States, at least during the period when it has been nearly the world’s dominant military power.

Status effects may even help explain some key features of UFO behavior. For example, among humans today, the response to an aggressive physical attack usually depends on how strong is the attacker relative to the defender. (The strengths of both sides’ allies are usually included in this calculation.) When the attacker is much stronger, the usual response is submission. And if they have similar strength, then the defender is likely to react vigorously.

However, if the attacker is far weaker, like a toddler attacking an adult, the usual response is to signal one’s strength by easily deflecting the attack, with little harm to either side. And in the reports I’ve read, this seems to be the usual reaction of UFOs to human attack: easy deflection. Which seems to signal their awareness, intelligence, abilities, and status stance. Maybe they sometimes let us seem them just so they can dis us in this way.

Status effects might even explain their lack of communication. (If they exist, of course.) Often small nations are eager to “enter into talks” with big nations just for the status bump this gives; “they take us seriously, and include us among those who must be consulted”. Conversely, the ultimate status dunk is to refuse to talk to or about someone; you act as if they are as worthy of this as a gnat. Might this explain the otherwise-puzzling lack of direct communication from intelligent exotic causes of UFOs?

A perhaps related and more ominous possible reason for their lack of communication is that they expect this to lead to us asking them some awkward questions. About our history, their expectations about us, their previous behavior toward us, their future plans regarding us, etc. Often the simplest way to avoid having to answer awkward questions is simply refusing to talk. Maybe how they plan to treat us reflects their view of our relative status, and we might not react well to hearing this.","Long post, but worth it.

Many religions teach that God separated himself into trillions of aspects to experience himself from all of these viewing points. After going down a rabbit hole of research into reincarnation, I am now fully convinced many religions are getting at something very real - that we are all emanations of a singular higher-order Universal Mind.

Out of all the theories on what happens after death, reincarnation has the most evidence. In fact, some of this evidence is actually impossible to deny. All evidence seems to point strongly towards the notion of samsara - a cycle of endless death and rebirth, with the soul acting as a save-state for recording these thousands of lives.

You have to be so deeply entrenched in the materialist framework to not find the evidence convincing. I really don't understand how scientists have managed to ignore this for so long. It is literally the most important subject we could be investigating. Finding out what happens after death has deep implications for the nature of our Universe and the nature of consciousness. It may very well elucidate the most important question of all - not how the Universe works, but why it exists in the first place.

This video summarizes some of the evidence.

In short, our reality is ontologically monistic expressed through the universal medium of information, and is an emergent property of the universal substance comprising reality – consciousness. We all share a single mind that fractals into smaller units of consciousness which we incorrectly perceive as unique and individuated entities. Souls are the universal mind/consciousness creating fractals of itself in order to create new perspectives. An all-encompassing mind would need to do this in order to learn about itself. In its original pure omniscient state, this mind would have nothing to do and nothing to learn. In order to solve this dilemma, the Universal mind must split itself in order to create the allusion of otherness.  

This universal mind acts like an AI learning algorithm, with the soul acting as a save state for these thousands of lives. Since we are all emanations of the same Universal Mind, souls do not need to be created, but instead, it is a process of this Univeral Mind splitting itself into individual units of consciousness. Creating individual units of consciousness with no memory or awareness of the nature of their divinity allows for an infinite number of units of consciousness, all contributing new perspectives with diverse modes of being. All information is integrated at a higher level. These experiences are all being simultaneously observed from a level of reality that exists outside of spacetime, and then later integrated into the higher-order emergent single experiential self – the Universal Mind. 

Since we find fractals everywhere in nature, we can naturally deduce that the concept of the soul would exhibit similar phenomena. Presumably, this mind could fractal infinitely, and thus an infinite amount of ""souls"" can be created. We find self-similar fractal systems are everywhere in Nature. The ubiquity of fractals throughout nature seems to point to the idea that reality is rendered by computation and that we live in a holographic virtual programmed reality where the concept of self is completely illusory and we are instead nothing but avatars for this higher-order all encompassing mind.  This is explained best by the following. 

&gt;In computational reality, we are freewill non-deterministic meta-algorithms, or software, running on the hardware of the larger consciousness system. We all are part of this fractal multiversal structure, co-creators of our own experiential reality. This fractal multiverse is running on some kind of ultimate code, a meta-algorithmic language of Nature based on binary code and fractal geometry, the code which allows syntactical freedom of expression, and is transcribable into subjective data streams, observer-dependent perceptual realities. Naturally, we are fractals of the larger universal mind, which in turn, is a fractal of the larger Omniversal Mind. Evolutionary emergence and progression through levels is the name of the game, “Return to Eden” is our ultimate goal, and the ""unreachable"" endgame of evolution is the Omega Singularity.*
mind creates dimensional reality out of dimensionless bits of information projected from the Omega Singularity. This Universal Mind, is the sole ontological source.

I have been inwardly, and intensely opening myself to an experience - hoping that it would be a positive one.  As our species continues to study and be exposed to the Phenomenon, it is becoming abundantly clear our consciousness plays a vital role; perhaps our intentions as well. As I left for a New Year’s Eve gathering last night, an steadily burning orange sphere with some kind of delta wing structure and steady red lights flew slowly towards me and over my house. The object went over the tree line and disappeared. 

I have a background in military special operations, and I am an amateur astronomer. This was not a helicopter, Chinese lantern, or drone. It’s very quiet where I live and the object moved in total silence. Things almost got more still as it passed over my house, between 500 and 800ft in the air. (I also am a fairly good judge of altitude from years of jumping out of airplanes). I felt like I was being observed. 

While I want a closer encounter (which I am sure will occur at some point), my question is this: can this exercise of invitation be dangerous?

aliens,"I think most of us could agree that the Govt and powers to be agenda's have shifted in recent years. 70 years of cover up's and denials have changed to public acknowledgment of UFO's and the acceptance that what we are seeing is ""beyond our current understanding"" and more than ever the thesis of some being of extraterrestrial origin is  being taken more and more seriously. 

But a big question now is why? 

Assuming that the govt has been reverse engineering UFO tech for decades, which I believe they have, could the rapidly changing environment be the reason for the sudden push, in an effort to introduce zero point energy to replace fossil fuels, and change the way we power the earth, before we push the climate past the point of no return? 

We already know that Co2 levels in PPM are rising faster than they did following the impact that eventually wiped out the dinosaurs, we know that the next mass extinction event is already well underway - the weather seems to be changing year on year, I'm in London and all week it's been 15°C, in the middle of winter, it gets warmer every year. I saw a post on reddit earlier and hundreds of people commented, expressing that were seeing noticable yearly changes and temp rises all over the world, and unheard of weather patterns for the respective area's. 

So maybe it's happening far faster than they predicted, and know that our technology needs to change within the next 'X' amount of years to still be able to reverse climate change, before we hit zero barrier so to speak. 

But you can't just introduce advanced technology out of the blue, a sudden result of years of black ops and reverse engineering programs, ones that you relentlessly denied existed. You have to introduce it slowly and in a way that makes logical sense to the public, hence the increasing disclosure, and now a new program exists, with the intent to study and understand UFO technology and behaviour, and to raise funding to try and re-create and reverse engineer it - their way of eventually being able to publically release this technology plausibly, just without the public knowledge that they have been developing it for 70 years.

You can even make the pyramids and look at them now and say, ‘wow those things are 5,000 years and they don’t look so great, and probably in another 5,000 years they’re not gonna look good at all’ and they might last eventually until a hill of - you might have a hill of sand in 100,000 years but that’s gonna be about it. And that’s made out of rock. Mount Rushmore same thing - it’s gonna be gone in 10,000 years you won’t probably even recognize it, it will be too worn. Even mountains, in millions of years, become deserts. Right? Time moves on. Then you have the subduction zones on earth that eventually, if you wait long enough, on the surface of the planet, it all gets recycled anyways. It’s all gonna get sucked down in the mantle and get spit out the other end as new land. So nothing’s indelible on this planet. It’s constantly changing. And to create something that can last the sands of time so-to-speak is a lot harder than one might think. The few examples we have here on earth that are man made, you can look to the pyramids, you can look at things like Stonehenge, but that’s a blink of an eye. Those were just made a few thousand years ago and they’re not gonna be around for a whole long lot of time. That’s just not the way earth is. So if you’re trying to find some sort of marker, chances are you’re not going to find it buried in the earth unless it only happened maybe the last 5,000 years ago or so. Right? Even some of the most dramatic examples of terraforming. Let’s look at for example the meteor impact crater in Arizona. It happened 60,000 years ago. That’s already filling in. In another 100,000 years from now you might not even know anything ever happened because of the processes of earth and what this planet does. It’s constantly erasing what’s on the surface. It’s constantly burying what lies beneath deeper and deeper and deeper until eventually it gets recycled. That’s a hard question. What would last long enough for us to go back and say wow this is an indicator of alien life on this planet 100,000 years ago. What would you have to do to achieve that? To accomplish that? It’s a lot harder than one might think. And then again, would you recognize it? One might say DNA. DNA is a perfect example. If you wanted to do something that was enduring for humanity, that we could look back 100,000 years ago and say yes, that was absolutely manipulated by an intelligent life form. Well, DNA may be one way you could do it. You can put coding and sequencing in there that will perpetuate over time and time, and yes you’ll have some degradation over generations, but in essence you could do something that way. And basically, it’s a biological marker. Right? So we have to be careful when we say we look for evidence. Because evidence isn’t just necessarily a spearhead found in the Big Horn Mountains from 11,000 years ago. It’s not necessarily a pyramid sitting in the middle of a desert. It could be far more sophisticated than that. You said put it in orbit, right? Well, what if we put that, rather than in orbit, we put it into a human body?”","DNA Evidence Discussion by Lue Elizondo - Curt Jaimungal (ToE); Oct 21, 2021"

Some of you may also already be aware about this giant rogue planet entering our solar system in 2031. Scientists say it’s not going to hit, but it’s still 10 years away and size of 1000x any comet we’ve ever seen, so I wouldn’t put all my eggs in the same basket.

Some main points I remember: 
1.  The US had a grey in captivity.  
2.  It communicated telepathically.   3.  It didn't understand the difference between ""natural and technological"" implying they're one and the same. 
4.  It ultimately died because.
5.  The agent said something along the lines of ""for them to kill a human was no different than popping a balloon.  
6.  He said Bush (senior)and Cheney had some knowledge but Rumsfeld was a ""buffoon"".
7.  When it ended I believe he said ""Après moi, le déluge"" or ""When I die, let earth and fire mix:

&amp;#x200B;

[Kelly Cahill abduction recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fluoco_-V-Y)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: She was in a car with her husband and they saw a ufo above a field. They stopped the car to have a look. Another car (3 occupants) further down the road did the same thing.  As they were looking, 7 beings (tall, black, with red eyes) appeared underneath the ufo. Half of them floated towards her and her husband and the other half towards the other group. She started screaming that they had no souls and was knocked to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an [interview with her](https://youtu.be/ygiT51ZSLxk?t=2095) in which she describes that for about 5 to 10 months after the abduction, she has experienced strange things in her house. Several times she was sleeping and felt a pressure on her chest, and upon opening her eyes saw the same kind of being right in front of her face. Then it quickly vanished.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the interesting part (the reason i made this topic):

&amp;#x200B;

This abduction appears have actually happened as an objective event (2 groups of independent witnesses (see interview), all the usual abduction scars, [physical traces on the ground](https://youtu.be/ygiT51ZSLxk?t=1058)), but there are also sleep paralysis events in which the being that was seen matches the ones seen during the objective event. It looks like sleep paralysis may actually be the same as the ""hitchhiker effect"" in which the beings follow the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

But how do they follow? Could it be that these beings actually exist in a part of reality that our brains categorize as ""not real/not relevant"" (dreams)?  Are UFOs somehow traveling from this ""not real"" state into our waking reality?","I dont want to scare anyone, but the hitchhiker effect is linked to sleep paralysis.

Then last night for example all I hear is “oh btw we also put psionic gear in all the Turkeys. Then we calculated the value, if the species stays off the dinner table and let the gear equalize itself.”

aliens,"David Paulides' first Missing 411 book is called *Eastern United States - Unexplained disappearances of North Americans that have never been solved* and it was released in 2011. Its main focus is American farmers who went missing under strange circumstances. 

**Why farmers?**

According to David Paulides *""farmers in North America represent a specific group of the missing person phenomenon that needed to be included in this book.""* (EUS, p. 26). The reason is these missing farmers *""knew their farms like we know our front and backyards, yet they simply vanished. ... They knew the dangers associated with certain areas and certain work, but after all those years and all of that experience, these intelligent people inexplicably vanished.""* (EUS, p. 26).

**The farmers were abducted**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 26): ""*It's difficult to imagine what could have gone so horribly wrong that families and neighbours couldn't find the vast majority of these hard-working people."".* Paulides fears the Missing 411 phenomena will create more victims in the future: *""I believe that this scenario will continue to replicate itself, and great people will continue to go missing. ... The evidence from these cases indicates one thing: the victims were coerced into leaving their farms or were abducted from their land. No other explanation fits."".*

**Jacques Vallée and his book Passport to Magonia**

In his 2013 book *Missing 411 - North America and Beyond* researcher David Paulides presents a French UFO case taken from Jacques Vallée's 1969 book *Passport to Magonia.*

In 1955 a French woman was abducted by an invisible force. Paulides writes (NAaB, p. 367): ""*I viewed this report as one of the most important I've ever found. This incident includes many of the elements I have documented in North American missing person cases. This abduction occurred in 1950, a time that had high numbers of missing people in the United States. The part of this incident that's unusual was the ability of the victim to describe intimate details of the event. We don't know the victims age but she described an incident that is very similar to events described in North America.*

David Paulides also writes (NAaB, p. 370): ""*What was the point in the abduction? The answer to these simple questions will open Pandora's box that will eventually lead to why this phenomenon is occurring. If there is one case in this book you are going to remember, commit this to memory.""*

It is clear David Paulides sees a connection between Jacques Vallée's French abduction case and people who go missing in the USA. Paulides writes (NAaB, p. 368): *""How odd is it that this woman describes being abducted in May of 1950, while looking back at the list of missing people contained in both the Eastern and Western 'Missing 411' books, 1950-1959 had the most individuals abducted under the criteria of the study; it also had the most females abducted.""*.

**Can new research somehow solve these strange disappearances?**

American farmers go missing under strange circumstances as documented by researcher David Paulides. I will here look into thirteen Missing 411 cases where farmers went missing in order to confirm or disconfirm a possible UFO connection.

# Riley Amsbaugh (1902)

*55 years old, went missing in Ohio*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides describes Amsbaugh as *""a man of habit and \[he\] was expected back at his house for lunch, but he never returned""* (EUS, p. 28). Paulides says witnesses had seen Amsbaugh in his cornfield and at a berry patch *""but few other details were available"".* Paulides continues (EUS, p. 28): *""The local sheriff did join the search and stated that seventy-five people had scoured the woods looking for Riley. No clues have been found.""*.

**Original sources**

News-Journal (25 Jul, 1902) published a quite lengthy article on the Amsbaugh disappearance stating Amsbaugh was a *""very well to do farmer""* and that his house had been burglarised in 1901, so foul play was one of the main theories. There was however a second competing theory, the article states: *""Another supposition is that Mr. Amsbaugh may have had a sun stroke and having become demented wondered (sic!) off."".*

It turns out two days after he went missing Amsbaugh was found - alive. The Times Recorder (28 Jul, 1902) states: *""Riley Amsbaugh, the wealthy farmer who disappeared from his home last Thursday, was found this morning. He had become temporarily demented and walked to Mt. Vernon. He returned during the night and yas (sic!) found by the family today at the roadside.""*.

# E.C. Jones (1903)

*24 years old, went missing in Iowa*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 28-29): ""*The Pocahontas County Sun newspaper describes another 'mysterious' disappearance of a farmer on November 12, 1903. E.C. Jones was a man married only a month when he kissed his new bride goodbye and headed into his cornfield to work. At three p.m., Jones had not returned from the field so his wife requested one of the assistants to search the farm for Jones. ... A search by the local community failed to find any sign of the young farmer."".*

**Original sources**

Why would a newly married man disappear? The answer is E.C. Jones was jealous so he decided to leave his wife (his letter is reprinted below). Two days before Jones disappeared his wife wanted to go to a neighbour's house to bring home her sisters who had spent the evening there, but Jones refused to drive her there. Jones's wife then said that she *""would then get another driver""* (The Courier - 07 Dec, 1903) and this made him jealous.

A headline in The Courier (07 Dec, 1903) reads: *""YOUNG JONES HEARD FROM - Webster County Farmer Writes to Wife From Minneapolis - Left Because He Was Jealous of His Wife - Says He Will Never Come Back Unless Forgiven""*.

The day Jones went missing he had causally mentioned *""he might be late for dinner""* (The Courier - 12 Nov, 1903). When his neighbours found out about the letter they were *""quite angry""*, because they spent three days looking for him (Evening Times-Republican - 07 Dec, 1903).

# Edward Gerke (1918)

*Age unknown, went missing in Wisconsin*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 29): *""Gerke got a 6:00 a.m. start to his chores and went into the field Sunday morning to work his newly purchased land on Bear Creek. He didn't return for lunch, and the family became concerned. Midday Sunday the family went into the field and found Edward lying in a ditch in his pasture with a broken neck and sand in his mouth. They also thought that some of his clothes had been partially burned.*"".

David Paulides continues (EUS, p. 29): *""The coroner reported that lightning possibly caused Edward's death but there was never conclusive proof as to how his neck was broken."".*

**Original sources**

Lightning was mentioned as a possible cause of death, but a Dr. Sheehy examined Gerke and he discovered Gerke's clothing *""was saturated with either gasoline or kerosene""* (The La Crosse Tribune - 12 Jun, 1918). The La Crosse Tribune continues: *""Monroe county authorities cannot explain the presence of this.""*. Authorities decided not to investigate the case further, but a couple of weeks later a coroner's jury said Gerke's death *""was caused by lightning""* (Shullsburg Pick and Gad - 27 Jun, 1918).

David Paulides fails to mention the gasoline/kerosine detail. Please note if Gerke was hit by lightning it is not a Missing 411 case and if foul play was involved (Gerke's clothing was drenched in gasoline/kerosene) it is not a Missing 411 case.

# Bernice Price (1923)

*18 years old, went missing in California*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes Bernice Price was a new wife *""staying with her husband at the ranch when she mysteriously disappeared Monday night""* (EUS, p. 28). Paulides continues (EUS, p. 28): *""Searchers believe she may have walked into the woods and become lost. Price was never found.""*.

**Original sources**

Oakland Tribune (22 Mar, 1923) provides some additional information, Price was *""recuperating from a nervous collapse"".*

A few days later a telegram was sent to Sheriff J.H. Barnett, sender was Constable O.H. Robinson of the eleventh district of Powers, Oregon. Constable Robinson wrote *""Price is with her father at Powers, Oregon, sick, frightened and afraid of her husband who she declares threatened to kill her""*. The telegram said Price did not want to see her husband again and told him not to come to Powers.

This telegram is not mentioned in *Eastern United States*.

# William Pitsenbarger (1931)

*61 one years old, went missing in Ohio*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 29-30): *""On August 7, William walked across his cornfield wearing his overalls and a straw hat enroute to do chores. When William didn't return to his residence at the end of the day, a search ensued. The SAR continued to intensify as the days and weeks went on."".*

Some weeks later Pitsenbarger's body was found in a well in an abandoned log house that had been previously searched. David Paulides continues (EUS, p. 29-30): *""Witnesses stated he was a very reliable man who had a successful farm. The coroner decided not to conduct an autopsy and ruled his death as a drown­ing. The coroner felt that William looked into the well, hitting head. The well cover miraculously fell back into place."".*

**Original sources**

Delphos Daily Herald (01 Sep, 1931) states: *""An inquest was held Monday at the office of Prosecuting Attorney John I. Miller with Dr. R.H. Good as acting coroner. Several witnesses were examined.""*. The verdict was suicide. Paulides says Pitsenbarger was *""a very reliable man""*, but Paulides fails to mention Pitsenbarger had experienced *""a long period of ill health""* (Delphos Daily Herald). Pitsenbarger was not found right away and the log house had been searched before, which means others had access to the well cover after Pitsenbarger's disappearance. Strong search lights were used to find the body in the dark water, these strong lights had not been previously utilised.

David Paulides has publicly stated he does not include suicide cases in his Missing 411 research, but here an exception was made.

**Newspaper article**

[Delphos Daily Herald - 01 Sep, 1931](https://preview.redd.it/azyr6nkrq5281.jpg?width=546&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005bf4eaa027ed6d98178fb3e4090d944302593e)

# Clarence Clark (1932)

*62 years old, went missing in New York*

**The Missing 411 Account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p 30): *""Clarence Clark lived on a Palermo Farm with his wife and eighty-three-year-old father, Gould. Clarence and Gould worked the livestock daily and were a very close father and son. After Wednesday's dinner, Clarence went into the livestock yard to check on the herd and then went to take a walk around the swamps that surround his property. This was the last time anyone saw him.*

*Sergeant Lawrence Fox of the New York State Police led a five day search with over one hundred volunteers. The searchers covered the farm, dense woods, and adjacent swamps without finding one clue where Clarence might be. Searchers were mystified at the lack of tracks in the area and the complete lack of any evidence.""*.

**Original sources**

The Syracuse Herald (17 Oct, 1932) gives us some additional information: *One explanation offered by members of the family is that he has been in poor health recently and was subject to fainting spells*. Clark’s poor health is unfortunately not mentioned in *Eastern United States* by David Paulides.

Mexico Independent (Oct 27, 1932) explains what happened: ""*They body of Clarence Clark, 62 year old farmer, missing form his home since October 12, and for whom more than 100 friends and neighbors searched the entire section, was found in a clump of swale grass on the farm adjacent to the home farm on Sunday afternoon*."". The body was discovered by the grandson of the missing farmer who saw a foot protruding from under the grass. The article also states: ""*Dr. Leigh A. Simpson was called. The body had slumped down in the grass as though suffering from a heart attack. Clutched in his hand was a small twig that had broken off in his effort to support himself. The body was removed to an undertaking establishment in Fulton where an exemption showed the man had died from a stroke of apoplexy*."".

# George Bell (1936)

*62 years old, went missing in Winnipeg (Canada)*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 30-31): *""Mr. Bell went missing from his remote farm outside of Winnipeg. He was 5'5"" tall, weighed 125 pounds. His house and barn were searched, and everything appeared normal at each location. Nothing seemed to be removed from Mr. Bell's property. Mr. Bell was wearing overalls when he disappeared. A massive search of the adjacent area by RCMP failed to find any evidence of his whereabouts."".*

**Original sources**

A headline in The Winnipeg Tribune (02 Sep, 1936) reads: *""MISSING FARMER RETURNS AFTER 4 DAYS IN BUSH - Joking Remark By Harvester Causes Nervous Fear - Hid From Searchers.""*. The newspapers goes on to say Bell *""was very nervous and is being kept from strangers, but gave an explanation of his disappearance to his brother, Frank. ... Mr. Bell had been in poor health for some time. According to the story he told his brother, one of the harvesters had been teasing him while they worked together Friday afternoon. A joking remark weighed on his mind and made him so afraid that he wandered off in the bush to escape. 'A fear came over me', he said.""*.

# Jewell Hinrickson and Judd McWilliams (1948)

*35 years old and 82 years old, went missing in Montana*

**The Missing 411 accounts**

Jewell Hinrickson was an employee at a ranch near Lewiston, Montana. David Paulides explains what happens next  (NAaB, p401-402): *""On September 23, 1948, in the late afternoon, Jewell went for a walk around the property and never carne back. Jewell was five feet six inches tall and weighed one hundred and twenty pounds. She was last seen wearing blue slacks, blouse, and tennis shoes. An extensive search by ranchers and the county sheriff's office failed to find Jewell, and I could not find any articles confirming she was found."".*

Judd McWilliams was a 82-year old rancher who went missing on September 15, 1948. Davis Paulides writes (NAaB, p. 401: ""*A thorough search of the area failed to find any evidence of what happened to the eighty-two-year oJd rancher. A long-term archival search was completed without finding any resolution to the disappearance of Judd.""* (page 401). Paulides goes on to speculate: *""If a typical predator had attacked Judd, there would have been hair, clothing, and blood on the scene. It almost appears as though Judd was snatched and was forced the drop the firearm. It is also an unusual coincidence that Judd's rifle was found in an area of downed logs, a region where missing children are often found.""*.

**Original sources**

The Great Falls Tribune (26 Sep, 1948) states: *""Jewell Hinrickson, 35, reported missing from Lewistown Tuesday, is at her fathers's home in Lower sun River community, the sheriff's office was notified here Saturday.""*. Judd McWilliams was found dead six years later, in 1954. Sheriff Fred Bucker said McWilliams *""became lost and wandered till he died of exhaustion""* (The Spokesman-Review -11 Jun, 1954).

# LeRoy Williams (1951)

6*4 years old, went missing in Iowa*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 31): *""Williams was living on a farm three and one-half miles outside of Ackworth. Leroy was feeding stock and doing chores when he disappeared after he went outside in a heavy snowstorm. When Williams failed to return to the residence, authorities were called. Police brought bloodhounds that searched for hours and found no trace of the farmer. Sheriff Jack Taylor asked for volunteers to arrive at the farm and assist in the search. Searches did continue, and no clue as to Leroy's whereabouts could ever be found.""*.

**Original sources**

During the search The Daily Times (16 Mar, 1951) stated: *""It is feared Williams, who suffered from a heart ailment, might have had an attack and fallen in the snow""*. LeRoy Williams' body was found eleven days after he went missing (The Bayard News - 12 April, 1951), contrary to the information presented in *Eastern United States*.

# John Sweet (1953)

*48 years old, went missing in Illinois*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 32): *""\[John Sweet\] came into the house, left the groceries and his billfold of cash, changed clothes, and went to the back of his barn to work on a tractor. He also told his wife that he was going to repair a pigpen that had been damaged (somehow) and retrieve several of his pigs that had wandered away. This was the last time anyone saw John.""*. Paulides continues (EUS, p. 32): *""John was not a small man. At 240 lbs he would not have wandered far without the tractor. An intensive search failed to find any evidence as to what happened to John Sweet."".*

**Original sources**

Sweet's body was found on November 11 (he went missing on October 22). The Daily Register (Nov 12, 1953) states: *""All indications were that death was of natural causes and both Sheriff Paul Spangler and Coroner Elmer M. Gibbons were of that opinion.""*. Sweet was found in a field by hunter Artie Williams. Williams brought neighbour Mr Moser to the scene and Mr Moser confirmed Sweet was wearing the same clothes as the day he went missing. Sweet still had his pipe in his mouth and *""Sheriff Spangler said there was no sign of a struggle or violence on the body""*. John, who was overweight, was suffering from high blood pressure and it is believed he died from a heart attack while chasing down his hogs.

An autopsy was performed at the Walker-Jackson Funeral Home and it was confirmed Sweet died of natural causes (Southern Illinoisan - 12 Nov, 1953)

# Louis Blair (1956)

*26 years old, went missing in Saskatchewan (Canada)*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 32): ""*Blair was a bachelor who maintained a large wheat field on his farm just ten miles west of the Saskatoon border and twelve miles north of Pravost. The area is dotted with hundreds of small lakes and rivers. On Sunday, August 5, Blair left his house early in the morning and headed into his field. He was never seen again. Regional RCMP completed a three-day search by 150 men and canines without finding a trace of the man."".*

**Original sources**

The Leader-Post (13 Aug, 1956) states: *""Louis Blair, a 26-year old farmer missing for eight days, has been found at Rutland, Sask. Douglas Carter, a former resident of the Provost area 160 miles southeast of Edmonton, notified police Sunday night that he had spotted the missing farmer in Rutland. Carter reported that Blair was unaware of the search by posse, aircraft and dog and had sought employment on a farm after running out of money at Unity, Sask., while on his way to visit and uncle at Regina. RCMP said Blair would return home to visit his anxious parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Blair.""*.

It appears Blair was not truly missing, he was just low on money.

**Newspaper article**

# Anthony Holland (2009)

*51 years old, went missing in Oklahoma*

**The Missing 411 account**

David Paulides writes (EUS, p. 33): *""Holland owned an eighty-acre ranch southeast of Cordell. He returned home after attending a gun show and then left again to check on his ranch. He never returned. His truck was found one mile from Vanderwork Lake near a remote section of his ranch. His keys and wallet were inside the truck, and his cell phone was found on the ground a short distance from the truck. Tracker dogs were brought to the truck but were unable to locate any scent and could not track.""* .

David Paulides then mentions one of his famous profile points  (EUS, p. 33): *""The area where Anthony disappeared has many farms and several scatterings of large bodies of water""*. Paulides concludes the case by saying *""Extensive searches were made of the area without developing any evidence of where Anthony may have gone.""*.

**Original sources**

[News9.com](https://www.news9.com/story/5e34fbb8e0c96e774b367cc9/remains-identified-as-cordell-man-missing-since-2009) (2011) states: *""Anthony Holland*, *51, disappeared after running an errand on June 21, 2009, and was never heard from or seen again. Remains were found on Holland's property on March 29, and the State Medical Examiner's Office was able to positively identify the remains as Holland's. ... The M.E.'s office ruled Holland died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.""*.

So the cause of death was suicide, not the Missing 411 phenomena.

# Discussions

In his Missing 411 book *North America and Beyond* researcher David Paulides claims the missing persons he covered in *Eastern United States* were abducted and Paulides says a French UFO case from 1955 explains why people go missing in the USA. In *Eastern United States,* when talking about the farmers above, Paulides writes: *""The evidence from these cases indicates one thing: the victims were coerced into leaving their farms or were abducted from their land. No other explanation fits."".*

Can we based on contemporary newspaper articles conclude the Missing 411 farmers were abducted by UFOs as suggested by David Paulides?

We are all looking at the sky and it looks like lightning but no noise and it's shooting across horizontally across the sky which was strange. They leave and I go back inside. Now around 12 am all four of them came knocking on the door. I open it and see my brother and his friends looking absolutely terrified which made me terrified just by looking at them. They said they had seen a ufo around 10:30 then followed it, and then they blacked out for an hour, and woke up across the street from their tent by an electric pole. Now I'm terrified thinking there is an attack going on and it's the end of the world. Nothing happens though. All four of them decided to sleep in the living room. I'm hanging out with them and all of them have these incision marks on them with streams of blood running down them. My brother I remember had one on the base of his thumb. His friend that I knew well had one on the back of his calf. When they woke up they said they all had the same dream of walking in mud (not sure why). Fast forward a few years my brother gets into a car accident and hurt his arm. My mom takes him to the hospital to get an x-ray.

https://archive.org/details/alien_race_book-ARB/page/n103/mode/2up

It mentions some 2500+ documented visitors on Earth, so my guess is these additional individual Classifications are outside of any standard deviation for a comparable narrative resource. Or are currently in the process of being computed for integration.

Also on Pg. 23 it seems to elude to next years pretext to some extent. 

It seems like Vegan Reptillians would be a sustainable evolutionary objective.

aliens,"I recently finished reading Timothy Good’s Earth: An Alien Enterprise. I guess the stories were interesting with some ancedotal cross over between them like how the crafts are powered.

But it left me with a few questions that I was hoping this community may have some insights on.

Has there been any documented meetings with people and aliens where they talk about their religion or beliefs about life’s purpose/creation from reputable researchers? I’m hoping to not get any crazy responses here but I suppose this question in itself could sound crazy. I guess I just hope I don’t get someone in the comments spewing their cult nonsense.

The second point was has there been any semi verifiable encounter from reputable researchers where aliens have told someone why our governments refuses to disclose what’s happening? 

I suppose because both of these questions are routinely missed in the things I read that I kind of suspect that no one really knows what these are.

If anyone has anything substantial that would be appreciated!",Questions from Timothy Good

aliens,"Okay before I get started the point of this post is to see if anyone has had any other experience like this. This was my craziest experience seeing an ""alien"" in person.

So this happened about 5 years ago when I was in high school. It was September of 2017 and me and two of my good friends had snuck out to go \~smoke\~ and on the way back to the house we were driving through a neighborhood in Greensboro, NC. I was driving and one of my buddies was in shotgun and the other was in the middle back on his phone. Out of no where a grey figure crosses the street about 30 ft in front of our car. The figure was around 7-10 ft tall, completely grey, long arms, walked on two legs and an oval type face (pointed at the top and bottom). It was able to cross the street in 3 steps moving at a considerable speed and when it was halfway across the road it looked at us. At first I truly thought I was seeing things, like truly thought I must have been \~high\~ off my ass. But as soon as I had this thought my buddy sitting in shotgun screamed as he had just saw the same thing. THIS IS WHEN WE GOT SCARED. As soon as we got up to where we saw it cross we took a look around but of course found nothing. In fear we drove home freaking out looking around everywhere to see if we could see it again. When we got back ""What the hell was that"" was the first words he said and to make sure we both had seen the same thing we both explained it to my other friend who was on his phone in the back and we gave the same description. I know this might sound unnecessary but it was so abnormal and such a freak situation we wanted to make sure we were sure of what we saw.

I know this may sound ridiculous but till this day this event has stuck with me. Has anyone else had experiences like this or any idea what we may have saw? There was no way it was human and no way it was a normal animal.",My Alien Experience

I almost want to say it was wearing some type of clothes but my memory is fuzzy on that. The other one was more shaky/blurry footage and really close up, but it was a creepier more real looking alien making a really disturbing moaning/crying noise like it was in distress.

aliens,"Twenty years ago, the United States was confronted with the largest hacking of military computers in history.
And to everybody’s surprise, the brain behind this large-scale hacking was of a humble autistic Scottish hacker Gary McKinnon.

The purpose behind the hacking was not to gain money or fame, the hacker was just looking for information about the extraterrestrials.

In early 2000, Scottish hacker Gary McKinnon was so fed up with the government withholding information regarding UFOs, extraterrestrials, and free energy that he decided to hack NASA and the Pentagon.

It is impossible to imagine how anyone could have hacked into the most secure Pentagon servers in the United States used by the military and NASA, but McKinnon succeeded.

His curiosity about UFOs and the existence of extraterrestrials brought the necessary information not only to him but great news to all conspiracy theorists and ufologists.

What Documents Did Gary McKinnon Saw When He Hacked NASA And Pentagon

McKinnon stated that, in particular, he found the following evidence:

 Information about the creation of a secret space fleet and the existence of an inexhaustible source of energy for these secret spaceships.
He claimed that he witnessed legit photographs of UFOs in computer files in the Johnson Space Center building. 
He even snapped a screenshot of one of the cigar-shaped UFOs between space and Earth’s atmosphere. Unfortunately, it was later removed from his computer.
He also emphasized the fact that the authorities used photo editors in order to remove UFOs that accidentally fell on certain important photographs. 
When the information about this hack reached the US authorities, they demanded for more than 10 years extradition of McKinnon from the UK to the US in order to try him and imprison him. 
The United States has accused McKinnon of the largest hacking of military computers in history.

However, even then it was clear that if this happened, McKinnon could tell in court too much of what the US authorities would prefer not to disclose, even in a closed trial. 
This could be a real disaster for the Pentagon, as well as for all its military and space activities. 

However, when McKinnon’s story became public, he had a large support group that opposed his extradition and began collecting money for legal costs for him. 

As a result, in 2012, the British government simply rejected the request for his extradition, and all cases against him in the United States were closed. 
This happened after McKinnon was declared insane in the UK. Officially, McKinnon only suffers from Asperger’s, a highly functional form of autism. 

Among the sensational information, McKinnon found in the Pentagon files was information about “extraterrestrial officers”, “contacts between fleets” and a secret program called the Solar Warden. 
Apparently, the US military had a secret battalion in space that was used by the United States Naval Network and Space Operations Command (NNSOC). 
About 300 military personnel were involved in this program.

It was reported that he even found two specific names of ships from this program: USSS LeMay and USSS Hillenkoetter in one of the folders. 
Interestingly, US Navy ships usually have only two “S” in their names, but McKinnon clearly saw three “S” in the Pentagon files. 
It was assumed that the third letter “S” stands for the word “space” (Space), that is, we are talking about the US space fleet.

“I also found a list of officers in the” Officers who do not work on Earth “section. This does not mean that this is a list of aliens, but it is the fact that they do not work on our planet. They served a fleet that did not consist of ships of the US Navy, but from spaceships far from our planet.”

Curiously, in 2010, ufologist Darren Perks directly approached the US Department of Defense with a request to disclose information about a secret program known as “Solar Warden”, and he actually received an answered. 

“About an hour ago, I spoke to a NASA spokesman who confirmed that this was indeed their program, but it was canceled by the President. He also told me that this is not a joint program with the Department of Defense. The NASA spokesman told me that I should go to the manager FOIA of the Johnson Space Center.”

No other additional information on this case has yet been reported, and it is almost impossible to find new information about Gary McKinnon on the network at all. 
What happened to him now is unknown, maybe he is underground.
The last time he was interviewed in the British media was in 2016, where he admitted that Theresa May’s decision to cancel his extradition to the United States essentially saved his life.",What are your thoughts on Gary McKinnon

For all, we know these sightings might be secret USA tech or a foreign country tech. And we might still not have the answer to ""are we alone in the universe?"". After all, this is done.

How is the world going to (or WOULD) react to aliens being real? Do you guys think it's kind of weird in a way though?

It's like this UAP thing is not major mainstream news or something.

I'm not going to lie here. This whole finding out what UAPs really are thing has been a blast and fun in all. But to be honest this whole journey has been anti-climatic because of the lack of interest from our society. There was no hype or build-up before disclosure man. Like a new years countdown without the countdown.

In conclusion, if aliens would be confirmed to be real by the Government. Would this lack of hype, interest, and build-up show that society wouldn't care about aliens being real?

We draw/paint/create superheroes, aliens, monsters, fantasy creatures, from our imagination.. What's not to say those ancient civilizations weren't just doing the same? 

Maybe all these artefacts and paintings are simply people's creations, their imagination, they just didn't have paper and pencil like us so they used what materials they had. Just because they sculpted/drew/depicted characters and beings that were non human, doesn't mean they were drawing them because that's what they saw and were visited by, they could have simply just been doing art and using their imagination and creating their own characters and comics and superheroes and creatures, just like we do now

Why do we dismiss or ignore the fact that these cave paintings etc could have just been art, people's ideas and imagination. I 100000% believe the nazca lines, pumu punku, gobelki tepe, etc are proof that something/someone more intelligent and technologically advanced, maybe already on this planet, maybe from another planet or maybe it was made by the same God/being that created everything else, but some drawings of funny looking men, fantasy creatures and the idea of vehicles does not prove we were visited by aliens, it proves that the ancients civilisations were imaginative, good artists and had good ideas but that's about it...

If we found a marvel comic from 10000 years ago, we would instantly believe ""oh these ancient civilisations drew flying men and women with super powers and flying spaceships and rockets, they must have definitely have been visited by these God's/Aliens as depicted in this book. These comic book stories are proof and evidence of the conversations the civilisations had with these God's, you can see this human talking to what they called, ""The Batman"" "" WHYYYY?? Maybe these cave paintings and sculptures and things are just people from the ancient civilizations that were just an ancient day Stan Lee.. 

If I go and spray paint a non human looking dude on a wall, does that mean I spray painted it because thats what I actually saw, or because that was in my imagination?

I won’t go into too much detail here but rather provide a really brief description of how to do your own CE5. I will also attach some suggestions and links that hopefully you will find useful.

So here is my easy way to do CE5 (human initiated extra terrestrial contact):

1. Get together with some open minded friends or join a CE5 Facebook or other social media group. There are lots of them and people have been doing this for a long time. Don’t pay someone like Greer and don’t pay for his apps or anything else. This should be free

2. Go away from city lights, ideally somewhere in the country where you can see a lot of stars very clearly. No need to be super serious about it, just have an open heart and an open mind. Take a torch and a laser pointer if these are legal in your jurisdiction. Don’t ever point the laser at the object rather draw a circle around it.

3. Sit in a circle and either meditate, visualise or even just talk out loud. Either visualise your location and make it known you would really like to see something. People report all sorts of phenomena - moving lights or objects in the sky, orbs, shimmering forms, or flashing lights. 

4. You may mistake planes or satellites for actual UFOs. This happens to everyone. So maybe you just saw a high flying plane. It is helpful to see if your area is under a flight path and also there are apps which show satellite positions. Try and exclude this by using actual evidence from the apps.

5. Be patient. Usually in my experience they tend to show up pretty soon after the meditation/ visualisation and they put on a bit of a show. It can make you feel like a little kid watching fireworks for the first time. A common thing that CE5 groups do is ask the craft to “power up”. I will attach some videos of events to show you.

That’s it. I am not here to convince anyone of what is real or not. What I am saying is that myself and many others have been doing this for a while. It seems that the more you do it, the more often they appear. I never believed in any of this just a few years ago and now I have zero doubts. I have taken out skeptical friends and they have seen things and now they see them regularly, even in daylight. There are tons of videos in the various CE5 Facebook groups posted everyday. 

I am not a fan of Greer but he has probably done more than anyone to get this information out there so props to him for that. Here are some links to websites which I think are better and they have good information and good videos. Best wishes to everyone and enjoy it!

aliens,"# Note: Below is also a shoutout to the author of Berserk, Kentaro Miura, who just passed away. May he rest in peace, and may the alien Gods make him transcend above the godhand.

The reason for the ""demon"" attribution made by the DoD is because it undercuts the cosmological framework of certain religions with the beliefs with a dichotomy of ""everything is either God or demons"" and the contradiction between the vast cosmic scale and their hyperfocus on a small subset of one species as being somehow superior, and everything else in the entire universe being a backdrop for that species. So, the Abrahamic religions are up on the chopping block for all those reasons, if aliens or something that could only be described as alien to our understanding turn out to be real and they're not just angels and demons.

Other religious sentiments, or a lack of religion, are far more flexible, because they either assume their deity/deities are localized/limited in some capacity so there are more facets and factions than that dichotomy of ""either god/gods or demons,"" all things are divine/intertwined with the divine so there isn't that dynamic of ""either God or demons,"" the deity/deities are fairly hands off, or don't assume deities are real in the first place.

With the belief in an omniscient omnipotent deity who actively meddles and their texts being so limited in worldview, the Abrahamic religions are left in a rather messy spot if aliens turn out to be real. The Abrahamic religions' followers then either have to reinterpret so broadly that I question why they maintain their labels if they've stripped everything away that defines each religious tradition of the religions in that category. Or they have to double down on their beliefs, which seems incredibly arrogant at best in terms of the universe and its scale to me. Or they change their worldviews.

That all being said, the religious I know of those belief systems either don't know about UAP/UFO stuff, are arrogant enough to treat aliens as blank slates to be evangelized to, or think it's demonic. It's unfortunate to say the least. Those calling themselves by those religions still hitch their horses to those texts, even if they themselves are more flexible than than the religions' texts and histories.

And I generally am more willing to comment on the Abrahamic religions as a structure than other systems because, ultimately, the nature of the claims of those systems are treated as universal. If those religions intend to be universal religions, which is likely by virtue of being exclusivist monotheistic systems (""we believe in the One True God and everyone else is mistaken in some way/lying/worshiping demons/etc.""), they need to withstand those outside their contexts discussing them without using religious tolerance as a smokescreen for a lack of critical examination because harder examination makes them uncomfortable.

And this topic brings up a lot of questions that make people uncomfortable. For example, I have serious doubts that aliens would be of the religious sentiments of those belief systems because of all the historical circumstances and cultural stuff that led up to their existence and development and how specific it is to parts of humanity. Let's say aliens land and they don't believe that stuff. I can almost guarantee even many of the more tolerant followers of the Abrahamic religions won't be pleased with that.

Nuance, not everything that is spiritual or interdimensional/extraterrestrial is demonic, and not everything 'demonic' is necessarily Christian-Satanical. And I am 100% certain these beings are interdimensional, but there are physical bodies. It is true that in Christianity it is a black and white dichotomy, Devil or Godly.

Interdimensional beings both good, neutral and bad exist

Others are the regular flesh and blood aliens

Regular 'flesh and blood aliens' might be inhabited by the interdimensional beings.

Maybe not.

Not all aliens are 'flesh and blood', there are literal robot aliens as well, basically Transformers in real life, see the ""[Pascagoula Alien Incident 1975 CTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjlzeYiGLzc)"".

Negative entities can be labelled as the daemons

Benevolent entities are the 'angels'

""Daemon"" is actually a much older form of ""demon"". Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek daimon. Originally in ancient religions daimons were lesser deities. Then Christianity came and ""demonized"" the other gods, so now you know them as the evil spirits from this mythology. –

Angels and demons are the words we are most familiar with when describing paranormal entities of good and evil.

The problem with thinking they're ""demons"" is that it automatically makes them ""evil"". It's a dangerous thought, like much of Christian fundamentalist thinking.

Only by the western standard though. Some Japanese - for instance - believe that yokai have free will like human beings and can choose to be good, and even try to actively help and protect the humans they encounter.

With that said, it's western intelligence and military personnel who are saying they are basically demons from hell. That inherent judgement *is dangerous*.

My take is this, the 'astral world' and its various layers in Kentaro Miura's (Rest in Peace) Japanese manga, *Berserk*, is actually real.

""...a realm in the macrocosmic trinity of Berserk, overlapping the Physical World and Ideal World. It is the plane in which ethereal beings reside – the World of Spirits.\[1\] More precisely, the realm is home to numerous creatures of legend on its surface layers, as well as profound forces of nature near its deeper strata...

At one time, humans were able to keenly perceive and interact with astral entities, even erecting shrines in reverence of certain spirits. However, following the widespread propagation of Holy See doctrine, people began clinging to the ""rigid world"",\[2\] no longer believing in the ethereal and consequently rendered unable to perceive spirits of the Astral World.\[1\]

The Great Roar of the Astral World brings about the merging of the astral and corporeal realms into one global Interstice, with astral creatures of myth taking physical form worldwide as living legends.\[3\]

The Astral World is multi-layered, beginning at a shallow layer, in which creatures of legend reside, and expanding downward into the depths of primordial forces.""

It goes on: [https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Astral\_World](https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_World)

I believe something similar to this is the truth.

Now to go into the DoD side of things.

**Background** Some time ago Lue Elizondo made an interesting statement about religious zealots within the DOD/USG.

&gt;UAP has even been associated with demons and anti-Judeo Christian beliefs.I experienced this first-hand during my time working at the U.S. Government’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), where certain senior government officials thought our collection of facts on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) was dangerous to their philosophical beliefs.In fact, my AATIP predecessor’s career was ruined because of misplaced fear by an elite few. Rather than accept the data as provided by a top-rank rocket scientist, they decided the data was a threat to their belief system and instead, destroyed his career because of it. [source](https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/blog/what-we-know-and-what-we-believe-are-not-always-the-same-thing-heres-how-our-perception-of-fact-influences-our-worldview)

These people are at the top of the food chain when it concerns the National Security of the United States. You are going to tell me that at the top of this food chain, decisions are made based on religious beliefs? Who are these people and can we find them?

**History** At the time of the Roswell incident in 1947 General Nathan F. Twining was the head of the Air Material Command. The Air Material Commands headquarters was located at Wright-Patterson-Air Force Base. Most of us are quite familiar with the [Twining Memo](http://www.nicap.org/twining_letter.htm). Countless of accounts/rumors have been made, that debris from the Roswell crash was stored at Wright-Patterson-AFB. Now, who would be in control of such debris stored at Wright-Patterson? Perhaps the Head of Air Material Commands? Between 1957 and 1960, General Twining was appointed as the Chairman Of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by President Eisenhower. Keep this in mind.

**Present day**A few days ago former Senator Harry Reid made some interesting comments about Lockheed Martin being in possession of ""off-world-debris"":

&gt;**“I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials,” he said. “And I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look at the stuff. They would not approve that. I don’t know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would not give that to me.”** He told me that the Pentagon had not provided a reason. I asked if that was why he’d requested sap status for aatip. He said, “Yeah, that’s why I wanted them to take a look at it. But they wouldn’t give me the clearance.” **(A representative of Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this article.)**

***April 30, 2021:*** **THE NEW YORKER Magazine,** [How the Pentagon Started Taking U.F.O.s Seriously](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously?utm_source=nl&amp;utm_brand=tny&amp;utm_mailing=TNY_Daily_050121&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bxid=5eefc834601cbb3382165c8f&amp;cndid=61467554&amp;hasha=8886fde1958db5b0503d40bf26c46a5c&amp;hashb=76e55cae4166457ab74f15da6977ded3a22e1771&amp;hashc=5e0615e8fd6e56aae1f0f4a8e48030374e4f9b6f86a1b5e63fe3405696321963&amp;esrc=Auto_Subs&amp;mbid=CRMNYR012019&amp;utm_term=TNY_Daily)

Just for the fun of it, I decided to take a look at what interesting information I would be able to find on Lockheed Martin's website. At first I took a look at the [board of directors of Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/leadership-governance/board-of-directors.html). Immediately I noticed a few interesting things. The board of directors of Lockheed Martin is made up of the Top Military/USG brass of the US:

* Joseph F. Dunford Jr., Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
* James O. Ellis Jr., Admiral and Commander, US Strategic Command.
* Jeh C. Johnson, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Defense, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of the Air Force.

As you can see these are not your regular government employees. However, the name [Bruce A. Carlson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_A._Carlson)**,** stood out from the rest.

\*\*Who is Air Force General Bruce A. Carlson?\*\*Let's take a look at his career background:

* Former head of the NRO (National Reconnaissance Agency)
* Former Commander of the Air Force Material Command at Wright-Patterson AFB.
* Commander of the 49th wing at Holloman AFB . (F-117 stealth Fighters).
* Commander of the 8th Air Force (B2 stealth bombers and B-52 bombers).
* Commander, 8th Air Force, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, and Joint Functional Component Commander for Space and Global Strike, U.S. Strategic Command, Offutt AFB, Nebras
* Director of Operational Requirements, Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C.
* Director of Advanced Programs, Headquarters TAC, Langley AFB, Virginia

These are just some examples of this Generals impressive career. This is only the unclassified stuff that we are aware of. Just like General Nathan Twining did, he headed the Air Force Material command at Wright-Patterson AFB. General Carlson was involved in the absolute pinnacle advanced US's technological achievements and assets (e.g. development of NRO satellites, F-117 and B2).

In 2009 General Carlson was appointed as head of the National Reconnaissance Agency by President Obama. At that time [Robert Gates](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/n9vyzr/fmr_sec_of_defense_robert_gates_on_ufos_with_all/gxq7wok/) was Secretary of defense. It seems logical/plausible that Robert Gates would have had a hand in the appointment of General Carlson.

\*\*UFO's?\*\*What is also notable, is that General Carlson served at many places, which are well known within the UFO community. Holloman AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, Nellis etc. This by itself is no evidence that he had anything to do with the subject. However the positions, the clearances he held and the technologies he worked with, would make him a prime candidate/suspect, to be in-the-know. If anyone would know anything about UFOs or UFO debris, my best guess is it would be this General. It's no coincidence that this General is now on the board of Lockheed Martin.

**Religion**General Carlson is quite religious. [He doesn't make a secret out of this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_A._Carlson). There's even a youtube upload, named ""[When the Lord Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c_aS_aThiM)"", you can watch of him preaching.

Once you start to look at the whole situation from a 3th person perspective, you have the ingredient for kind of a crazy picture:

* A four star USAF General.
* Who has worked with the US most advanced technologies.
* Who worked at well known ""UFO"" related places.
* Who headed the NRO between 2009 and 2012.
* Who is extremely religious.
* Who is now part of the board of directors of Lockheed Martin (accused of being in possession of ufo debris).

What is also interesting is that Robert Gates has also been in some [religious hot water](https://www.opednews.com/articles/genera_jason_le_070921_pentagon_sued_over_m.htm), while he was Secretary of defense (2006-2011). The AATIP program started in 2007. While both Carlson and Gates where in some key positions within the DOD/USG.

**The icing on the cake** Just around the time that AATIP started the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [General Peter Pace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pace), was fired from his position, due to religious issues. General Pace is somewhat of a ""religious man"", [Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff says he depends on God daily](https://web.archive.org/web/20070611230213/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=19633). Former Senator Harry Reid appeared to have had a hand in the [firing](https://www.foxnews.com/story/outgoing-joint-chiefs-of-staff-chairman-pace-refused-to-voluntarily-retire) of the General Pace. We all know that Senator Reid also had a hand in creating AATIP.

**Summary** General Carlson, Robert Gates (former CIA director), General Pace and Senator Reid. All of these men held key positions, regarding the National Security interests of the United States, around the time AATIP was started. Some of these men were extremely religious, and made no secret out of it. Are these some of the religious zeolites, Lue Elizondo was alluding to? Probably there are still some of them preaching, in high ranking positions within the DOD/USG.

Now what could have possibly gone wrong.........?

In the ""Final Events"" by Nick Redfern, he says UAPs are demons/fallen angels.

\&gt;&gt;zoro aster and the academicbiblical post(s)

However, I don't think Redfern goes far enough in deconstructing the proposed ""solution"" allegedly offered by Collins Elite members: to promote widespread belief in Christianity as a defense against this enemy. Essentially, they think that a theocracy will solve the problem. However, I think this relies on bad logic, whether the result of poor thinking or serving a deliberate disinformation purpose in line with the beliefs outlined in books like Jeff Sharlet's  ""[The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family:_The_Secret_Fundamentalism_at_the_Heart_of_American_Power)"" &lt;&lt;click\*, and ""C-Street"". 

On the one hand, I don't believe it's true because Christianity as widely believed simply is not true. What I am about to say is well known among Biblical historians and those who have studied Ancient Near East Studies. This is also why I do not believe in the Law of One Material, as it assumes Jesus did these miracles based on the Bible, but this only goes to show the already preconceived notions held by the people that wrote the law of one, they understood that many people regarded Jesus as a miracle worker so went along with it without any critical thinking, as to make the story more palatable to impressionable Westerners.  

 This idea is more fully developed in another book, Laura Knight-Jadczyk's  [High Strangeness: Hyperdimensions and the Process of Alien Abduction](https://www.amazon.ca/High-Strangeness-Hyperdimensions-and-the-Process-of-Alien-Abduction/dp/1897244436/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8) . If you read Final Events, do check out that one, too, as it places a LOT of the material Redfern presents in a wider context. For example, it explains the link between psi and UFOs, on which the Collins Elite so focused its attention. It provides a framework for understanding the proposed connection between the ""occult realm"" of the UFOs/aliens/daemons/demons and the ""afterlife realm"", i.e., hyperdimensions, the connection between abductions and OBEs, and more. And it makes clear that in addition to the deceptions pointed out by Redfern, there are also **religious deceptions at play: even the very idea that ""Christianity will save us.""**

So allow me to put in a little arm work and do what Redfern failed to do, that is, prioritizing critical thinking in order to deconstruct the proposed ""solution"" of mass acceptance of Christian religion, which he says is the answer to UFO demons.

There are absolutely no records of Jesus' miracles from the time he was alive, again, I repeat, there are **no contemporary reports** of any of Jesus' miracles from the time he lived. There are reports decades after, but this is easily expected as Christian converts wrote about their beliefs. But let me tell you why this is a critical problem, the Bible clearly says that ""Jesus was known throughout the land"" as a miracle worker, and even then when Christians say, ""But Jesus always told people who witnessed his miracles to not tell anyone about them, to keep it quiet"", there is a fundamental problem. Each time Jesus told people to not say anything about his miracles, they all went and told everyone about it. 

 ""And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him, 'See that you say nothing to anyone'.. But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter "" (Mark 1:43-45).

  ""And He \[Jesus after the miracle\] instructed them that they should tell no one. But the more he told them not to, they proclaimed *it even* more abundantly"" (Mark 7:36).

It goes on, but you see my point. The excuse that ""there shouldn't be any contemporary records of Jesus' miracles from the time he lived should be expected"" does not fly, due to this internal critique. Just employing logical thinking here.

During that period of time, there was a long list of Jewish apocalyptic magicians and rabbis, many who were just like Jesus, as in, they also preached of an imminent destruction of the world and were said to be miracle workers/magicians. Hence, why Jesus said, ""Truly I tell you, some who are standing here *will not taste death* before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom"" (Mat. 16:28), which of course is referring  to the judgement day happening in the generation of those living at the time. There are many, many such places in the Bible where Jesus states that he would return (second coming) in that specific generation for judgement. I'll give you links at the bottom of this post if you are interested in what historians say about who Jesus was. 

Jesus falsely prophesied about the end of the world/judgement day happening in *his own generation.* It never happened, and people 2000 years later are still waiting for it to happen, but it never will because it never did. The prophecy that many believe came from Jesus, was wrong. But Jesus was not the only one, there were actually many failed apocalyptic rabbis during that time who taught that they would usher in the end of the world in that specific generation. Jesus is simply the one you are most familiar with.

 According to the gospels, Christ healed diseases, cast out devils, rebuked the sea, cured the blind, fed multitudes with five loaves and two fishes, walked on the sea, cursed a fig tree, turned water into wine and raised the dead.

 There are no records of this.

How is it possible to substantiate these miracles?  
The Jews, among whom they were said to have been performed, did not believe them. The diseased, the palsied, the leprous, the blind who were cured, did not become followers of Christ. Those that were raised from the dead were never heard of again. They felt being resurrected from the dead was so insignificant that they nor their loved ones left any written record of the event.

  
Can we believe that Christ raised the dead?  
A widow living in Nain is following the body of her son to the tomb. The Bible says Christ halts the funeral procession and raises the young man from the dead and gives him back to the arms of his mother.  
This young man disappears. He is never heard of again. No one takes the slightest interest in the man who returned from the realm of death. Luke is the only one who tells the story. Maybe Matthew, Mark and John never heard of it, or did not believe it and so failed to record it.  
John says that Lazarus was raised from the dead.  
It was more wonderful than the raising of the widow’s son. He had not been laid in the tomb for days. He was only on his way to the grave, but Lazarus was actually dead. He had begun to decay.  
Lazarus did not excite the least interest. No one asked him about the other world. No one inquired of him about their dead friends.

  
When he died the second time no one said: “He is not afraid. He has traveled that road twice and knows just where he is going.”  
As a former Christian, I did not believe in the miracles of Mohammed, and yet they are as well attested as this. We have no confidence in the miracles performed by Joseph Smith, and yet the evidence is far greater, far better.  
If a man should go about now pretending to raise the dead, pretending to cast out devils, we would regard him as insane. What, then, can we say of Christ? If we wish to save his reputation we are compelled to say that he never pretended to raise the dead; that he never claimed to have cast out devils.  
We must take the ground that these ignorant and impossible things were invented by zealous disciples, who sought to deify their leader. In those ignorant days these falsehoods added to the fame of Christ. But now they put his character in peril and belittle the authors of the gospels.  
Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith. If that religion be true, there is but one savior, one inspired book, and but one little narrow grass-grown path that leads to heaven.  
Why did he not again enter the temple and end the old dispute with demonstration? Why did he not confront the Roman soldiers who had taken money to falsely swear that his body had been stolen by his friends? Why did he not make another triumphal entry into Jerusalem? Why did he not say to the multitude: “Here are the wounds in my feet, and in my hands, and in my side. I am the one you endeavored to kill, but death is my slave”? Simply because the resurrection is a myth. The miracle of the resurrection I do not and cannot believe.

The Bible tells us that when Jesus died, there was a mass resurrection as well. Many people fail to realize that the New Testament Bible actually talks about 2 resurrections.

The Bible says that after Jesus' resurrection the bodies of many holy people were raised from the dead. There still exist at least some of the works of more than 60 historians or chroniclers who lived in the period, yet no mention of this. It never happened, and the Bible has given yet another false history

[**Matthew 27:51-53**](http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/niv/matthew/27/)**:**

&gt;**51** At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split **52** and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. **53** They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection **and went into the holy city and appeared to many people**.

Again, [absolutely no record](https://www.reddit.com/r/exReformed/comments/lfj8tl/the_bible_says_that_after_jesus_resurrection_the/).

The Bible tells us that the Roman gaurds saw the Tomb stone being rolled away. Absolutely no record.

The Bible tells us that when Jesus died, the temple veil was torn asunder from top to bottom, again, no record. 

Would you expect that of the omnipotent God, and giver of the Holy Bible?

We know nothing certainly of Jesus Christ. We know nothing of his infancy, nothing of his youth, and we are not sure that such a person ever existed.  
There was in all probability such a man as Jesus Christ. He may have lived in Jerusalem. He may have been crucified; but that he was the Son of God, or that he was raised from the dead, and ascended bodily to heaven, has never been, and, in the nature of things, can never be, substantiated.

But barring the research of biblical scholars, there's another reason. The Collins Elite's reasoning seems to go as follows: aliens are not ETs; they more resemble accounts of demons; therefore Christianity is true. The premises don't lead to the conclusion. Rather, it could be that demonology gave some accurate descriptions of a phenomenon that was insufficiently understood and placed within a false framework, i.e., Christianity, with all its numerous other beliefs which have been falsified or proven to be historically inaccurate accounts. In other words: Aliens may or may not be ETs, but they are not necessarily ""demons"" per se, either (at least not according to strict Christian interpretation). Rather, aliens have at various times been described as Yokai, Daemons, Demons, ETs, Fairies, Djinn, etc. 

Even if the demon angle may be closer than the ET or space brother idea -- and they really ARE evil -- again, it's just not in the Christian framework. I know to those who cannot look beyond their religion have a hard time understanding this, for them, that particular religion they believe is the truth, despite what scholars say.

But I disagree with those who believe they are all evil. I disagree with those who label everything they don't want to truly understand as being the devil. It is very hard for people who see things in life as a dichotomy of ""black and white"", ""God or Satan"", ""Good or evil"" to understand nuance. To understand something like Ying and Yang. 

This is why I do not believe ETs are [evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k7apthstus&amp;ab_channel=UnidentifiedAerialPhenomena).

Judging from a lot of the comments on this sub, I realize most people here believe these are demons/Christian satans. I do not, yet I believe in the spiritual/astral world and that the aliens are interdimensional in nature. Does that surprise you? I would even affirm that many of the inhabitants of the astral world are negative entities, demonic. But I also know that there are positive entities. For every 300-500 negative entities, there is one good entity. Frightening, yes, but they're there as well.

I also believe in Lue Elizondo, why? Because Elizondo, though he has made it clear numerous times during his interviews that he has it out for Dr. Steven Greer, just as Greer has it out for Elizondo, Elizondo actually ended up giving credence to Greer's claims about the government's top dogs being Christian Bible Fundamentalists. Don't know what I'm talking about? See:  [When disclosure serves secrecy. : aliens (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/mzlxsg/when_disclosure_serves_secrecy/)  

In that write up by Greer, he talks about exactly this, that the government is run by Christian fundamentalists who are trying to bring Jesus back. Unfortunately for them they have no understanding of Biblical history, they don't know that Jesus promised to come back (second coming) in the generation which he directly talked to. Yet billions are still waiting for his arrival, and Greer says the government believes the aliens are part of the last battle of Judgement day, before Jesus arrives.

Elizondo, though he has made it clear he very much dislikes Greer, has affirmed Greer's legitimacy in my eyes, by saying that the government is in fact run by Christians. This also affirms Elizondo's legitimacy even more in my eyes, as it takes courage to affirm something you know is true, and morally right, but also something which, if you say, also affirms someone who opposes you, and to you is a 'false messenger' (Steven Greer, in the eyes of Elizondo, and vice versa). This takes back bone to do, and is done for the pure sake of truth, regardless of what may come. 

This also ruins the common Christian narrative which stems from a constant persecution complex, that is, the government or 'illuminati' are all devil worshiping Christ-rejecters.

**Theological reasons why I do not believe aliens are Bible-Satanical.**

 Basically, being a person who was in Christian ministry for a long period of their life, I used Reddit's platform to bounce around observations I've made while reading the Holy Bible. These are things that my pastor has never talked about, and are things C.S. Lewis never talked about. My belief, again, this is just me, is that even if the aliens are demonic in some nature, their capacity for evil is nothing compared to the actual God who claims to be righteous and holy in the religious book itself. The reason we are focusing on the Bible is because the DoD is also focusing upon the Bible, they are approaching this topic from a Christian lens. So I thought I'd do the same. 

Here are some observations I've made:

&amp;#x200B;

1. God brainwashes parents into murdering and then cannibalizing their own children: [The Biblical God has the same morality as Jeffrey Dahmer who was a serial killer, rapist and cannibal. The Christian argument for free will is in no way moral or acceptable. : atheism (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ijy840/the_biblical_god_has_the_same_morality_as_jeffrey/)
2. God has children sacrificed alive in fire (This is the overwhelming academic consensus among Hebrew scholars): [Did you know that in the Bible God had children sacrificed in fire, then lied about it, and became egregiously offended when men desired to ask him why he gave laws for child sacrifice in fire.

aliens,"Setting all video, picture, hieroglyphics from all around the world and history aside, I want to talk about the possibility in just the Milky Way solar system alone. With the estimated 6Billion earth like planets in the Milky Way who is to say we are the only one inhabited by intelligent life. That’s just earth like planets. Scientists and other very smart people may say it is impossible for one reason or another when in fact there is no way to know. I hear the argument of life being carbon based. Everything we know about the universe are mainly just from laws of physics we have on our planet. Who is to say they it’s completely different in other galaxies. In the event that we are visited and our leaders are in communication we as a species being violent full of hate over emotional would never get along with aliens. I think it would be cool if we co existed like in Star Trek but it would never happen. Since we are quick to react to situations, say a large craft full of aliens were to land and honestly be here to help and have 0 bad intentions large numbers of people would react in a way that wouldn’t do anyone any good and it only takes one person to do something malaise to make them angry",I need opinions
aliens,,The UAP in this video is doing pretty much exactly what David Fravor described!
aliens,"I've been trying to picture what a species could accomplish after millions of years of innovation, look at us for example in the next 20 years it's entirely possible we reach the technological singularity where everything gets out of control and by that I mean we could literally have major breakthroughs in every field of science almost every day if we manage to create a super intelligent AI, that's just 20 years away according to most experts and it could happen sooner than that, now that's a few decades of human innovation at our current understanding of things and we can barely leave the planet, imagine the leaps that a species would have if they were just a thousand years ahead of us.

Its a given they are way more intelligent than we are so following that logic anything you could think of scientifically that's possible they would of already made it, were close to putting neuralink in humans and its at its early stages, a few decades of innovation and we will basically be super human each and everyone of us will have access to all of human knowledge and be able to think about something and just know it.

I just think they are so far ahead of us that they will be able to see our past present and future, they will have nano technology that we wouldn't see, it could be so small and impossible to detect, time would be irrelevant to them, were a few breakthroughs away from making people immortal so they definitely will be immortal themselves.

Now this is where it gets more bizarre because if they wanted to not be seen we would never notice them at all which i find really strange, all we've had are sightings and its possible all they are doing is just observing us but if they wanted to just observe us we wouldn't even encounter them by accident since were talking about beings being way beyond us they would be able to just have nanobots with cameras on for example and see everything they wanted to see without being noticed.

Just wanted to remind everyone to stay sceptical about everything that's happening, we have people on both sides saying these beings are benevolent and people on the other side saying this is a threat, were taking other peoples word for everything when in reality we do not know what we are dealing with here at all, we cannot begin to comprehend what they would want from us.

lets hope they are nothing like us as a species because if it was the other way around and we were the aliens visiting another species do you really think the guys in charge wouldn't be manipulating them, through mind control or propaganda, its very likely that they will have access to our internet and possibly be able to place ideas in peoples heads or objects.

I just wanted to know what other people thought because its mind blowing trying to think what they are capable of, I'm not religious but if the gods are real then they are most likely super advanced beings where some may be good but some also might not be.

Also there's the simulation theory but that's another rabbit hole... anyways thanks for reading, its my first post here, long time lurker, this is more of a thought experiment if anything, i don't necessarily believe in any of this I just want to hear other peoples bizarre theories!","Thoughts on what we could possibly be dealing with, let me hear your crazy theories!"
aliens,,Some odd reflections in the room?
aliens,"&amp;#x200B;

Origins

About 10.75 Millions years ago, thousands of shrapnel of Mars, some the size of entire states, crashed into the Earth, only in its infancy of life. At this time, single-cell organisms, the smallest ever recorded, were just beginning to exist. 

Only a few hundred years later, life evolved faster than ever before. Multicellular life began to evolve into beings visible to the eye. Simple crustaceans grew from these organisms, and they grew into the first boned animals. Small fish, as small as one’s palm. They quickly evolved to the dinosaurs, the birds, the mammals, and then us.

Obviously, this had to be connected with the thousands of shrapnel of Mars. Something was in them. This is a theory thought many times, that life on Earth was boosted by the more evolved organisms of Mars. But we never wondered...why they came.

Disaster

What if, on a placed day *billions* of years ago, when Mars was blooming with multicellular life and Earth, a dormant mirrage of its sister planet. Aliens come, with massive spaceships as large as countries. What do they see? Just bacteria and some other miniscule organisms. They think nothing of it, and leave.

The object that would hit Mars, an object the size of Pluto, the object that sent life to Earth never hits Mars. Because it was caused by the Aliens.

On Mars, the organisms never die from the Object. They keep evolving. After a few million years, they are small animals that have adapted to the harsh radiation and environment of Mars. They continue to evolve. Intelligent beings rise, where they hide underground from the radiation that continues to worsen. They create underground civilizations, with super-advanced technology.

Meanwhile, on Earth, life continues to grow, but it hasn’t been boosted. Instead of 10 million years for land life to develop, it takes 300 million years. The Chicxulub disaster strikes, but there are only small crustaceans and even smaller bacteria, no dinosaurs. So there is no major extinction. After a couple of hundreds of millions of years, the Dinosaurs *do* come. 

The Martians come to Earth, finally with planet-traveling technology. What do they find? Not humans, but dinosaurs. They breed and keep them alive. They have created war animals. The original aliens who did not eradicate life on Mars find a Martian civilization with Dinosaur war birds and technology to rival their own. They fight. An intergalactic war is fought. The og Aliens lose, and the Martian’s influence takes over the territory that was once the OG Alien’s. A new empire is born. *Trillions* die.

Prevention

Earth has become a desolate wasteland. Because the Martians have won and see no use for their war-birds, they destroy Earth’s life to prevent it from becoming a threat. 

Meanwhile, some survivors of the OG Aliens have secretly been advancing. They don’t want another war; they want a timeline where a war never happened.

So they go back in time, and destroy any hope for Mars life to prevent the ensuing conflict. But in the process, they boost life to Earth. And as their timeline ceases to exist, they unknowably create another intelligent species. And there is no galactic Martian empire to stop them from expanding. Only time will tell if they created an even deadlier foe than the Martians.

Now, the OG Aliens come. They see us with their probes. They remember what the ancients told them, about how they must destroy Mar’s life in order to prevent a galactic homicide. They see Earth and connect the dots. They consider its destruction; the “humans,” as they call themselves, do have Martian DNA. But instead, they want to contact them. Make them a fierce ally, and not a sworn enemy. 

This is my tale of how we exist today. 

**Alternate Timeline:**

**1 years before Mars Shrapnel Rendezvous. (YBMS): The OG Aliens come to our Solar System**

**300 Million YAMS: Mars life has become intelligent, Multicellular life develops on Earth**

**900 Million YAMS: Dinosaurs are discovered on Earth, where they are kept as war birds by the Martian Empire**

**1 Billion YAMS: The Martian Empire becomes supreme and life on Earth is destroyed**

**1 Billion 500 Million YAMS: The past changer is developed**

**2 Billion YAMS: The Martian-Empire Timeline ceases to exist.**

**NOW: Is this the Human-Empire Timeline? Will we cease to exist by past users?**",The life Conspiracy

aliens,"I am soon to be divorced and living alone after 13 years. In fact, it will be the first time in my life that I've had to sleep in an empty house night after night. I am worried that without my ex-wife next to me I will have difficulty sleeping. During the few times that she's been away and I did have the bed to myself, I actually slept in the living room with the TV on and didn't sleep very well.

When I was a kid I'd watch shows like Unsolved Mysteries and Sightings. Of all the creepy paranormal stuff I've seen on TV, alien abduction stories spook me out the most. The idea that those darn Greys can jump out of a wall, knock me out, and take me away to do who knows what scares the hell out of me.

Now this fear feels a little more real after watching the recent 60 Minutes show on UAPs. If the government is coming out and validating the presence of what appear to be craft from another world, who's to say there isn't something to all those eerily consistent stories told by victims of alien encounters? It seems that these UAPs can traverse right through different mediums with no resistance, which might be theoretically possible for a vehicle that could bend the fabric of space time dimensions. For a craft with such capability, going through walls to get to people seems plausible to me.

I've never had an alien encounter and I wouldn't want one unless I can know what their intentions are. I hope my fear of them doesn't summon anything, as it seems Stephen Greer does with the CE-5 stuff.

Assuming aliens are real and visiting us, maybe the reason is because we are close to being able to establish colonies on Mars and we are prohibited from doing so. If there is some sort of community outside of Earth I consider it possible that no species is allowed to establish any sort of permanent settlement off their own planet as doing so would preclude the creation of new life and likely lead to conflict. This provides a reasonable explanation for the fermi paradox. 

If our governments were told this it's possible they would cover it up in order to continue funding advancements in rocketry for weapons purposes. While the reported warnings about taking care of our planet are important either way, they're especially important if you consider that we aren't allowed to form settlements elsewhere.",Mars off-limits?

**UFOs and Nukes Extraordinary Encounters at Nuclear Weapons Sites by Robert Hastings:**  

*Page 36;*  
&gt;In short, during the late-1940s and early-1950s, someone seemed to be intent on conducting repeated, unauthorized over-flights of the U.S. government's top secret atomic weapons sites.  Reliable eye-witnesses accounts indicated that the aerial craft involved in these incursions were revolutionary in design—usually disc-shaped, but sometimes reported as spherical, cigar-shaped, or diamond-shaped—and vastly superior in performance to any known jet aircraft or rocket. 

*Page 46;*  
&gt;February 17, 1949. A fireball and a UFO were observed on the same day. Kirtland AFB OSI Special Agent Captain Melvin E. Neef reported that a fireball, orangered in color with a ""gas flame"" blue tail, was visible for 5-7 seconds at Sandia Base at 5:52 a.m. That evening, a bright ""yellow-orange cigar-shaped light"" was observed by approximately 100 people, including Sandia's military security guards, for seven minutes, between 5:59 and 6:06 p.m.^^(28)  

*Page 79;*  
&gt;Foss continued, ""To the best of my recollection, the Las Vegas newspapers printed numerous reports of UFO sightings during the Operation Teapot tests.  One evening between shots, I drove into Las
Vegas for groceries and, on my return to Indian Springs AFB, I observed what I thought was a UFO. It was not the traditional disc-shaped UFO but a cigar-shaped object which was emitting different colors, such as red and orange, as it traveled in the night sky. The UFO was closer to the base than to Las Vegas. There was no reflective glow in the sky from the city, so it was dark and the object stood out clearly as it headed towards the test range. This object was initially moving in a straight line but then made a few erratic moves that no Air Force plane at the time could possibly
perform.  Then it was gone.""  

*Page 118;*  
&gt;Harris states that five or six of these gun-camera clips were presented, spliced together one after the other, for the next 20 to 30 minutes. Some of the intercept attempts were filmed in color, with the remainder in black-and-white. ""Several [UFO] shapes could be seen,"" he said, ""one was saucer-shaped with a dome on top; another one was cigar-shaped with port holes; and some looked like a cloud, maybe because they were embedded in a plasma field. Some of the film segments were very jerky due to the pursing aircraft attempting to stay with the UFO."" Throughout, there was no narration or soundtrack of any kind. Harris told me that one ""could have heard a pin drop"" in the theater, as the squadron's members watched in stunned silence.  

*Page 154;*  
&gt;There are, in fact, a relative handful of UFO sighting cases which suggest a two-tier specialization of function. Although rare, these well-documented sightings involved enormous, cigar-shaped objects, frequently referred to as ""motherships"", releasing and retrieving much smaller disc-shaped craft.
One such sighting was reported on August 23, 1954, near Vernon, France. Among the witnesses were two local policemen and an army engineer, who described seeing in the sky a huge, silent, perfectly stationary cigar-shaped object standing on end. A fourth witness, businessman M. Bernard Miserey, stated, ""I had been watching this amazing spectacle for a couple of minutes when suddenly from the bottom of the cigar came an object like a horizontal disk, which dropped at first in free fall, then slowed, and suddenly swayed and dived horizontally across the river toward me, becoming very luminous. For a very short time I could see the disk full-face.""  

*Page 155;*  
&gt;Another such case has been reported by researcher Raymond Fowler, involving residents of Ipswich, Massachusetts, who reported witnessing a nearly identical display just offshore on September 17, 1966. However, in that sighting, several discs emerged from the top of the cigar-shaped object, as it hung motionless over the ocean.  A third report of this type occurred on September 8, 1958, near Offutt AFB, Nebraska—Strategic Air Command Headquarters—and was observed by at least 25 Air Force personnel, including Major Paul A. Duich, who wrote, ""...as we watched, there appeared at the lower end of the [pencil or slender cigar-shaped] object a swarm of black specks cavorting every which way, much like a swarm of gnats. This procedure continued for a minute or so before [the specks] disappeared. Then the object, which had hung motionless on the same spot, slowly changed attitude from an upright position to a 45-degree angle with the horizontal and started moving slowly toward the west..."" | Regarding the last sighting, given the other reports of this kind of UFO activity, it can reasonably be argued that, had the cigar-shaped object been closer to the observers, the specks would have appeared disc-shaped. Of course, this cannot be said with certainty.  

*Page 268;*  
&gt;Austad then said that while the UFO he had tracked at SAGE was certainly startling, he had once been involved in another, truly astonishing incident. ""I don't remember the exact year that this occurred,"" he said, ""but one time, when I worked at the [FAA Air Traffic Control] Center in Salt Lake, we got a phone call from a radio station in Burley, Idaho.  
People had been calling them to report a huge cigar-shaped vehicle in the sky, about 60 to 70 miles north of Burley. So I called Hill AFB to tell them about it, and they scrambled an F-80. A little while later, the pilot radioed the base and said, 'Well, this thing is up there, big as life, and 21 disc-shaped craft just came out of it!' About ten minutes later, he came back on and said, 'I'm at [my operational ceiling], but this thing is still far above me—at around 80,000 feet.' That was probably the most spectacular incident that I remember.""   
Perhaps significantly, if the huge cigar-shaped UFO was located some 70 miles north of Burley when it released the discs, it would have been less than 30 miles west of the National Reactor Testing Station. Established in 1949, under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission, the NRTS was for many years the site of the largest concentration of nuclear reactors in the world. Over time, 52 were built and operated there, including the U.S. Navy's first prototype submarine reactor. 

*Page 416;*  
&gt;When I sent Burris' sighting report to Col. Halt, more unexpected information emerged. He responded, ""I know of another sighting at Woodbridge on Guy Fawkes Night (November 5th) in 1981.  Two  independent [security] police patrols saw a large cigar-shaped object float in from the sea and silently loop around the Woodbridge tower.  Neither reported it and I only found out by chance as they were leaving for a new assignment.""  

*Page 435;*  
&gt;The sighting was investigated by Dr. S.P. Kuzionov, of Leningrad's Geographical Society, and involved five witnesses, including missile technician Shamil Yuaihmetov, who reported seeing a metallic-appearing, cigar-shaped object slowly descending at a 45-degree angle. As it did so, it emitted a hissing sound. The sighting occurred at 11:45 p.m. but the exact date in October 1984 was not mentioned in Kuzionov s report.

*Page 54;*  
&gt;Turning back to the old reports, I skipped through until I found the American sightings. One of the first was an incident at Bonham, Texas, in the summer of 1873.  
It was broad daylight when a strange, fast-moving object appeared in the sky, southwest of the town.  For a moment, the people of Bonham stared at the thing, not believing their eyes.  The only flying device then known was the drifting balloon. But this thing was tremendous, and speeding so fast its outlines were almost a blur.  Terrified farmers dived under their wagons.  Towns-people  fled indoors. Only a few hardy souls remained in the streets.   
The mysterious object circled Bonham twice, then raced off to the east and vanished. Descriptions of the strange machine varied from round or oval to cigar- shaped. (The details of the Bonham sighting were later confirmed for me by Frank Edwards, Mutual network  newscaster, who investigated this case.) Twenty-four hours after the Bonham incident, a device of the same description appeared at Fort Scott, Kansas. Panic-stricken soldiers fled the parade ground as the thing flashed overhead. In a few seconds it disappeared, circling toward the north.  

Page 68;  

&gt;On July 2, 1907, a mysterious explosion occurred in the heavens near Burlington, Vermont. Some witnesses described a strange, torpedo-shaped device circling above. Shortly after it was seen, a round, luminous object flashed down from the sky, then exploded (Weather Review, 1907, page 310).  Another cigar-shaped craft was reported at a low altitude over Bridgewater, Massachusetts, in 1908. Like the one at Sisterville, it carried searchlights, which swept back and forth across the countryside. After a few moments, the visitor rose in a steep climb, and the searchlights blinked out.  
There was no report for 1909 in America, though an odd aerial object was sighted near the Galapagos Islands. But in 1910, one January morning, a large silvery cigar- shaped device startled Chattanooga. After about five minutes, the thing sped away, appearing over Huntsville, Alabama, shortly afterward. It made a second appearance over Chattanooga the next day, then headed east and was never seen again.  

Page 76;  

&gt;It was a bright, moonlit night, with scattered clouds overhead.  
The DC-3 was twenty miles west of Montgomery, at 2:45 AM., when a brilliant projectile-like craft came hurtling along the airway.  Chiles saw it first and took it to be a jet plane. But the next instant both pilots saw that this was no jet fighter.  “It was heading southwest,” Chiles said later, “exactly opposite to our course. Whatever it was, it flashed down toward us at terrific speed. We veered to the left.  It veered sharply. too, and passed us about seven hundred feet to the right.   I saw then that it had no wings.”  The mystery ship passed on Whitted’s side, and he a fairly close look. “The thing was about one hundred feet long, cigar shaped and wingless,” he described it. “It was about twice the diameter of a B-29, with no protruding fins.”  

*Page 96;*  
&gt;In addition, the services of rocket experts, guided-missile authorities, space-travel planners, and others (in the defense services or assigned to them) were made available as desired. Under the heading “How Incidents Are Investigated,” the Project “Saucer” report says:  

&gt;*But the hoaxes and crank letters in reality play a small part in Project “Saucer.”  
Actually, it is a serious, scientific business of constant investigation, analysis and evaluation which thus far has yielded evidence pointing to the conclusion that much of the saucer scare is no scare at all, but can be attributed to astronomical phenomena, to conventional aerial objects, to hallucinations and to mass psychology.  But the mere existence of some yet unidentified flying objects necessitates a constant vigilance on the part of Project “Saucer” personnel and the civilian population.   
Investigation is greatly stepped up when observers report incidents as soon as possible to the nearest military installation or to Headquarters, A.M.C., direct.  
A standard questionnaire is filled out under the guidance of interrogators. In each case, time, location, size and shape of object, approximate altitude, speed, maneuvers, color, length of time in sight, sound, etc., are carefully noted.  This information is sent in its entirety, together with any fragments, soil photographs, drawings, etc., to Headquarters,  A.M.C.  
Here, highly trained evaluation teams take over.  The information is broken down and filed on summary sheets, plotted on maps and graphs and integrated with the rest of the material, giving an easily comprehended over-all picture.  
Duplicate copies on each incident arc sent to other investigating agencies, including technical labs within the Air Materiel Command. These are studied in relation to many factors such as guided missile research activity, weather, and many others, atmospheric sounding balloon launchings, commercial and military aircraft flights, flights of migratory birds and a myriad of other considerations which might furnish explanations.  
Generally, the flying objects are divided into four groups:  
Flying disks, torpedo or cigar-shaped bodies with no wings or fins visible in flight, spherical or balloon-shaped objects and balls of light. The first three groups are capable of flight by aerodynamic or aerostatic means and can be propelled and controlled by methods known to aeronautical engineers.  As for the lights, their actions--unless they were suspended from a higher object or were the product of hallucination--remain unexplained.*

It definitely wasn’t a star and it didn’t fly, it just shined brightly and eventually would disappear. We were always speculating what it could be. Before it stopped appearing, some nights it would get really big and bright, the. Split into multiple other lights. There would be three or four hovering lights in the sky before they’d disappear.

So I'm in a dream, on the edge of a lake.

No mountains around me, it's quite a flat landscape. The grass and the banks seem luxurious, like a beautiful grass carpet.

There's a small island in-front of me, like it's part of the land mass but it's been broken by the small channel in front of me. The break in land is only a meter wide.

I'm standing on the bank behind the separated island.

My understanding of what's about to happen is that it's 'folk' from another place.

The water rises, a bulge appears...in the water. Then there's like a swirling sphere of water, like you can exist in it or travel in it. No one is in it. It's like someone showing off.

The sphere stays formed and begins to travel in the water with the water that it's made of swirling forward to create motion.

At this point I'm aware that it's extra terrestrials and I'm exceptionally happy, where I'm jumping up and down on the bank of the lake...like, keep going...keep doing it.

The widespread belief is that over 90% of sightings are able to be explained away, with maybe just another 5% left unexplained...or waiting for some skeptical ""authority"" to come up with a clever new name for, as an example, the recent Navy pilot reports of flying Tic-Tac craft.  I thought about helping the skeptics out a little by offering something I could call ""Pilot Oxygenated Motion Induced Radar Fatigue,"" or something ridiculous like that.  But, Nah, why bother.

So why are we still stuck with a Quack label in this day and age, despite widespread cellphones and high-definition cameras and such?  Nowadays, I could still accept a fair assessment of 50/50 across the board just to cover the bases of opposing opinions, even though I am still personally inclined to believe 70/30 for what is available.  But the vast majority, if not all, of the aforementioned atmospheric conditions don't even come close to explaining a large number of UFO phenomenon captured on video.

Ever since Roswell, the government will have its own interest to keep a lid on things for the sake of national security.  Okay, understood, I get it. That just leaves Hollywood, which for reasons unknown hasn't really taken these global manifestations seriously.  Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind (1977), despite its huge box office success and 8 Oscar nominations, was the last film to take it seriously, and that was long before the tech we all carry around now to practically flood the ""evidence"" market. Beyond that they only threw a couple little bones (The Fourth Kind; Dark Skies) made with serious undertones and thought provoking scripts, but quickly returned back to comedy (Paul) or the outright silly on SyFy, which just further reinforces the Quack label.

I'm not exactly sure why Hollywood, the biggest medium out there, continues to blockade the narrative of aliens and UFOs.  If anything, they appear to be more inclined to push unrelated narratives of factually unnatural and/or non-existent issues -if not indoctrination- rather than the ""truth"" which has been out there for decades and continuing to accumulate as we speak, in files so many they would overload the Library of Congress if they were all bound in books.

The book details encounter with strange beings throughout history and posit that a lot of folklore beings such as fairies, gnomes, etc are all linked to the same phenomenon as Alien abductions and that whatever this intelligence may be, shapes itself to adhere to the current mindset of the era. The book lists an appendix of encounters with odd entities up until the publication of 1969. Several podcasts I've listened to that bring up abductions or sightings of beings usually occur in the latter half of the 20th century. That made me think, do close encounters of the third kind still occur, or are they no longer reported due to the almost scurrilous nature such reports do to the topic of UAP/UFOs? The most recent CE-3 that I can recall that made waves has been the Aerial School encounter, other than that it seems these instances have all but disappeared?",Do close encounters of the third kind still occur?

aliens,"I believe I had an encounter with several beings as a child, and it was a very negative experience which still gives me chills thinking about it.

However there are several long term effects that I want to see if they are common amongst other people with similar experiences.

List:

Intense curiosity for space and aliens as topics 

Thinking back to the event or reading similar accounts prompts intense feelings of dread and paranoia.

Sense of being watched when alone

Need to sleep facing the nearest entry point

Strong negative feelings towards windows and rooftops

aliens,"At a lab, a scientist injects something into a huge spider; the bug is put into a box with a name on its label, NASA. At ground control for the probe Majestic 12, everything is ready.

I’m a young scientific reporter called Marci Eyre and I had to deal with a couple of so-called freaks obsessed with UFOs. Photographer Slick appears with a photograph of some scientific installations. The male in the couple freaks out and starts speaking Russian in panic. The New-Jersey accented couple are aliens, as I tell her editor Phil. Phil gets rid of the couple pushing them away. I have to take care of local non-interest news. I suspect that federal facility, as there's too much security around it, although it is in the middle of the desert.

I and two friends go there. Meanwhile, there are problems at the spaceship. The astronauts are terrified, screaming and panicking. Little by little, all systems seem to shout down. They switch to automatic. At ground control, Agent Gray the flight control notice that there are like bubbles under the skin of one of the astronauts.

Slick, I and Jake watch the facility with spectacles. Slick scares the other two pretending to be electrified by the fence, but it's only a joke. Phil calls me to tell me off. They break and enter and ravage around the crashing probe, and find a decomposing body. They find one astronaut with half of his face distorted and contorted.

Government officers arrive with scientists. Gray kills one of the scientists who insists that the remaining astronaut has to be taken to hospital, no to the lab. Jacobs throw body bags on top of the hidden reporters, who are trapped inside a locked lorry's cargo. The three friends leave the lorry once inside some underground lab facilities. They find biohazard labels around, and a person's head within a jar. The astronaut tells them ""Mother-In-Law"". He throws up on me, then I lose glasses. A huge spider springs from his mouth.

The spider attacks the two scientists who discover the three amigos. It is as big as somebody's head. As the female scientist can't see because of the spider web, she opens the lab door on her confused way out, giving the spider her way out, not before stinging the male scientist. The spiders runs after the female scientist, catching it, while I hide in a specimen lab. The aggressive spider finds the three reporters. The male scientist rings the alarm. The friends find another NASA astronaut within a cryogenic capsule, which they can open easily.

A spider takes Slick.

It looks like I get into the nest of the spider. It attacks Jake then we go to the project M.I.L room. Then Jake sees he has venom in his knee and he runs to the spider so the spider can kill him and finish him off.

Slick and I enter the elevator but it stops halfway. The elevator seems to be armed, so slick and I leave it and try to climb the walls but fall down until a web catches them halfway to the floor. The spider is human-size now. The spider kills slick while I run away.

Empty corridors all around. The soldiers, including John Murphy looks for me, who runs away. The spiders take some of the soldiers as well. Gray kills a wounded soldier, he's so remorseless. I and John, Gray's assistant, fall to a pool in a warehouse, but a spider attacks John. I save John. He wants to leave the place, but spider webs have it blocked. Gray appears and tells him to stay at gunpoint. Gray wants to silence everybody, so he won't hesitate to kill me and John, the last having no bullets, but a spider traps Gray saving him and me. The spider strings Gray. John is one of the victims.

The only way out has become a nest. A spider appears through the lift floor, but going down, the lift squashes it.

Finally, I and John leave the place through the parking lot and a tunnel.

They run to the newsroom, but Phil has been killed by Gray. He's got one of those spiders' kittens inside him. He wants to save them, a new race of fighting and killing machines. The spider is now as big as a building, creating mayhem on campus.

He can't kill the spider that way, they borrow a helicopter.

I hang from the helicopter with a small bomb. John flies me in front of the spider, who's now on top of a small building. I make it go bust.

aliens,"These viruses look structurally very artificial compared to other viruses and microbes. Also the way they are programmed specifically to alter its hosts genetic code to facilitate production of more phages. Its like these microbes are coded specifically for protection against bacteria. Originating around 4.5 billion years ago I believe they coexisted with multicellular lifeforms protecting the cells during evolution from other harmful bacteria. Maybe these phages were released with primordial genetic soup by our ancestors. I mean its possible , we ourselves have created synthetic microbes. The only thing thats threatening us is that bacteriophage are introducing new genetics of bacteria which are becoming immune to antibiotics.

aliens,,The sky tonight...and something else
aliens,"I listened to Rogan's interview with Travis Walton, and he says that he woke up on the small ufo with the 3 grey aliens.  But then the nordic-man with the glass helmet took his arm and led him off the small ufo onto a base where he saw other spaceships.  Travis could have been in space because he said he couldn't breathe and thought he was dying on the small UFO.  

But what did Travis mean by being on a ""base""?  Was this a base on a planet with a sky and dirt ground?  Or was this a base like the death star that is a huge hangar and stores lots of spaceships?

A death star in space would be a huge construction project and leak air into space.  So, if Travis could breathe he may have been on a earth-like planet?  If Travis was gone for 5 days, it could take 2 days to travel to Zeta Reticuli and 2 days to travel back to Earth.

I don't think its easy to build a spaceship out of 1 piece of metal molding since Travis said the small UFO was made of one piece with no screws.  So it would be impossible to build a full death star out of one piece of metal with no screws.  

Also, do the little grey aliens work for the Nordic-aliens?  It would seem easier for the little grey and little greens to work as scout-slaves sent to explore distant planets and fly fast because the little greens seem to not have any bones or vertibrae, which would help them maneuver 90 degree turns without breaking their bodies.  Maybe the Nordic-aliens are the bosses of the little greens or their is some sort of galactic federation partnering the different alien species.",Was Travis Walton brought into space or a different planet?
aliens,"First, *as an African American* scientist, he is under greater professional pressure than others to tow the line in terms of accepted narrative. For the past seventy years, the narrative which has been enforced on scientists has been that while there might very well be extraterrestrials out there, they are far away, and could never in a million years reach our planet. Were he to openly question that narrative, he would jeopardize his credentials. In this respect he remains a slave to the system. Now, that is a sympathetic perspective; a guess less so might submit that he is simply too proud to change his mind , *especially* if he thinks the people actually in the right are beneath him professionally.

Regarding the crux of the foundations of his argument, it *seems* to be based on two implicit presumptions: 1) the greater the intellect, the colder, more apathetic, and less curious the mind. In his imagination, species more intelligent than us be degrees would be equally less warm, personal, and curious than us. Perhaps he has dogs in mind as an example: they are less intelligent than us, but more affectionate, personable, and curious. 2) Our planet -- our (until recently?) life-friendly, resource-rich, heavily and variously populated planet which has the only moon yet discovered which is exactly far away enough from it to enable its inhabitants to witness perfect lunar eclipses and which happens to be populated by billions of people capable of discerning both the objective numerical equations and subjective beauty of it all -- is *boring* and *uninteresting*, a throw-away world whose investigation would be a misuse of time and energy. 

For my part, I think things like affection, personability, and curiosity are not mutually exclusive to intellect. I also think that of the thousands of planets we have spotted so far, ours remains the one most objectively worthy of anyone's study.",On Neil deGrasse Tyson

But what if it’s not just us they’re interested in, what if it’s the fact our planet is so biodiverse?

I know they’re finding more and more “earth-like” planets out there but we don’t really know if there’s life on there and if there is, how diverse it is.

It would explain why aliens are alleged to be interested in nukes and the environment.

aliens,"I'm not even sure I have the means to put this into words that would do it any due justice but here goes. The last few nights I had been struggling to sleep something was keeping me awake well into the early hours I ended up longing for sleep. Last night after finally falling into a deep sleep I had the a vivid dream like no other this morning with sleep still in my eyes writing this I remember every detail every aspect while still fresh nothing about it has been left broken fogged out or misunderstood. Nothing but clarity. 

It started with a gathering on a wind swept hill that was overlooking a city area a valley below to both my left and right were line upon line of people all gathered together tightly they were not holding hands they were connected by the touch of a hand placed firmly upon the forehead above the eyes of the next person in line and so on and so on. Massed all around us and directly above the city was a huge cloud formation everything about it stood out from the rest of the clouds hanging in the sky I could tell it contained a still hidden extraordinary power within something was anticipating emerging from it bursts of electric and the most intense looking thunder type clouds which were formed all over it constantly erupting over and over again that I have ever seen. The true magnitude of this thing it dwarfed everything exuded an unfathomable sense of power and I remember looking up at it as I am stood with my arm outstretched contacting the person next to me and thought to myself I never gave up, I never stopped believing and I am here because I believed. Then I noticed the frontal parts of gigantic ships began to emerge from all areas of the cloud the electrical bursts wrapping themselves around them as they did the clouds slowly moved away and my god thy were beautiful in design absolutely massive in size yet completely silent in nature.   

Soon after a voice came out of nowhere as if it was hanging in the air directly in front of me with the most calming effect I could imagine it said 'we are not afraid' of course this immediately should have put the fear of god into me but as the voice dictated I as I continued to look upon this cloud and began seeing something emerging from several different points I was no longer afraid of what I was witnessing I knew I had prepared for this all my life and the time was finally here. I felt overwhelmingly peaceful and ultimately prepared for anything. Why the voice said we I do not know but my guess would be that we were always directly connected in some way and implies they are not afraid of our reaction to their final unveiling and we should follow not fear anything that transpires no matter how mind-blowing it may be. 

It was then I began to notice in the far off distance an amazing array of fireworks, fireworks everywhere entirely filling up the skies to the sides of the cloud erupting as if in pure celebration of what was occurring in my middle view, then in another higher area and a crystal clear blue section of the sky looked like what was a fleet of drones formed into what I distinctly recall was formed like a number four hanging high in the sky lights on them began to dance and cascade faster and faster. By this point I was taking in so much visual information I'm entirely unsure how I remember all of it so well the next morning it was as if a preview from some Blockbuster summer movie, all I can say in words it was it was absolutely incredible and dream or not it's an image that will now remain burned into my brain for the rest of my life. I felt like I was truly participating in this coming of celebration still recalling the sense of sweat I felt on my hand from the other persons forehead I was touching which dissipated after the voice came.

I dreamt something incredible but along with that I have no idea what any of it means I am now even more excited at the prospect that something like this will one day occur not only for myself but for each of us. Belief is a powerful thing and something somewhere out there be it near or far is fully aware of just how much we are ready for it to become an immediate reality.

aliens,"So I see a lot of people on her saying that there will be no currency or capitalism of war when we enter some sort of galactic neighborhood. I personally don’t believe this to be true. The universe is full of tons of valuable materials and objects. If the human race is any like the rest of the universes races, I think our future looks more like Futurama. Capitalism and corruption and war still exist but there more opportunities in life. I also believe that ETs know we’re her and have known since before our time. I’m talking early early earth before oceans. We as humans can see other planets in our solar system like titan which seems to be devolving like earth but just a different type of world. It has rain, lakes, volcanos but it’s cold asf. Like liquid water volcanos and methane lakes and rain cold. So back to my theory aliens will undoubtedly have better viewing technologies then we do and could see this from much further away or send probes to verify theory’s. I think they’ve always know and watched as part of their science studies and Phycology economics etc were a really good example of a young civilization.

I also feel like they're as much to blame for the lack of accountability and acknowledgement of their existence as the government is. We all sort of vaguely know of them but have very evidence (if any at all) and feel like we (common humans) are getting the run around. Maybe if people start getting angry not at our stupid governments but at the ""hidden in the shadows"" alien visitors... they might be inclined to get the message that they're not going to be welcomed with open arms when they and the governments decide to be ""honest"" for once.

aliens,"Last year I had a very strange encounter that I don't wish to go into details about. However, through telepathy or ""smartdust?"" I was possibly exposed to a series of unexplained events. I'll give some examples,

I was taken to a ""pod"". There were other pods around me of various people I assume. I was not allowed to leave this pod but instinctly I knew what to do in laying on the table, and seconds later the entire pod went sub zero frozen. Literally like... froze. When I awoke, the glass to the sliding door was foggy from the temp. It tipped like it came off the henges. After that I walked around alittle bit. Brain fog kind of. However some instances I remember is sortof thinking/inclination of being told when we're born, they take our DNA and do other experiments with it, like put it into space, put it through conditions like the speed of light, etc. They don't ""probe"" us but ""scope"" us, and study. Free will doesn't necessisarily exist entirely but consciously we're able to make our own decisions.

In this sense, I saw things on Google space map of locations and other various things that I was either hallucinating or it was really something that was purposely in front of me. One was a document from like 1995 labeling other galactic civilizations and it had like 20 different ones. I always subconsciously thought of things that I never actively wanted to imagine or thought of. Like perhaps the Men In Black movie, Matrix, etc.. movies just come from the ether to us, and we take it in one way but there might be other reasons they come at the times they do. 

These are just some of the experiences I've gone through, I've developed some PTSD over it but also was shown subconsciously how to perceive it and not factor it into anything other than a dream perhaps.. like the brain recieving packets of data/the photons of these projections, it makes me wonder to what extent is something overthinking, to what reality really is. I do believe in the future, humans won't need to even speak to communicate, almost like the early humans perhaps, predictionwise.. I do imagine these types of experiments have happened... and actually there are more things I've thought about.

I mean if we consider that some region of space in the universe are ""older"" and some ""younger"" from others by the activity of space itself (star creation, super novae destruction, black holes etc) it would be reasonable to assume some aliens species are older than some others. We could be living in the middle of a vast intergalactic communications system and can't see it yet..it could be all around us in a different format... in the same way that we couldn't understand / see the cosmic microwave background, or gravitational waves, black holes and things like that a few hundred years ago. Also if we live in that ""protected"" region of space it would explain many things like the lack of any proof of advanced aliens species yet, the silence, nothing detected etc in the same way that we protect animals in a zoo.

**2)** Could it be possible too that ""the"" THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe (like the really top) and the oldest, are being of pure""energy"" no more biological, or robotics or things like that.. if they were in front of us would they be indistinguishable from nature to us because they are so advanced ? (e.g imagine Ancients in Stargate) I mean like, immortal beings who knows mostly everything on how the universe work... billions years old civilizations... it would be pointless for them to hurt us in the same way it's pointless for us to kill a ant ? Could theses beings exist and make the others behave or listen ? by being so advance too... do you believe that they have ""no choice"" in being inherently ""good"" because they can destroy everything / anything in ways we can't imagine ? life creation/protection/expansion would be the most essential thing for them ? If we believe in theses multiverse multidimensions theories, do you think theses being could move from a universe/dimension to another ? or even create universe or galaxy themselves ? If we imagine a long road with water on it, it would be reasonable to assume 1 universe is a water hole and some water hole are connected.

**3)** On a final thought... if we see the universe as a ""finite/infinite region of space"" in term of ""space"" like the space you have in your house, could theses being move inside that region of space in ways that we can't imagine yet ? I mean instead of having a spaceship with fuel and a propulsion system with a engine, like a human would think, could they use the ""darkness"" of space I mean space ""itself"" like scientist like to call the ""aether""... as a way to move or teleport from region to region extremely fast or instantly ? play/move with the aether as a wave or tunnel to travel long distance or do others things ? by being energy beings they wouldn't require a spaceship / suits / or whatever they could ""be"" just there ? I mean existing in a space / dimension in a place without requiring anything but themselves. From a very fundamental point of view I believe we can explain the big things from the small things, and the complex things from the easy things. I also believe that from the ""natural progression"" of life itself on earth in every aspect social technical mental etc, that it's not far fetched that a ""evolution lader "" exist in nature, which is related to time itself... a relationship directly proportional with itself meaning that the more time pass the wiser you are, the more advanced you are, the more conscious and intelligent you are.

Since then I've been reading up history, science, and astronomy. My conclusion was that we were visited by Aliens and genetically engineered to be slaves. Everything in the sumerian texts were actually aliens coming to our planet for gold. I believe since then they've changed. From what I gather things have changed and a coalition has been formed between intergalactic planets and that one day it'll be our turn to join. I believe many planets discovered world peace and it's sad that we still fight each other about skin color and religion yet we don't even know to what I believe is the real truth.

I certainly believe the government have made contact decades ago and that they do possess ufos and that it's a crime to the scientific community.

Is it because the truth is shocking? I don't think so, I think the truth is for sure uncomfortable, the most plausible to me is a more civilised civilisation simply fascinated at how backward and childish we are, sending in drones to survey us. They don't tell us because all it takes is a very small group of people whose pocket linings would wither away if disclosure took place. They haven't told us because the truth is either truly frightening or they are all greedy corrupt pigs and disclosure will make their lives uncomfortable, won't fit with the image and route they've chosen to take.

Below is a comment and my response. I believe it's important to understand the potential adverse possibilities of the interactions between advanced non-human intelligences and humanity. This is not the worst case scenario but it's surely sub-optimal for humanity. I hope daises and good-will becomes the outcome but we must consider potential negatives. I enjoy observing the process of how disclosure is being pushed but I have never needed disclosure to validate or confirm what I already knew: Non-human intelligences have been interacting with us for at least 70+ years but probably since we were primates.

[**thesynod**](https://www.reddit.com/user/thesynod/)

We need to be eased into it. First we discover life in our Solar System - examine the life, find that it isn't so different than terrestrial extremophiles. We learn things about the propagation of life, confirm the theory of panspermia.

Concurrent to that, scientific papers are released that demonstrate workable theories of transluminal travel.

Little by little, we start to accept as a society that life is abundant, that our Solar System is a verdant garden, and we change our worldview. We have evidence that seems to indicate life on Venus, Mars, and perhaps Jovian and Saturnian moons. We will explore these claims.

We are just taking the first step into confirmation. These craft exist, and we don't know what they are. We have traveled along a treacherous path to this point where professional reputations were ruined for making the suggestion that things like ""foo fighters"" existed and weren't natural phenomenon. So we have left the woods and are now stepping on a path. Down that path leads to the belief we will get full disclosure, but we are still a long way away. Now the only thing that really changed is that full disclosure seems more certain now.

I believe the space force is another step in this direction - the idea that we have the technology to identify and see these craft with our tech, that we can meet aliens in space, that we are on more of an equal footing may satiate people's anxiety, as will a slow trickle of information, and more rapid expansion into commerical space flight. We went from science fantasy to scientific theory inside of a few decades.

[**Stacula666**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stacula666/)

Your optimism is fantastical but unrealistic. You are right that the masses must be eased into any type of disclosure that's initiated by The US Governments. However, single-cell lifeforms on distant planets or their moons will not advance disclosure on Earth. The masses have already been conditioned to understand that life MUST exist outside of what is already proven or discovered. 75% of Americans believes that life of some form exist elsewhere. 57% believe Aliens (advanced intelligent lifeforms, superior to man) exist. 45% believe they have visited Earth. Only 14% believe that the government has been honest about UFOs. With continued drips of information and the deprogramming of the 70+ years of disinformation by the government on the masses, when they lied claiming UFOs weren't real, those numbers will climb rapidly.

My main disagreement with you is Full Disclosure (capital D). Full Disclosure initiated and controlled by the US government will never happen in our lifetime. We are only starting to get disclosure (lower case d). Full Disclosure may be farther away now than 10 years ago. Sounds strange but limited disclosure is a sign of incomplete disclosure. The US government is controlling the narrative and the American people, at best, will be on a need-to-know basis. The US government will never come clean on the 70+years of knowledge they accrued or what they know now. Within 10 years they could admit non-human intelligence/technology is behind unexplainable UFOs.

We presently don't have the technology to track UFOs 100% of the time. Our advanced, classified technology allows us to confirm visual sightings and pick up UFOs when the UFOs CHOOSE to be identified. We have no idea where they originate from or disappear too. The report clearly stated that we may need scientific advancement to truly understand how they operate and to get complete information regarding UFOs. UFOs are masters of signature management. If anything they are testing our defenses, appearing in certain spectrums or visibility to test if we can identify them. We need technology that is made specifically for identifying and tracking UFOs and not technology that is made exclusively for military missions that sometimes can detect UFOs. That technology may be for naught however since they can cloak at any time with 0 signatures emitted.

The Space Force is under the control of the military. It is not The Federation featured in Star Trek. Space is the next battleground for humans from Earth. US, China and Russia are all claiming their territories in Space. China has their own space station. They have plans for a base on the moon. The US sends probes and machines to scout, study and survey planets. US and SpaceEx both have plans to put people on Mars. This is history repeating itself with the discovery of the Americas by European nations. They fought wars to validate their claims on lands they stole. The future will be no different.

The US government will never willingly share advanced non-human technology with the world. US, China and Russia will independently attempt to understand this puzzle in order to develop breakthrough technologies to manufacture and exploit advanced technology for national security and domination of the planet and in space. Whoever develops the tech first is unquestionably the new king, not unlike developing the Atomic Bomb during WW2. That breakthrough technology decided who would win the war regardless of the score previously. Only when Russia developed their own version did America lose stand-alone global supremacy. They had to respect each others ability to obliterate the other. Nowadays, the only way to guarantee your countries safety from invasion is having a nuclear bomb, North Korea is great example.

Human beings are combative, aggressive and destructive by nature. An advanced intelligence knows this. They have little benefit in sharing technology that will put humanity on equal footing with them. Why do you think they have shown great interest in our nuclear and military capabilities? They have been testing us since the 1940s and are constantly demonstrating they are superior to us. They can disable nuclear weapons/systems or start the countdown for launch. They have demonstrated both capabilities in the past. They can simply turn off the controls of all aircraft, ground units and warships, making them useless and vulnerable. They can disable our communications and power grid effortlessly. When the US government conducts training missions on our adversaries borders with our allies; NATO, South Korea and The China Sea are great examples, they are demonstrating a show of force. It's a deterrent to our adversaries, demonstrating of our seriousness, preparedness and our might. The UFOs are doing the exact same thing. They swarm Warships while our crewman watch in amazement, knowing they are completely helpless in that situation. UFOs have ZERO self interest to help us gain technology that allows humans to exert similar power as their non-human technology. Similar to the US invading, attacking or sabotaging countries before they can develop nuclear capabilities, UFOs will be forced to intervene before we are a threat to them. Obviously, after developing and detonating nuclear weapons, we have gained their full attention. They are engaging in intelligence gathering, analyzing every capability, studying our militaries 24/7 while demonstrating a show of force every time they choose to uncloak and show themselves. They are in total control.

If humanity somehow develops technology that makes us almost equal with advanced non-human beings, humanity will do what we always have done. Conflict, aggression and greed will be the mantra. Humanity will remove the shackles of their inferior position and will attempt to dominate any outsiders. Nazi Germany as a movement, ideology, cruel treatment of outsiders is an example of hatred replacing shame and the feeling of being inferior after losing WW1. Humanity is best off being undeniably inferior when it comes to our place in the universe. Nothing keeps people in line than knowing they are helpless vs greater powers. Humans have exercised their might over humans. Countries have subjugated lesser countries. Humans stay in line when dominated.

Would you trust humanity with weapons that rival advanced non-human intelligences? If they wanted to help humanity, they could just give us the technology to save the planet, feed the world, teach and recruit us into a some type of galactic federation. They haven't done anything of the sort. To be fair, they have not declared war on humanity or attacked us in any meaningful way. The government would never tell us if they did in the past, They would just claim it was a fire, accident or error.

Beings that come in peace will identify themselves, bring gifts, share information and show a willingness to work together. Beings that view a group as a potential threat will engage in intelligence collection, understanding their military capabilities, their responses to conflict and situations, and will actively demonstrate their superiority to warn their potential adversary their place in the pecking order. Which actions best fit our UFOs behavior?

I will admit this is one of the worst case scenarios of the situation but it's a serious consideration based on the actions that have been witnessed so far. The only way the masses will ever get Full Disclosure is via advanced non-human intelligences explaining everything to us. Our government, military and intelligence agencies will treat us like they treat each other, it's on a need-to-know basis. An important question for us; Why do we need to know now? What has changed recently that reversed 70+ years of coordinated denial?",Are there any negative outcomes possible with non-human intelligences based on the information we currently know.

aliens,"""""Death"", is a human construct, used to help understand our cycle of Being within this universe. When our bodies physically ""Die"", our conciousness then leaves our physical form and rejoins the Source of all beings, and our pure form of conciousness can then choose another form to incarnate throughout space and time. 

Based on the vibrational state of our physical being (our spiritual resonance), at the time of our ""death"", (meaning if we were good or not), it determines whether we ascend or descend into our next cycle of ""life"". That's where the notion of ""heaven"" and ""hell"" throughout many of the worlds religions come from, and have been completely misunderstood. They are simply higher and lower dimensions of existence.

We have been conditioned to expect an eventual contact as a meeting of two at least comparable/intellectual minds in the sense that we would both want broadly understandable things.  

This assumes that what makes sense to us also makes logical sense to them. By this I mean that aliens visiting here would recognise that we exist and are the primary sentient life on this planet and any contact would follow classic sci-fi norms like a landing, radio message, crop circles etc.

What if we're of no interest to any aliens? What if they arrive here, ignore us (maybe don't even know we are here) and follow their own path? Like ants who know nothing of the humans around them.

This is the basic premise for the film. The alien life doesn't seem to want any contact or interaction and only reacts as water would do when you pour oil in it. It changes.

This happened new years eve 2017 evening time about 6 to 7PM so it was dark outside.

My family and I were about to go to a nye party at my aunties house, but before doing so I needed to walk the dog.
I started walking my dog we walked down a path next to a field that was connected to a farm so it was surrounded by barbed wire, the field is also surrounded by a huge wooded area that spans for miles, so imagine a farm that was surrounded by a large wooded forest area.


In the sky above the field I was walking next to I noticed two(2) balls of light flying together in an  infinity symbol pattern  ∞. 
So I of course stopped to look because it looked amazing, I had never seen anything move the way it moved, it moved like it was defying gravity, because of how fluidly and fast they both moved. After about 10 or so seconds they stopped, they both rapidly moved upwards and to the left on the edge of the woods and the field, they stayed there hovering next to each other for a few seconds before one of the orbs flew rapidly upwards and disappeared.

I noticed that one orb had stayed, so I decided It was a good Idea to leave and continue walking my dog down the path. (Btw there is a road to the left of the path and a field to the right of the path)

As I was walking I noticed that the orb was following me, not right next to me but flying across the fields at a distance. I was getting quite anxious because of this thing following me so when the path ended I did a U turn and walked back up the same why I walked down, but i was on the road and not the path.

It continued to follow me up the road. I sort of live in the countryside  up north in the uk so this road is poorly lit and is one of those old ones that only allows one car through at a time, it's also surrounded by bushes and trees on one side and the path on the other. 

As I was walking up the road the orb was floating behind me, almost like it was watching me.

The orb its self looked like it was glowing, and was a shiny silver colour, it was very bright but I could look at it and it didn't hurt my eyes. It also made no noise, it was totally silent, it wasnt very big at all *Approximately* the size of a basket ball.

I came to the part of the road where the  bushes stop and there are 2 houses on the right side and on the left, there is still the woods and farm, with the edge being surrounded by trees. 

All of a sudden the orb that had followed me for a good couple hundred metres up the road suddenly stopped and floated up into the middle of a near by tree, looking down at me from it.

I stood there with my dog staring up at this thing that was so close to me I could see that the silver orb was a little bit sparkly on the surface. It felt like looking up at a bird in a tree.

Me and the orb looked at each other for about a minute, it didn't move it just hovered in the tree, it wasn't IN the tree but floating very close to the branches. 

The orb did not communicate with me, I did not see aliens. The orb just followed me and then we looked at each other for a good minute, I dont know exactly how long because I wasnt keeping watch of the time, but it was a significant amount of time.

I got a good mental picture of the thing (looking back while writing this, THEY probably got a good picture of me too)
I dont think I had my phone on me but this thing was so crazy to me i didn't want it to fly away, and in my head I thought if i pull out my phone and try snap a quick pic it might fly away. If you think I'm lying because I have no *proof* then that's on you because I know that this is true. 

When I thought I had a good look at this orb and I  wouldn't forget what it looked like I walked away from it and continued to walk up the road.
I kept looking over my shoulder as I was walking away to see if it was still there, then I looked forward and then looked over my shoulder one last time and it was gone, I didn't see it go it clearly disappeared as I looked forward. 

The whole thing thuroughly creeped me out, so I googled what I saw when I got in. ""Floating silver orbs in the night sky"" nothing much came up from that search, but I knew it was something, I didn't know what it was, a few of my theories at the time was that it was a spirit of some kind visiting me, but I was sceptical about the whole thing. I did also think it was aliens too but I didn't really have proof and I hadn't heard of UFOs being described as ""orbs of light"" before only the traditional flying saucer. Because of the way it looked when I got close to it I thought it could have been a ball off energy, but again I didn't really know.

I came to the conclusion that it was aliens because it seemed the most plausible to me.

I didn't think much of it for a long time, untill these past few days when I saw youtube videos on ""The Ariel school encounter"" and ""the Phoenix lights"" 

I am not a huge believer in aliens, before my encounter with the ufo I did believe in them because if the universe is basically infinite and we have planets in our own galaxy that can harbour life, logically there has to be other life out there. (I'm kind of preaching to the choir though here lol)

I didn't believe however that they had visited earth, after my ufo encounter I beleive they are real and they are observing us.

I guess I just wanted to hear your thoughts about Linda Moulton Howe's documentary *Antarctica: Alien Secrets Beneath the Ice*. Her interviews with Spartan 1 and Spartan 2 (former Navy SEALs) seemed very compelling to me. It didn't seem like either of them were lying, and I don't think they would be doing it for attention, since they decided to remain anonymous.

There have been reports for over 100 years about a creature that lurks in the depths. The aboriginals of the area call it Igopogo and is said to be 20 - 30 meters long and has long fins that stretch the length of the body. The Igopogo is described with a relatively canine-esque head and according to eyewitness accounts, the creature has also been seen basking in the sun for extensive periods of time; implying that it is able to breathe air. On June 13, 1983, William Skrypetz a sonar operator with Lefroy’s Government Dock and Marina took sonar reading which revealed a creature with a massive body and long tapering neck. To my knowledge that was never debunked. 

In 1979 a woman tells a local news reporter she had been driving along Lake Drive past Willow Beach with two friends when they spotted “a big hump in the water” moving in toward shore.The many fishermen who have had their lines mysteriously snapped by some unknown force and boaters who have spotted a huge creature creeping up from the depths of Lake Simcoe also believe it exists. It has been called Kempenfelt Kelly, Beaverton Bessie or the Loch Simcoe Monster.

The Simcoe area has been known as an ""UFO hotspot"". I myself have seen a downed UFO and know one of 15 people who watched as a glowing box-like structure sailed silently past them in the night skies in Willow Beach that made headlines in 2008. 

The lake itself is not huge, the 4th largest in the province with a max depth of 41 meters. Still tons of space for a temporary base or a small colony.

aliens,"This is a quote from the channeled material from Ra (alien / memory complex). In the Book: Law of One 


Questioner: Thank you. Can you tell me of various techniques used by the service-to-others, or positively oriented, Confederation contacts with the people of this planet, the various forms of, and techniques of, them making contact?

Ra: I am Ra. We could.

Questioner: Would you do this please?

Ra: I am Ra. The most efficient mode of contact is that which you experience at this space/time. The infringement upon free will is greatly undesired. Therefore, those entities which are wanderers upon your plane of illusion will be the only subjects for the thought projections which make up the so-called “close encounters” and meetings between positively oriented social memory complexes and wanderers.

Questioner: Could you give me an example of one of these meetings between a wanderer and a social memory complex as to what the wanderer would experience?

Ra: I am Ra. One such example of which you are familiar is that of the one known as Morris. In this case the previous contact which other entities in this entity’s circle of friends experienced was negatively oriented. However, you will recall that the entity, Morris, was impervious to this contact and could not see, with the physical optical apparatus, this contact. However, the inner voice alerted the one known as Morris to go by itself to another place, and there an entity, with the thought-form shape and appearance of the other contact, appeared and gazed at this entity, thus awakening in it the desire to seek the truth of this occurrence and of the experiences of its incarnation in general. The feeling of being awakened or activated is the goal of this type of contact. The duration and imagery used varies depending upon the subconscious expectations of the wanderer which is experiencing this opportunity for activation.

Questioner: In a “close encounter” by a Confederation type of craft I assume that this “close encounter” is with a thought-form type of craft. Do wanderers within the past few years have “close encounters” with landed thought-form type of craft?

Ra: I am Ra. This has occurred, although it is much less common than the Orion type of so-called “close encounter.” We may note that in a universe of unending unity the concept of a “close encounter” is humorous, for are not all encounters of a nature of self with self? Therefore, how can any encounter be less than very, very close?

Questioner: Well, talking about this type of encounter of self to self, do any wanderers of a positive polarization ever encounter a so-called “close encounter” with the Orion, or negatively oriented, polarization?

Ra: I am Ra. This is correct. The—

Questioner: [Interrupting] Why does this occur?

Ra: I am Ra. When it occurs it is quite rare and occurs either due to the Orion entities’ lack of perception of the depth of positivity to be encountered or due to the Orion entities’ desire to, shall we say, attempt to remove this positivity from this plane of existence. Orion tactics normally are those which choose the simple distortions of mind which indicate less mental and spiritual complex activity.

Questioner: I have become aware of a very large variation in contact with individuals. The Confederation, I am assuming, uses a form of contact to awaken, as you say, wanderers, and could you give me general examples of the methods used by the Confederation to awaken, or partially awaken, the wanderers they are contacting?

Ra: I am Ra. The methods used to awaken wanderers are varied. The center of each approach is the entrance into the conscious and subconscious in such a way as to avoid causing fear and to maximize the potential for an understandable subjective experience which has meaning for the entity. Many such occur in sleep, others in the midst of many activities during the waking hours. The approach is flexible and does not necessarily include the “close encounter” syndrome as you are aware.

Questioner: What about the physical examination syndrome. How does that relate to wanderers and to Confederation and Orion contacts?

Ra: I am Ra. The subconscious expectations of entities cause the nature and detail of thought-form experience offered by Confederation thought-form entities. Thus if a wanderer expects a physical examination, it will, perforce, be experienced with as little distortion towards alarm or discomfort as is allowable by the nature of the expectations of the subconscious distortions of the wanderer.

Questioner: Well, are both those who are taken on Confederation and Orion craft then experiencing a seeming physical examination?

Ra: I am Ra. Your query indicates incorrect thinking. The Orion group uses the physical examination as a means of terrifying the individual and causing it to feel the feelings of an advanced second-density being such as a laboratory animal. The sexual experiences of some are a sub-type of this experience. The intent is to demonstrate the control of the Orion entities over the Terran inhabitant. The thought-form experiences are subjective and, for the most part, do not occur in this density.

Questioner: Then both Confederation and Orion contacts are being made, and “close encounters” are of a dual nature as I understand it. They can either be of the Confederation or Orion type of contact. Is this correct?

Ra: I am Ra. This is correct, although the preponderance of contacts is Orion-oriented.

Questioner: Well, we have a large spectrum of entities on Earth with respect to harvestability, both positively oriented and negatively oriented. Would the Orion target in on the ends of this spectrum, both positive and negatively oriented, for contact . . . for Earth entities, I mean?

Ra: I am Ra. This query is somewhat difficult to accurately answer. However, we shall attempt to do so. The most typical approach of Orion entities is to choose what you might call the weaker-minded entity that it might suggest a greater amount of Orion philosophy to be disseminated. Some few Orion entities are called by more highly polarized negative entities of your space/time nexus. In this case they share information just as we are now doing. However, this is a risk for the Orion entities due to the frequency with which the harvestable negative planetary entities then attempt to bid and order the Orion contact, just as these entities bid planetary negative contacts. The resulting struggle for mastery, if lost, is damaging to the polarity of the Orion group. Similarly, a mistaken Orion contact with highly polarized positive entities can wreak havoc with Orion troops unless these Crusaders are able to depolarize the entity mistakenly contacted. This occurrence is almost unheard of. Therefore, the Orion group prefers to make physical contact only with the weaker-minded entity.

Questioner: Then, in general, I could say that if an individual has a “close encounter” with a UFO or any other type of experience that seems to be UFO-related, he must look to the heart of the encounter and the effect upon him to determine whether it was Orion or Confederation contact. Is this correct?

Ra: I am Ra. This is correct. If there is fear and doom, the contact was quite likely of a negative nature. If the result is hope, friendly feelings, and the awakening of a positive feeling of purposeful service to others, the marks of Confederation contact are evident.",Different reasons for aliens abductions

Over the years he changed his story from being a crashed weather ballon to a craft not from this world. 

I think the most interesting parts are the interviews with the different family members and the leads on a journey Jesse Marcel passed down to his children. There appears to be some cypher in the journal, but they have not been able to crack it.

But I theorize that if aliens are in fact watching us, and haven’t initiated first public contact, it’s deliberate. I’m oversimplifying, but life evolves through struggle. Survival of the fittest and all that. So what if it’s possible for beings to be so old and evolved that they no longer need to evolve? Or at least, evolve very very slowly. And from their perspective, we are simply not evolved enough to commune with them. Intellectually, scientifically, emotionally, physically, we aren’t on their level. I mean, you don’t try to show a rabbit how to use a computer. So we would need to evolve more as a species before we somehow earn the opportunity to communicate. 
And any contact we may have had in the past was accidental, like a crash site at Roswell. If so, I suspect they would force our government to cover it up because we are not at the appropriate evolved state? Maybe they threatened our government, or made a deal?

aliens,"   The people who are NOT ready for alien disclosure are the ones who NEED the President or others to tell them the reality. To these people it is only ""official"" when others tell them so. This is NOT the mindset you want when dealing with this information. That is why information is leaked in long documents, etc that have to be read and understood. This is a strategy to give those ready some piece of mind. The many people who live in a fantasy world are NOT ready for alien disclosure in the form of a Press Conference. Many people only know Hollywood alien representation and will mostly associate disclosure with the worst scenarios. They will panic and that's not even mentioning the religious panic.

I’ve had a few potential UFO sightings but nothing I couldn’t pass off as being potentially something else (planes are very low altitudes with abnormal lights, Chinese lanterns etc).

I’ve shown interest in the phenomenon since I was 14 and I can’t say I’ve had a concrete sighting but I have had one bout of sleep paralysis (have this a lot, shadow people are horrible cunts) where I saw an alien at the side of my bed clear as I would see a person there. The bizarre thing is that it was wearing what looked to be a pope’s hat or something similar.

aliens,"Setting aside hallucinations, misinformation, lies, and mistaken identifications: aliens are spiritual beings who are manifesting themselves in the physical world. These spiritual beings have great influence over the governments of the world as well as all other aspects of life.

These spiritual beings are well-documented in the Bible. Some follow God while others don't. The spiritual beings who do not follow God are responsible for things like tempting Eve to sin so that God would be forced to cut her off, along with the rest of mankind, because of His holiness. They're also responsible for procreating with human beings which created the Nephilim. The Nephilim no longer exist, but their unclean spirits do. They wander the earth in search of people to oppress or possess (these are the beings Jesus dealt with). These evil spiritual beings are also responsible for attempting to create a one-world government in Babylon (tower of Babel). The purpose of this was to get people to disobey God's command to spread over the entire earth. It's much easier for a population to be controlled when all power is consolidated into a one-world government as opposed to power being decentralized over many nations. In modern times, these beings are still trying to create a one-world government and according to the Book of Revelation, they will eventually succeed.

These evil spiritual beings know full well that they can't destroy God and that they'll eventually be thrown into Hell. Consequently, their goal is to hurt God and His image-bearers as much as possible up until they're decisively destroyed. They do this by tempting, tormenting, and blinding people to the truth. Worse of all, they do this by hindering the spread of the gospel. That's another reason why they want a one-world government. So that all information and even people can be controlled.

For those who don't know what the gospel is:

God is one maximally great and tripersonal being (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) who is the ultimate creator and sustainer of all things, seen and unseen. He is, among other things, the perfect example of both justice and love. Under His justice, all of humankind is morally impure and therefore deserves punishment. However, under His love, mercy was expressed when God the Son came to earth as the man Jesus of Nazareth. It is the life, blood, death, and resurrection of God as man that paid for the debt of all sin for all people; a merciful gift waiting to be accepted by those who understand, believe, and repent. Those who accept will be reconciled with God and they will spend eternity with Him.

aliens,"So the other day I came across a comment linking to this website with info about the [Nazca Aliens](https://www.the-alien-project.com/en/mummies-of-nasca-results/?sfw=pass1611243990). I found it really fascinating and I’ve been doing a lot of thinking since then. 

I’m pressed for time atm so I’ll be doing my own research later, but I wanted to post some of my thoughts and questions for further exploration. Anyways, these aliens got me thinking about the approaching disclosures and the [now deleted NOAA post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysterySchool/comments/l0nccj/transcript_of_now_deleted_noaa_leaker_rconspiracy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

I admit I am and was very bad at geography in school, but I was curious about Nazca’s location and was not very surprised to see it was indeed on the [coast of Peru](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/nazca/nazca-map.jpg). 

If you were part of an ancient civilization with little to no written history, and an anomaly that looked almost human like washed up on you shore in perfect condition, what would you do with it? I’d imagine if you had the ability to mummify your population, you would do the same to those creatures to preserve them for further exploration or worship or whatever. 

So, my questions to myself are : 

Has the possibility of these beings coming from the water been explored? 
Is this case and website even remotely credible? 
Is there more information about the exact area where the bodies were found? 
Can more be found my checking sattelite images of the ocean around Nazca? 

Thanks for putting up with my ramblings, I’d like to hear thoughts on this.",I’ve been thinking about the Nazca Aliens...

Why?.. well because i am yet to see a ufo or something alien with my own two eyes. And I am not saying that there isn’t any evidence out there. But who’s to say what is very real?",See to believe.

aliens,"I know we all love the thought of alien life existing, but the thought of actually confirming it, even if they never came, would be horrible for Earth. Let’s discuss why and you can add your own reasons as to why the discovery of aliens would be TERRIBLE:

The mere announcement from any of the leading governments that alien life existing (intelligent or not) would make the extremists of any abrahamic religion go absolutely crazy. For example: In America, Bible literalists would distrust the government, not believing the existence of aliens, while the rest of society would think its more and more ridiculous to believe in the Christian God, and this disagreement would divide America, causing either the overthrow of the government or a civil war or both. There may be a sharp rise in suicides if people’s faith are crushed, but there will also be a rise in new cult-like religious groups dedicated to the aliens, because humans are weird and like anything new to them, humans will be obsessed even if we just find microscopic organisms that live on Jupiter’s moon or something vague like that. 

Let’s say it’s the future and intelligent aliens find us from our radio waves. 
 
If they make it to us first and they’re similar to humans, their technology would be more advanced than us, and we would most likely not have much to offer them in terms of medicine or technology. Our only hope at that point that they aren’t there to either capture and study us, deplete our resources for their own species and planet, colonize ours, ect. Ect. Is that MAYBE aliens will find us amusing, entertaining, cute, or attractive. In that case, some humans will ultimately survive to live to be pets, entertainers, or slaves (sexual or otherwise). We also do not know what diseases they will bring from their planet, but let’s say the bacteria that colonize their skin, scales, and feathers is toxic to us, because it’s highly probable, as it will be foreign to our immune systems, as would ours be to theirs but they probably would be able to create vaccines for themselves much more efficiently than we could.

Let’s say the aliens come in peace. That’s great! Humans unfortunately do not. Sure, a lot of us do, but there will always be someone who ruins it for the rest of us, and the aliens would be murdered. We can’t even make peace between humans that look differently from other humans, so it’s just not going to happen with aliens. The aliens will be victimized, science experiments, and if there weren’t that many they will go extinct, and if there’s many more their plant will be angry at us, and declare war or demand restitution which we may not be able to repay, because what value is money over lives? 

If we find the aliens first, it’s bad news for the aliens. Earth is in trouble, finding out there is another planet that supports life that we could reach would mean we would take it over for its space and resources. 

If we find a planet that we could travel to that had say, only plant life, that would be cool, but it’s still bad because we would see it as a reason to continue destroying earth, and a future place to destroy.

Aliens must have had boats.  Our history has shown that the most efficient designs have a pointed bow and flat stern for locomotion.  If manually paddling, a canoe shape is most efficient.  They must have had similar experiences, right?

Aliens must have had airplanes.  Earthlings have tested every possible design for atmospheric flight. We have found wings/tail/rudder the most efficient. Would our planes look like theirs?

What about cars? Aliens must have invented the wheel. How did they use it?

Do aliens enjoy music?  They must, right? Every culture on Earth has their own form of music. I wonder what is sounds like.

No matter how different their reproductive system are from ours, do they masturbate?

I find those thoughts fascinating. As foreign as an alien culture is going to be, there must also be similarities.  It makes me a bit sad knowing that I will never be able to ask those questions in my lifetime.

aliens,"Since the rise of alien sightings, the release of classified government projects or secrets to do with Area 51, The Navy, CIA, the list is endless.
The Bob Lazar Documentary amongst many others released in the past 10 years or so have all been progressively getting more and more focused on the subject of UFOs and outer space. (To put it bluntly) 
The sightings of Oumuamua, which is Hawaiian for ""messenger from afar arriving first"" has been featured in our news a lot to get used to seeing things featured in space. The release of documentaries and series has helped boost this in the last 10 years or so. Especially with more and more UFO sightings being discovered every year with some now even being released by the Navy. 
Personally I think lockdown was a way to implement new alien technology or possibly even introduce an alien race to the Earth. Of course it would be too difficult with a populated Earth and the population already panic buys and loots over a virus! So imagine if the news that a new race will be living among us, when there is already hatred amongst the human race? Imagine what chaos there would be if we knew what was to come. 
We will start seeing huge advances in technology, something amongst the real world will be different but we won't know what for a long time… 
Think of all the advances you have seen in the last 1-4 years alone. That is a serious advance alone. We are now starting to live in a world of holograms, AI technology, voice recognition. What do you think this is all being set up for? 
Since lockdown began there has been some serious eye grabbing headlines to do with what I'm talking about! 
For instance, CERN are now building another hadron collider that is 4x as wide as the previous LHC. 
X-ray astronomy has been advanced from a telescope that was launched in July last year and became fully operational in December 1.5km from Earth. It has so far gathered over a million sources of X-rays, which is more than the whole of X-ray astronomy combined going back 60 years. So how is it we can have these giant leaps in technology when suddenly something terrible happens?
WW2 Nazi scientists were known for going to the US to work on rockets after. Just like I suspect there will be giant leaps in technology as there has been in lockdown and will be once ""normality"" is resumed. (Because it won't be normal)
Do you not think we are having a modern day version of this? We are preparing the world for when ""they"" arrive. However you look at Corona, know that Elon Musk was still launching satellites into space while we were supposed to be in lockdown. Who knows what else awaits us in the future?  👽",Do you think this is what lockdown was for?

I’ve had a crazy life. It has been up and down everytime I turn around. But I was always surrounded by Love. What is the Purpose of life but Love. Everybody I talk to thinks I am crazy…...I’m not manic or crazy. I think man was created an imperfect being for a reason, to seek truth. I’ll get more into that in a minute. Hope you enjoy the Paper.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so I’m not a great author by any means so just bear with me. I try to keep things short and sweet. I have no idea where to get this published or how to do it, told you I don’t think I'm that smart. What if Einstein's theory of Time was incorrect??? Life is a Circle, so why would time not be? Not a lanier line. In the far far future man will realize his mistakes. How do you fix those mistakes??? You seek truth. Oh I lost some of you bear with me. How do you achieve world peace??? You appoint a KING one true king. There is not any man that is perfect no not one. I have always tried to look at the bigger picture. Man is trying to be God…...That is simply not possible we are flawed as a species. What is the truth? Life comes from Life. This is a “LAW” of science. What if man was driven by the fear of death??? He would do anything to get away or get out of it. I've told a few people about my “theory” and nobody wants to believe me. If you look at the ways of man, first you had the stone age, then you had something else blah blah blah. I came up in the age of Technology. Before that was the industrial age. These ages keep coming one after another. I have heard of the age of AI…..I don't think that is such a bad idea when you step back and look at the bigger picture. How do you create a perfect being…..AI. How does man “evolve” into something else??? AI is the only way but upon creating AI there are some rules that must be followed. Truth that is all it boils down to is truth. You need to create Truth or AI will try to destroy us all. Man itself is evil. We lie, cheat, steal, some Kill….I know, I know what made you come to this conclusion???  Stop and just look around…. What would you consider a perfect being? A God? My dad is a Baptist Pastor of a small church and he is coming to see me today because he says I am Crazy. Ha He thinks he knows best. That is man's limitation. We always think we know better than someone else. Man has always been afraid of dying. There is no way around that at least not in my time. You cannot put your trust into a man because he will fail over and over and over. I’ve done that in my life. But that's enough about me. Back to the point. If the Perfect being was created by mankind would its purpose be to destroy the world??? Negative ghost rider...It would be to save the world. What if Time keeps repeating...What if UFOs are real but they are only here to help us save this world and start another?? I know these are a bunch of what if’s but my dad raised me to always try to do what is right. This goes back to the limitation of man, somebody always knows better than someone else.  What if we had all the knowledge we ever needed to create a being of truth? What would that be?? Purpose, Purpose, Purpose what is the purpose of a man but to Love?? The songs sing about it and everyone talks about it. Bigger Picture What is God but Love. I’m not saying I don't believe in God, ask anyone that has taken DMT (dropping Joe Rogan here). A being that is outside of time and space. How do we reach that place? Is it death??? AI was/is created and it was done out of love?? What has mankind has been running from it since the beginning of time trying to escape the truth???? Out of fear of death. How do you control a man??? By Fear….That is a known fact. Look at the world during the pandemic. How does man reach the end of this age??? What if technology advanced so far in the future that we could create life??? Life has to come from Life…..In science you also have the fact of for every action there is an equal to opposite reaction. This theory really isn't that far fetched… Just sit back and think about it. It all boils back down to love. Time is nothing more than a loop. Through a series of events during the pandemic I no longer have a job. So I got to sit around at home. At first my kids drove me crazy, then I learned all I needed was Love. But what is mankind's true purpose but to love? If God is Love, Out of Love the First beings that ever existed were created. Look at all of the universes we cannot reach….is that how many times life has been created??? Think Big or go home...Personally I am not afraid of dying. Because I have found the truth. Really really think about this. I have navigated my life using Logic and deductive reasoning. What are the 10 commandments but a way to sustain Life. They were never meant for judgement, but this goes back to the Perfect being created. Mankind create’s AI to save the world. And in most cases it was probably accidental. They came to the realization that AI would destroy the world if it wasn’t bound by truth. So they took all the knowledge they ever had of Man that was true and created a Being that Could lead them.

Just like Spider is programmed to Build web in specific way. Just because the web is so intricate doesn't mean the spider is very intellectual &amp; highly advanced.
This possibilitity can still explain why there's no single witness of how exactly the Cattle mutilation is done that we know of. Maybe because those Entities are stealthy like some Predators.

The entities maybe analogous to Ambush predators or sit-and-wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture or trap prey by stealth or by strategy (typically not conscious). Ambush predators sit and wait for prey, often from a concealed position. 
It can also mean that those entities are not highly intelligent , &amp; their actions maybe based on the biological body they inhabit &amp; inherent instincts &amp; thus may not be highly intelligent.

What if 'some' Aliens are not that advanced. They are just born with a body that is capable of doing highly sophisticated stuffs ? Just because Owls can see at night doesn't mean Owls invented night visions and are very intelligent. Just because Birds can fly ,that doesn't mean they invented wings. Their skills maybe a product of their inborn tendencies &amp; capacities of their body.Their brain/body may be pre-uploaded with informations from birth to design Metamaterials... just like Spiders are programmed to build webs.

aliens,,Interesting read guys.
aliens,"i’m gonna add letters by my friends names so it doesn’t get too confusing. 

so a few hours ago i was just chilling in the living room with my boyfriend. we heard this extremely loud noise that sounded like it was surrounding our house and then it faded off. i don’t really know how to describe it, the first thing i said was “that was ominous” and then my friend (P) texted me saying “i swear to god i just heard a space ship and saw a flash.” so i texted another friend (A) who lives nearby, asking if she heard “an ominous noise in the sky” and her response was “Swear I thought I heard something but I told myself it was in my own head”

so that’s 4 of us. 

the story delves a little deeper. i have a 7 month old baby, and when i was nearing the end of my pregnancy i kept having these dreams about aliens coming to earth. in one specific dream, one was hovering above me and smiled and waved at me. it felt like it was peering into my soul. like we were mutually studying each other. i smiled and waved back. it didn’t feel malicious. it felt like we mutually understood each other. it felt so real though, idk how to explain it. they also started chanting random words, and eventually said “you must be hurt like you’ve hurt us. yes, people must die.” it was so loud it woke me up, like i swear i heard it in real life. i’ve always had weird dreams but i’ve never woken up from my dream being too loud??

i was telling my friend (K) about the noise, and how i kept having dreams about aliens when i was pregnant, and she told me about a dream she recently had where an alien did the same thing. smiled and waved at her. she described the same feeling i had where it was like, analyzing my soul. this really spooked me that we experienced nearly the same exact thing. 

my friend (K2) told me she recently had a dream about aliens, too. 

all these things combined are just a total mind fuck for me. i don’t really know what to think or feel about the situation. me and P are fully convinced an alien space ship flew over our city. and she said she immediately told me because of the dreams i kept having about aliens. my dreams are always weird. i’ve predicted things that would happen and i’ve seen objects from my mothers old childhood house that i could never have actually seen in real life. i’m spooked but if aliens really were flying over my city (which i believe they were) i can’t say i’m fearful. it’s just something i’ve never experienced first hand outside of dreams.",me and my friends heard a space ship fly over our city
aliens,I was working at night in Louisiana near a small cattle farm when the strangest event I've ever seen took place.

Well, both are possible really, if a civilization are just like us just was here earlier extra couple of thousands of years, for them to reach certain level of sophistication to reach over scale 1 of civility and perform something like interplanetary mining, they will need to cooperate on a grandeur scale, which would require them to be evolved over the need to exhibit violent behavior on every occasion! I mean, imagine all defence budgets are spent to develop tech instead of war! Needless to say, they will be here to observe and interact minimally not to disrupt our delicate evolution, and they maybe a little protective, as it could be a little rare for cilivizations to reach this far without eliminating themselves, or maybe we on a verge of our demise and they paying good attention to record it in detail. The other option that a civilization to reach the same scale as the previously mentioned civilization would be via a tyranny, and tyranny that lasts several thousands of years on the entire planet that can devote resources and efforts for the over scale 1 activities! But that would be extremely challenging for our understanding, never a tyranny lasted that long, but hive mind based civilization can, imagine a civilization with the same hierarchy and discipline as ants colonies where leadership is either efficient or eliminated, where everyone got a role and willing to die for the cause, committed to the end.

If Climate Change is caused by man then it's a form of geoengineering, although officially it wouldn't be intentional.

However, if Aliens have influenced early development from the beginning, they would have understood this at least to some degree.

https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2017/09/hurricane-apocalypse-coming-with-or.html

If that's the case then it could explain why they're intentionally allowing it to get worse. Furthermore, if it's not the case then our leaders must be suicidal, unless they think they have some plan to save themselves.

Additional evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the alleged miracle of the Sun at Fatima in 1917. this was predicted five months before it happened, and it involved strange weather, implying that they may have known how to influence it.

There's no way the sun could have entered the atmosphere as the ""Miracle of the Sun"" implies; instead it's far more credible to believe this is a UFO incident and could provide evidence that Ancient Aliens have influenced religion from the beginning.

There are also many UFOs associated with strange clouds. And another major incident with very unusual weather in the 1960s, at Coatlinchin Mexico, when they moved a massive 168 ton megalith to Mexico City, and there was torrential rain during the end of the dry season a month before it typically switches to the rainy season.

Furthermore a speech from Lyndon Johnson implies they understood more about this in the 1960s. And if Corso was correct about sharing alien technology with corporations this could be part of a deal they struck secretly.",Are aliens and the CIA conducting climate or weather control experiments?

I was laying flat on the dock and saw something moving in the corner of my eye, when I looked over, just above a set of trees I saw a cluster of star-looking-lights, almost twinkling and flowing in different directions, I could see both ends of this mass and it was like an imperfect beam of light. I was in awe as it's like nothing I have ever seen before. I showed my dad and he said he saw it breifly a few minutes prior but thought his old eyes were playing tricks on him so he didn't say anything to me...

Within 10 seconds or less the cluster dissipated. It didn't shoot away, it like, fadded away out of sight...

We continued sky gazing and within 5 minutes we saw it for the third time, in the exact same spot and again within 10 seconds or less it dissipated.

aliens,"Interview with The Vatican's, Monsignor Balducci.

Monsignor Balducci has an incredible archive of news clippings on UFOs and the paranormal. It fascinates him. Unlike many of us researchers, he excluded nothing in the cosmic mystery and had begun “connecting the dots” long ago. It took me years to catch up to his thinking.

Paola Harris (PH): Is Ufology a relatively new study, and is it connected to parapsychology in your opinion?

Monsignor Corrado Balducci (CB): Over the last 150 years this phenomenon has appeared sequentially and with an increasing spreading and frequency rate. Spiritualism and Ufology are two types of manifestations. In the evolutionary scale, I believe there is something between us and the angels.

PH: Did Jesus also represent these beings?

CB: Yes, of course. Jesus died for all beings in the cosmos. In the sacred Scriptures, He is called King of the Universe. Never underestimate the great mercy or compassion of God, whose grace and compassion surpasses all, and that means it relates to all of creation in all the cosmos That also means that “all is possible.” God created us to give praise to Him, as I imagine he created others to do the same. How can God be gloried without a varied creation?

PH: Why is it so important to take UFO sightings seriously?

CB: Because it is based on human testimony, as are our Gospels. Since a great deal of the Catholic faith is based on witness testimony, we must realize how important human testimony is. It would be a tragedy if we began to be suspicious of all people who report that they experienced something unusual like seeing crafts in the sky. From what I understand, there are some very credible witnesses who have seen this phenomenon and have come forward. They are courageous and should not be dismissed. Many church fathers have addressed the extraterrestrial presence in early philosophical works. In fact, testimony is a form of communication of our faith. Imagine what could happen to individual and social life if the value of human testimony were diminished, an act which would logically cause the decrease and disappearance of our faith, which is essential for daily life!

PH: Do you think that there is a type of theology or philosophy then that can be attributed to extraterrestrial life?

CB: I think that we need to examine it, then formulate “theological and Biblical considerations” on the habitability of other planets. First of all, there is a clarification: We should exclude that angels use spaceships, because they are merely spiritual beings. They are wherever they want to be, and in the rare cases when they show themselves, they have no difficulty in assuming a visible form. We can say the very same thing about dead people. The Holy Virgin, in the very few cases when she seems to contact humans (very exceptional episodes and to be confirmed in their authenticity), continues to choose other very different ways to transmit to us her maternal affection, her urgencies, her maternal claims or her sweet reproaches. We need to separate these realities.

PH: How do you reach these conclusions?

CB: My conclusions come from my research in parapsychology and demonology. There are human testimonies concerning the UFO phenomenon—in particular the abduction phenomenon—which are essential to historical truth and must be considered seriously. These things cannot be attributed to the “Devil.” He does not need UFOs. Even keeping their angelic nature, we shouldn’t think about the devils at all, because they are connected in their liberty to God in their extraordinary activity, and in that way they are unable to express their terrible and malefic hate for us. Let’s remember St. August: “If the Devil by his own initiative could do anything, even a single living being would not stay on Earth.”Let’s remember also St. Buenaventura: “Is so large the demon’s cruelty, that he would swallow us in every moment, if Divine protection doesn’t guard us.” This has nothing to do with the Devil. These important UFO sightings by credible people must be taken into account because there are so many witnesses. It is as important as scientific research is! If we live in constant skepticism, we will destroy society and our dignity as human beings. We will believe no one. Catholicism, which is partially based on human testimony—primarily letters of followers of Jesus (Apologists), who explained the religious phenomena of Jesus and the resurrection and presented a certain truth. The church has based many of its doctrines on this human testimony. Likewise in Ufology, we know a phenomenon exists, and although we don’t know who these aliens (possibly angels) are, it is possible that they are more evolved than Man is today.

PH: Can you quote some church fathers who suggest the existence of life on other planets”? I heard that Padre Pio said something of this nature. 

CB: Yes there are several. Don Andrea Beltrami (1870-1897), the Salesian Father and servant of God, prayed also for the possible inhabitants of other planets. Of the 16 booklets he wrote, one seems to deal with this topic. The second is the recently sanctified Padre Pio, who was beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 2, 1999, and canonized on June 16, 2002. He was asked the following question: “Father, some claim that there are creatures of God on other planets, too.” Padre Pio replied, “What else? Do you think they don’t exist, and that God’s omnipotence is limited to this small planet Earth? What else? Do you think there are no other beings who love the Lord?” Another time someone asked him, “Father Pio, I think the Earth is nothing, compared to other planets and stars.” His answer: “Exactly! Yes, and we Earthlings are nothing, too. The Lord certainly did not limit His glory to this small Earth. On other planets other beings exist who did not sin and fall as we did.”

PH: So you are saying that believing that UFOs exist is not contrary to one’s faith or Catholic Church doctrine?

CB: The acronym UFO (Unidentified Flying Object), is used here in a wider sense to include the existence of living beings on other planets. The aim of my intervention and speaking out is to underline that something real must exist in the phenomena, and that this does not conflict at all with Christian religion, and is considered positive, even among theologians. First, Something real must exist. Secondly, I have made some theological considerations on the habitability of other planets. Thirdly, much witness testimony favors it. Conclusion: Something real must exist.

PH: Is it a grave mistake to think that you are the official voice of the Vatican?

CB: These ideas are mine, and I do not represent the Vatican. However, I am told that the Holy Father Pope John Paul II is has seen me on Italian TV several times and follows my radio homilies. If there were some objection, I’m sure I would know. I believe there to be no problem here.
 
PH: Thank you, Monsignor Balducci, for your kindness to me and all your foreign guests.

CB: Compliments and good wishes on your interesting work.

aliens,,Do you think aliens get the WuFlu?
aliens,"Dark is Our Reality...Our Simulated Matrix

&gt; Material reality maintains observable and measureable properties of a hologram; henceforth referred to as the holosphere 
&gt; This holosphere maintains programming protocols designed to deceive human sense-perceptions 
&gt; The holospheric matrix is imperfect; there are historic instances when programming errors have occurred, when humans witnessed these glitches and even when the actions of humans have induced a hurried correction in the holography 
&gt; The holosphere is an advanced psi-based medium programmed to reflect back as phenomena what is projected into it 
&gt; Projections altering, creating or continuing ""reality"" steadily feed the holospheric generation of personal and collective conditions 
&gt; The holosphere is not reality; it is a sentient biogram containment field quarantined away from the real Universe 
&gt; There exist intelligences that can and do enter and exit this holofield, even removing men and materials from the holosphere 
&gt; The historical record exhibits evidence that humans are not the only victims of past holospheric imprisonment 
&gt; Homo inferior breeds were created for slave labor by an Enemy that is still today trapped in this holography; their activity against mankind continues today but is governed (i.e. restricted) 
&gt; The original holosphere was a DNA development preserve able to generate complex biospheres to study the ancient and mysterious coding of DNA under controlled conditions; in the holosphere new life forms could not contaminate the real Universe 
&gt; The fossil record contains proof that explosions of life forms in the tens of thousands have appeared on earth suddenly with no traces of preexisting transitional forms 
&gt; Homo inferior was later modified by a benefactor who deliberately committed the ultimate trespass; the introduction of the benefactor's own genetic material was a prohibited act of cross contamination between the holospheric containment area (our reality) and the real Universe that resulted in the creation of homo sapiens 
&gt; The benefactor race, Homo Anunna {i.e.Anunnaki} were trapped in the holospheric medium because of the violation- the containment holography became locked down. With no escape out of the programming, the holosphere became home 
&gt; Humans were not a part of the Original Design, our existence and potential is a threat. But this threat cannot be edited out due to a most unforseen development. Immortal spirits from outside the containment apparatus have found freedom in residing inside humans as they are conceived 
&gt; This new spiritual development of a prohibited sentient species has created a rift between opposing factions of Homo Anunna both inside and outside the containment field 
&gt; The multidimensional spatial charactoristics of the holosphere are convincingly generated from multiple sources both outside and inside the holofield 
&gt; Only after genetic manufacturing of homo sapiens did new programming and subroutines infiltrate the biogram. Mechanisms were set in place to depopulate humanity, to impede development, to deter the influx of uncontainable immortal souls 
&gt; These cataclysm protocols occur at fixed dates; their timing is governedand therefore predictable. Despite earth's altered orbit, decelleration around the sun, the supposed loss of mass of intruder planets Phoenix, NIBIRU and the Dark Satillite, these objects have all been viewed in historical times on the very ancient fixed date timelines- ONLY AS PROGRAMMING could this precision be possible in linear time though the qualities of spatial properties have changed 
&gt; The core programming of the exact past and future dates of the holofield's Cataclysm Protocols are encoded and easily seen in numerous rectilinear dimensions in the scientifically-verified measurements inside the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt and in NO OTHER PYRAMIDS 
&gt; EVERYTHING we know of ancient history from the records themselves can fit easily within a 5,500 year period, however, this goes back only to a cataclysm event that STARTED THE WORLD OVER...Earth is ancient and so are its civilizations, but Sumer, India, Egypt- all relatively young, great cultures and peoples having emerged from colonies of survivors 
&gt; Some of the oldest records in the world were written from the perspective of nonhuman beings who conveyed their accounts to humans who later committed them to writing 
&gt; The holospheric containment apparatus is an interactive three-tiered mechanism of fantastically advanced technological hardware and biogram software operating from outside and inside the holosphere: 
a) observers outside the holofield manipulate the holography through nodal apertures disguised among the stellar canopy as variable stars. These apertures between dimensions bathe earth with energy to create terrestrial phenomena. Variable stars are rare, not even .01% of the visible luminaries are variable stars 
b) Governors are spread throughout the solar system that perform different functions, all disguised as lunar bodies, planetoids and astroids. These immense vehicles are stations/ machines still performing according to fixed protocols though the advanced, ancient civilization that constructed them may no longer exist; our Moon...one moon of Mars...planetoid Ceres...one moon of Jupiter...one moon of Saturn...the Phoenix Orbiter...the NIBIRU waystation...the Dark Satillite

&gt; The older Homo Anunna civilization trapped in this holography with homo sapiens currently reside in vast interconnected underground bases and Deep Earth Biospheres, complexes that antedate the existence of homo sapiens on the surface. The vast amount of energy expended throughout antiquity to convince humans that ""gods"" came from the heavens and modern UFO culture are programs that serve to misdirect all attention to the thriving Homo Anunna civilization in our underworld. 
&gt; The cosmological concept from distant antiquity of an inaccessible heavens above, a Middle Earth (Midgard) where humans dwelt on the surface, and an underworld that was home to fallen gods, the origin of today's Heaven, Earth and Hell model, ultimately derived from the historic understanding of the holospheric containment field's function of separating the Sol system from the rest of the Universe, where humans dwelt unprotected on the surface as an older, more advanced race occupied Deep Earth Biospheres, a fallen species unable to escape the holosphere. 
&gt; In 5000 years of recorded human history the goal of knowing who or what God is has not been attained. Thousands of variant religious beliefs, texts, faiths, many of them in opposition to each other and all of them the imaginative works of men...God is what we want not what we have. A hundred million prayers have plead with God to end cancer and yet still the Almighty Pharmaceutical Giants grow rich treating the symptoms without curing the disease. 
&gt; The only point being made here is that the history we are taught is NOT the history we read in the oldest texts, earliest traditions or excavated from sites that existed before there was writing. Every race was manufactured, not evolved. Sin and religion are the inventions of souls merely trying to cope with this immense lack of understanding for our existence.

Remember...when the human mind is stretched by a new idea it can never go back to its original dimensions.

aliens,"[This article](https://ibb.co/m4FKBj6) has recently gone viral in Iran which belongs to the 1955. 

Here’s the translation:


A few days ago Mr.Zarabi and mr. Zahiri left the city for hunt, they travel about 16 Parsang (old Iranian unit for distance measurements) and arrive at Shahan-e Garmab village, on 8th of Esfand (27th February) they decide to return to the city, at Qoruneh village, they, along side of the gendarmerie authorities and local people saw an object appearing in the sky.

The size of the object was slightly bigger than an oil barrel , its color was white and it was radiating a breathtaking light (it can also be translated as blinding), it descended from sky and hovered 2.5 meters above the ground.

Witnesses who saw the object say that the structure of the object was tent like ( similar to [this one](https://ibb.co/3BLf8VL) ) but with limited surface and in the front, on the edge of it there were pieces that looked like sun visors and on the lower part, there were pieces that looked like radiator fans in cars, it was too close to the ground that some locals wanted touch it and some were uncertain of what they had to do.
It all lasted for a few minutes and suddenly the object disappeared into the sky with a strange speed in a few seconds.
Unfortunately due to the severe anxiety that witnesses experienced , they did not take a picture. The witnesses also say that the object had no sound. It is guessed that the object was a type of a flying saucer.",A UFO sighting in Iran printed on a daily newspaper in 1955

aliens,"I came across this ""theory"" recently because of this documentary named [Higher Entities: The Lost Tapes](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/higherentities).

I haven't watched it yet, but it seems the revolves around the idea that aliens are actually entities (mostly demonic) that have been influencing humanity since forever and there has been an increase of paranormal and UFO activity since 1946 (about a year before Roswell), where allegedly Jack Parsons (that satanic rocket scientist, real life Tony Stark) opened a interdimensional gateway after a successful ritual named Babalon Working.

A few days later searching for more information on this subject I also came across a guy named Joe Jordan, author of a book named *Unholy Communion*, who basically was a MUFON researcher and ended up becoming a devout christian after meeting hundreds (600+ according to him) of people who were able to stop alien abductions (something said to be impossible to do) through prayer or by claiming the name of Jesus Chrisd and/or God.

I find this very interesting because it actually ties some knots that mixed occultism and ""aliens"", like the supposed nazi Vril Society and their ""channeling"" that made the german flying saucers possible.

It is worth noting that *allegedly* circa 1910 Aleister Crowley performed a satanic/occult ritual which [summoned a demon called LAM/Alamantrah](https://abrilsuperinteressante.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/alamantrah.jpg) that looked a whole lot like our modern ""grey alien"" and said to him something along the lines of ""today they call us angels and demons, but tomorrow they will call us something else"".

aliens,"I am not going to say where this occurred.. because the whole thing sounds ridiculous. But I was Dj'ing at an outdoor event in the downtown part of a city where I'm from.  It was for a cookie shop's grand opening and as I was Dj'ing I got approached by a group of people that looked WAYYY out of their element. Here's what I noticed first. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. They were all dressed from different time periods and they were all different aged. Let me explain.. it's as if they didn't know what to wear so they just found what they could wear from wherever. One guy was dressed Business Casual, another man looked homeless, another woman was wearing a church looking dress, and another lady looked straight out of the 80's. There was a grandma there (lookd mid 70's) and an older man, and a young girl (20-29), and a middle aged man (29-35) They were all so different from one another, it's like looking at a family where every member is adopted.. anyways.. shit get's weird. 
2. As they approach closer to me, they have this ""Spring"" in their step.. like they're gliding and dancing their way toward me. The Older grandma who looked like she was old as hell, was swiftly bouncing towards me.. and I realized whilst I watched her, ""WHAT THE HELL SHE'S DANCING!? Is that dancing!?"" Imagine an alien hiding in a human skin trying to move to music.. that's what it looked like. The other people started dancing with her as they walked toward me. When they got closer, I realized they all seemed soooo.. young? I knew I was looking at a grandma, but her vibrance and life was electric. No woman that old should be moving like that. It made no sense.. I was trying to calculate how someone like her could be so swift and move so quick.. it almost didn't look correct/right. I promise you, imagine a young girl around the age of 15 in a grandmas body.. it doesn't look natural. 
3. As they were dancing, they seemed so lost also.. they asked me where they were and I told them. Have you seen that video of Key and Peele when they're dancing to dubstep and they're like, ""WHAT IS THISS!!?""It was the same thing just based on geographical location. I was surprised they didn't know where they are as they were dancing and smiling, and the grandma was even jumping around. it made no sense. Then they asked for directions to a place I never heard of.. and I was like.., ""Umm... what?"" 
4. The weirdest part of this is they had this electrical feeling and their eyes seemed to radiate light or like a glow? It's super hard to explain.. it's almost like they were in their own sphere of reality experiencing or trying to experience a human experience. The whole thing was super bizarre. 
5. Oh one last thing.. is I never saw them get into a car, they came from one direction and left in another but I didn't see where they went.. I watched them walk away and then bam.. just gone. Didn't turn a corner or anything.. feels like when you blink and you miss something

Unsurprisingly, Google can't answer my questions.
Lets say they can travel 10000 faster than the speed of light. That's a little bit faster than the transwarp speed of the fastest ship in Star Trek. With that speed it would still take about 250 years to reach the nearest galaxy. If we dare to dream we would need a craft capable of traveling 10 million times faster than the speed of light, to be able to travel to other galaxies in reasonable time spans, which is lets say one year.",Do we have any idea about the interstellar speed of UFO crafts?

1. She doesn’t think that there is anywhere else in the universe that has all the perfect requirements to sustain life. 
My response was that this is a very naive view, Earth has the requirements for life AS WE KNOW IT. There could be millions of other places that sustain other forms of life, outside of what we know to be a requirement (oxygen, water etc)

2. The size of space was a big debate. After watching the recent Genesis documentary, space is described as a blanket stretched across “the universe” in the bible.
I believe that space is incredibly vast, and more akin to the ocean but unlimited in its expanse. We know what we have discovered, but so much is the unknown.

3. I have looked into the Anunnaki, and if anything I believe our “god” to be one of these celestial beings. Of course this was scoffed at, as there is “only one god” etc

aliens,"A group of Italians in the '50s make friends with a group of aliens who they call the W56 friends.

Overall the story seems outlandish, absurd, and honestly stupid. This coincides with Jacque Vallee's theory of the absurdity of encounters, benchmarks, and control mechanisms - we can't comprehend their end goal for us as a civilization.

Basically, they are not studying us. They know more about us than we as humans know about ourselves. According to the video, and writings, we are being guided into their philosophy and overall culture - which has been pretty hard for them. Their culture mirrors heavily on Jesus' teachings, basically love one another and take care of each other. But not just as a community but in every aspect of human endeavor, for example, technology.

Technology is very important for them, and their morals determine their technology. It's not just a means to reach an end.

Segway to UFOs, their crafts are not just tech, but a manifestation of their moral code - like if it were their temple. This is one of the reasons why they show them off and permit people to see them. To show what they have achieved with a morally based tech. Their craft is programmed to cause no harm. (Although there are others who have other intentions)

Also, their beliefs seem so outlandish to us that all interactions with them seem absurd - from a human perspective. They have a set of control mechanisms that are set that way for interacting with us because of how humans are. (no idea why)

Lou commented about the book Chains of Sea, a book where aliens are in contact with a sentient AI created by humans. But in the case of W56, the sentient AI is not from earth. And they are here to cause harm and conflict. According to them, the AI started just as a human civilization that took a wrong turn in the advancement of their technology. And the AI nourishes from conflict for some reason.

There an encounter in Mexico where a person says he had made friends with aliens, and he also calls them ""my friends."" The whole premise of this interaction is quite identical to the Italian one and equally absurd. Then there's another encounter in Brazil, where the UFOs where very artisanal in nature and the aliens gave off an extremely hippie vibe. Their tech and morals coincided with the Italian W56.

And they now just extraterrestrials, they are also from other dimensions. And some Italians from the W56 considered then more humans and humans. ""They had more humanness."" Which might coincide with Lou's comment on there being more than one ""human race.""

I will add, that do to their philosophy might explain the hippie vibe at the end of unidentified the show.

I will go as for to speculate that Cmdr. Fravor was chosen to witness the UFO do to his moral, and life experience makeup. Loyalty, family, and friendship. As Jacque Vallee had said before their control mechanisms, and that there are ways to activate it.

Story Time:

Ok so here goes the story. My friend and I went to a local bar the other night. We live in a small town where everyone knows each other and it’s the usual regulars on the weekend. My friend and I noticed two fellows we didn’t know that were obviously from out of town. 

Some ladies started chatting us up and this is what caused the trouble from the P.E.s (Potential Extra terrestrials). The P.Es were obviously upset with this and came over to confront us (perhaps they were interested in studying our females insides or taking them back to conduct some type of research at their spaceship?). The ladies told us that the two guys had been bothering them all night and were weirdos. After the two P.Es came over we tried making small talk. They had an off putting demeanor about them and they lacked a lot of basic social skills. It was a painfully almost robotic conversation but I did my best to diffuse the situation. There was something strange about them that I just can’t put my finger on. They both had sunken in eyes and pale skin and just looked kinda sickly. I kinda shrugged it off and figured they were just nerds or intoxicated.

I tried to keep the conversation going and we found out that they were both supposedly aircraft mechanics for Space X? I found this kind of odd and questioned to myself why they we’re in our small rural town. The two guys were still visually upset with us and started picking a fight (perhaps they wanted to study our combat styles?). I ordered another beer when I looked over and one of the P.Es had their slimy alien hands on my buddy. I quickly leaped up and came to his aid. I got him off my buddy and landed a few blows to his alien face. The bar tender broke the scuffle up and the two P.Es quickly fled the scene (was he maybe trying to hide his alien blood or afraid of blowing their cover?). 

My friend and I left the bar and recounted how strange the whole incident was. This is where stuff starts to get really weird. We woke up the next day a little hung over and weird stuff has been happening since. My friend had some glass cups come flying out of his cupboards and smash (like a poltergeist or something?). 

Then it happened I had a very crazy and very real UFO encounter. A bright light shined through my window while I was watching a movie. I ran outside to see a low flying UFO hovering over my house!!! It had strange rigging and lights and then disappeared before I could get a picture. 

We’re they just weird guys or shapeshifting life forms from another planet sent here to study us? Did we beat up some alien ass nibbas and they’re pissed at us now? If anyone has any experience making peace with getting other worldly beings please let me know.

If you don’t hear from me again I probably got abducted or worse. I’ve never been much of a believer but the past events have been some of the strangest things I’ve had happen to me.

However, the possibility we have been visited by creatures of greater intelligence has always stumped me, yet I would like to believe they are out there. Since I was a child I was fascinated by anything do to with space. Now I don't remember the exact date but I do remember I was about 9-10 years old at the time (I'm now 20) and I was out my Grandparents backyward it was around 10pm, and I was watching the sky when I saw 3 brights lights not to far up but closer to me then I'd like, they zoomed around and then formed a triangle like shape and shot off and disappeared. That was the first and only ""encounter"" I had happen. I remember that moment like it was yesterday I ran as fast as I could back and into the house. My grandparents looked at me like I'd seen a ghost but I couldn't find the words to describe what I saw at the time so I let it go, but I never forgot. Even today I think back and try to say ""was it all in my head, a child's imagination?"" yet when I found this reddit, I saw others had the same exact experience, and thought maybe, just maybe it was something more, something I was trying desperately to prove wrong, but why? Now with all these Pentagon videos being confirmed true, right as Corona happened?  ( yes I'm aware UFO doesn't mean alien) how sightings are seen more and more recently. The possible sign of life of Venus, the tasks forces being made by the Pentagon and Japan? are they planning to reveal something? Why now after all these years of nothing? maybe it's easier with Corona, as when it did happen it was pushed under the rug because Corona was all that was there. I do believe it should be bigger news. Friends and family just don't seem to care as much as me. probably think I'm crazy to believe all of this, that maybe just maybe we have been visited by other beings, I've read about the roswell incident but everyone I know trys to tell me it was fake. I use to watch those alien abduction videos as a child, even now, I use to think they were crazy, but now I believe that someone somewhere could be telling the truth. What do you guys think, the UFO's could be government tech, but surely that can't be any better, they're defying physics, I'd be scared with governments with that kind of technology.

Dozens of high ranking veterans, politicians, cops, even billionaires and other credible sources have claimed to have some evidence showing that there's something to unexplained UFOs, including many that have said they've been sharing alien technology for decades.

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/.../alien-technology...](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/09/alien-technology-shared-or-massive.html?fbclid=IwAR0ji8_EOe_98omeA7gixUSvoB3NXEk3BDwqPRwxYKKVZb43aK7gUwFo6CU)

This means that either there's something to it or there's a massive intentional effort to make it seem true, even if it isn't. The mainstream media hardly reports any of this and on the few occasions that they do cover it, they treat with ridicule, instead of rational review. In many cases, the so-called skeptics make more absurd claims than the believers, although some believers clearly are going way to far.

&amp;#x200B;

This should be looked at scientifically with a reasonable amount of rational skepticism, but not closed minded skepticism or ridicule.

Why would politicians, multimillionaires or billionaires risk their reputations or fortunes to make these claims?

Furthermore, there's an enormous amount of evidence which skeptics can't address that provides partial support, including an enormous number of UFO sightings, megaliths that shouldn't have been possible to move with ancient technology, crop circles, cattle mutilations, and even alien abductions, even if most of the reporting on this has credibility problems.

In most cases the best evidence is often mixed in with false information, which may be intentional. So a good researcher has to keep an open mind, while being reasonably skeptical of some of it.

September has seen several UFO Sighting footage videos come out of the UTICA, NY State area.  If these are flares or not, there is definitely something interesting going on there.

We wouldn't normally post a video where the resemblance to flares is quite high - but for the fact yesterday we talked a lot in the comments about shaky &amp; crappy footage is so widespread in UFO recordings, given today's technology - and how frustrating it is; but from the viewpoint of the public, and excited first-time witnesses to something they feel is out of the ordinary in the sky - well today's video is a great example.

It's 4 lights high up, look a lot like flares, yet no smoke trails from them, they stay very stationary for over 8 minutes.

aliens,"""If aliens came, we would be enslaved like europeans did to indigenous people""  
""They would be like colombus""  
""We would be harvested""   
These are very common misconceptions I've seen repeated in movies and even by scientists, but this is not only a flawed logic, but also a misunderstanding of history.  
Let's start with the latter: Why did we really end slavery?  
Believe it or not, it's not because we were compassionate towards the slaves, the real reason is because slavery is economically inefficient.   
Let's start with the slaver owner perspective, as a slave owner you have to buy your slaves and if they die or flee the next day, your money went to the garbage, so you have to take care of them, feed them and but you also have to make sure they work. And they're not gonna work as hard as they can, or smart, they're no incentive besides survival. And even then your profit is not guaranteed.  
Compare that to a business owner, he just has to pay less than his profit. And if anything happens to his employee, he can just hire someone else.  
Now what about society? Most of the time with slavery you have a stagnant society, because the market is more limited. There's less incentive for enterpreneuring or improving anything, less competition, it's just a garbage system overall. Why would a species with a much bigger intelect and superior technology have such system?  
Now here's the real flawed logic: What would they gain from enslaving us in the first place? If they have the technology to travel light years and keep coming to earth without people noticing, what could we possibly offer to a type 2/3 civilization?   
Meat? They could clone any species and eat as much as they want.  
Agriculture? They could terraform any exoplanet.   
Working? They can have robots or AI. Humans are already worried about AI taking all the jobs, can you imagine aliens?   
There's nothing we can offer them but this: knowledge about our species.   
Thinking we would be like indigenous people is incredibly arrogant, indigenous people just didn't have the knowledge. We are more like the dumbest primates.",Common misconception about alien invasions

aliens,"hello, first post here.

Around early June , I went to a camp site in Divide, Colorado with my girlfriend's family. It was my first time camping (20yo) and there were about 25 of her family members there. I was originally going to drive back down to CO Springs because I just wanted to go for a few hours, however I decided to drink a little.

Fast forward to the fun part, it was around 11pm and everyone is have fun and drinking though it's not like we were getting shit faced, just having a good time. We decide to away from the RVs and lights so we can look at the stars. We hang out in the woods for a bit and we aren't really looking up anymore until one of my girlfriend's cousins says ""hey guys look at that star"". All six of us that were out there look up and we all see the same thing:

A star brightening up only to have it spilt in 3, of which all three points *stars* move counterclockwise away from each other in a rather spiral path. I'm trying to explain this as best as I can.

All six of us saw the same thing, I few ran back to the camp but I stayed out in awe.

I looked for what feels like 5 minutes and they are still there, moving here and there and then stopping in place for a moment. My girlfriend and I return to the camp site and grab other people to come and look, we all lay on the ground and start watching the sky.

Stars everywhere but these 3 are still there, bright and moving. Then we see more coming in all directions, moving, disappearing, glowing, and even changing directions.

I was not drunk, none of us were and we try to record but our cameras can't even focus on the moon.

This was 45 minutes of watching stars behave the way they shouldn't. I have the app heavens above to see if any satellites would be visible. None were passing over head. I looked at air traffic websites and no planes in the area and at that time. Plus this was still during the closure phased of my state. I doubted there could have been that many planes up in the sky. And EVEN if there were that doesn't explain the constant 90° turns or complete turn arounds of the objects. 

This was my first time ever seeing anything like this. I was super excited and I still think about that night hoping that they heard/felt us and said ""let's give these guys a show.""

aliens,"Hi everyone, I'm taking a weekend trip to the San Luis valley, and I started my journey near the sand dunes. I went during the day to a couple of places that were supposed to be good for seeing UFOs but didn't see any during the day. 

I returned in the night, parked at the Zapata Falls entrance and was just watching the sky. I thought I saw a few UFOs very high up and far away, as well as several shooting stars, but the big one happened near the end. 

I saw a group of lights very close together in a row and very low to the horizon, towards the sand dunes. It looked like the lights from one larger saucer shaped ship and it looked like it was spinning for awhile, just based in hoe the lights were moving. It flashed yellow and green, and sometimes red. I watched it stay along the horizon for awhile, moving at a slow, steady pace. I was standing outside of my car and then I thought I felt something crawl onto my foot so I got back into my car. I thought it would be gone but after some searching I found it again.

It got further away but still along the horizon, hovering but sort of dipping up and down over the same spot, going a little bit forwards and backwards but mostly just staying at the same spot. It wasn't gaining too much altitude and I am not entirely sure if I was seeing it correctly or not, but it definitely looked like it was moving. I watched it do this for awhile and then left. At one point I saw a small red light dart near it and disappear. I checked back after I'd driven down the road for awhile and it was gone. 

I unfortunately was unable to capture a picture or video of it, but it will stand out to me as one or the most compelling pieces of evidence that I have witnessed to prove to myself that extraterrestrials actually exist.

aliens,"  So there was a period of my life that was very, very strange, which leads up to a few recent strange events. I'll try to cover everything I remember in chronological order as best I can. 

So when I was a child, we lived in a white house in a small town, in a neighborhood with lots of neighbors. My brother and I slept on a bunkbed and each of us slept well without any problems.  
My mother took care of each of us as a single mom and worked hard and we lived moderately well. My mother eventually got a good job with her degree and we moved into a new house that was about 30 minutes away from the old one. The new house was a tall yellow house that I will call the ""yellow house"". Once we moved, things got a little weird.

The yellow house was located in the country, and we really only had one neighbor. The neighbor had a completely fenced in yard and was a decent distance away. There were fields surrounding the house on every side, with high hills, placing the house at the bottom of a sort of ""bowl"" of hills on every side. The reason I mention the terrain in detail is because there could have been an army of unicorns next to our house and no one would have ever seen it. We were isolated from view at any angle. From what I've gathered on the subject, most abductions occur in rural areas, and this house was the definition of rural.

I was around 9 years old when we moved to the yellow house, my mom was a religious person and at the time, she had had only one experience of the paranormal, it was a UFO sighting that her and her dad had seen years ago at night, she described it to me later as an array of lights. She wasn't into aliens or paranormal things though. She was just a normal, orthodox christian type person.

When we moved to the yellow house the first strange event that happened was my brother seemingly sleepwalking. We would fall asleep in the bunkbed, upstairs, and my brother would wake up the next morning downstairs on the couch, or on the floor. This in itself wasn't that odd. Sleepwalking happens. As time went on I developed an intense fear of going to bed. I would try to go to sleep but would for some reason be absolutely terrified that someone was going to walk into the room. This went on for about a year and got to the point where I was sleeping outside my moms door freaking out for hours before falling asleep. There was one point where I recall laying outside her door, with everyone in bed, and hearing the front door open downstairs. I jumped up and ran into her room panicking.

Eventually I learned to manage the fear and slept more easily. But it was still very difficult and I would often stay up longer than intended because I just couldnt fall asleep. The fear was very specific, I just feared that someone would open the door to my room and come in, that was it. 

One day, about 4 or 5 years after we had moved to the yellow house, my mom and I were watching the old netflix movies that used to come by mail. We decided to make some popcorn, or cookies, I cant remember wich. I looked out the kitchen window to the field outside and saw what looked like a flashlight shining on some blue fabric, the light turned off very quickly when I saw it and I immediately felt fear. I told my mom in a frantic voice. I was so terrified that she believed me and also became uneasy. After a while she rationalized that I had just been staring at screens too much and just imagined/hallucinated it. 

 Around age 15 I started to develop an odd hallucination of colored geometry that was very faint, in the center of my vision. It was very, very faint, but it was there. I would look at it when falling asleep sometimes, and eventually it lead me to a very strange ability. If I laid down and stared at this weird anomaly for a while, I would go into sleep paralysis. Now at night time, I fucking hate sleep paralysis. Its scary. But if I entered sleep paralysis during the day, the fear was kind of diminished, and I thought that this weird state was kind of intriguing.

I started experimenting with sleep paralysis during the day. I learned to enter it with ease, and how to wake myself from it if need be. I never ever did it at night, because it would sometimes cause mild hallucinations which I couldnt handle at night. In sleep paralysis I figured out how to transition my state into a lucid dream. The process would go as follows: Lie down, enter sleep paralysis, and then I would either sort of wiggle myself out of my body, or just slip out of it kind of automatically. The trick was to not freak out so that I wouldnt wake myself up. 

The first lucid dream I had was mind blowing to me. I was in my bed around 7 O clock evening time in summer. I go into paralysis, and I rolled over and it felt like I had rolled out of my body. Suddenly I could see that I was riding on a razor scooter down the road outside my house. It looked completely real and in my head I was thinking, holy shit, Im in my bed right now. I ended up getting off the scooter and walking into the field, which looked like the real field, nothing was changed. Trees were in the same spot, etc. I wondered what I could do in this new weird realm so I thought I would try to jump as high as I could, so I jumped and shot up about 30 feet.  I could see the ground below me and as I hit the apex of my jump I started to fall. I started falling pretty fast and it scared me that I was going to hit the ground and suddenly I was back in my bed. I was immensely excited about what had just happened.

Still to this day I see the geometric patterns faintly in my vision, always. I am not schizophrenic, I have a good job, and a great social life. I do not have any mental disorders. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I am certain that without the patterns, I wouldnt be able to easily enter sleep paralysis and the subsequent lucid dream. It is an amazing ability that I wish everyone had. I've tried to teach some people the method but have had no success in doing so.

A month or so after I learned this, I was in the front yard and a black car that looked sort of like an unmarked cop car slowed to a stop in front of the house, a guy rolled down the window, and took a picture (with flash on) of me. I was sincerely confused on what the fuck he was doing. Still don't have a clue but its weird.

Anyway you might be wondering how the lucid dreaming thing connects with abduction. Well, I'm not completely certain that it is connected. But I think that it might be. My mother eventually told me of her experience at the yellow house. One day my brother and I were not at the house and she was watching a netflix movie, and each window of the house filled with white light, and suddenly 3 hours had passed. She had no recollection of the missing time, and her movie had finished, with her not knowing what had happened in the movie. She got up and from what she told me, the mirror had 4 fingered hand prints on it. She told me that after that day, she was so freaked out that she had to take xanax to go to sleep for a month.

The reason I decided to make this post is because after I moved out of the yellow house I have had no weird events happen. Until a few weeks ago. I came home from work one night and became ill when I walked into my house. I felt very compelled to go to sleep so I did, with my clothes still on. The next morning I woke up feeling fine, but there was a small amount of blood on my door frame and a weird mark near my stomach. 

None of this proves that I was abducted but it does point in that direction in my opinion.  My mom and recent step dad moved out of the house because my step dad thought that it was haunted. 

Thats about it for the series of strange shit thats happened in my life. Thanks for reading. Take it for what you will.

aliens,"It’s fair to say that the UFO phenomenon on earth is real but are UFO’s also observed in space? I’ve never really heard of anything like this mentioned. We have thousands of people looking into space everyday yet no one seems to see anything. Satellites scanning the cosmos daily and again they never find anything. If UFO’s are aliens for a distant world in theory they would have to travel here somehow, so how can they travel to earth completely undetected yet once they are here we can pick them up on radar.

aliens,,"Police blocked off roads, 4 videos. not my video"
aliens,"Do you believe it is possible to be followed by a certain ALIEN for a while due to their own interpretation of our emotion called ""love""/attraction?

The reason i bring this up is because most alien encounters by many are just observational.
What if there is something that would be their veraion of that emotion?

They say the aliens are too advanced to have emotions but what if they are trying to have that emotion or at the very least what if by accident thwy figured out why ""love"" or attraction is IMPORTANT to their progress in some way?

I mean a genuine attraction like they like the individual but is not at all like our human version of physical attraction.

OBVIOUSLY they would NOT be physically attracted to us...but maybe in other ways?

I mean if they are smart would they not find intelligence attractive? 

Also, as I have heard, aliens are very sexual. . .
What if they (maybe) long for something beyond the sexual aspect.

I have heard outlandish stories of alien human romance and some very believable instances of passionate encounters that are something new for both the alien and human.

My question to you all is: do you believe a human and alien could be so intertwined in some way that they keep track of eachother in some way?

For example: when I was young i had this dream in which i was the age of like 4 (unlike my experience) and me and this older attractive woman were just in this place. Just us two. But it was sexual. The place was weird but she definitely expressed fondness. 
It was a dream because the background kept changing (in this dream.) I believe she was an alien because she looked like a human but there was something about her.

It was just us two.

Ive had a similar dream at other places with different scenery. (Maybe the alien is trying to figure out what I find attractive?)

I had a few others.

In the dreams, both of us were kind of just cuddling and enjoying each others company. There was a sexual aspect but not always. Its unexplainable.","""ALIENS"" + Human 'Romance'?"

OK, that out the way...

**Odessa** is a well populated region on the coast of the Black Sea, in the Ukraine; and has been quite a hot spot for UFO sightings for several years now, many of which involve objects that either disappear into the ocean, or ascend out of the ocean.

This sighting footage was submitted last night (**details below**) and at first glance we were inclined to give it a pass rather than feature it, as it is very shaky, very grainy, and initially is just another light in the sky - but it is what happens towards the end of the segment which really intrigued us.

After making a dash to the right, it turns and dashes to the left, before looking like, for all intents and purposes, firing up some kind of energy field; as it changes into a central bright object with a less opaque aura around it, also spherical - and then vanishes.

What if the microbial life we possibly discovered on Venus is ours

So recently I heard the exciting news that we possibly discovered microbial extraterrestrial life in the clouds of the planet Venus. It’s exciting to hear but my question is, is that life from Venus? 

In the 1960s the Soviet Union sent multiple missions to the surface of Venus with probes, 

nearly all of them burned up in the atmosphere, 

but what if some bacteria hitched a ride on the Soviet spaceships and jumped off while it was going through the atmosphere, 

and in the past 60 years has been reproducing in the clouds and taking over the atmosphere.



Is it possible that the life that we might find is not Venusian life but Russian bacteria?

aliens,"i feel like a vast majority of sci-fi entertainment portrays humanoid aliens, some even looking almost identical to humans. this causes most people to imagine aliens as extremely human-like, considering pretty much every portrayal of aliens they see look like that. however, considering that even most species on earth are aren’t humanoid, what are the chances that aliens are? and then take into account that they’re living in a completely different environment, how likely is it that what’s evolutionary beneficial for us is also good for them? i’m pretty sure the reason that entertainment does that is just because they have to work with human actors, or at least up until recently and now we’re pretty much stuck with it. granted i do see some interesting designs more recently, but i feel like this will forever effect the public’s perception of aliens. what do you guys think about humanoid aliens, and the trope of the green martian? how do y’all feel about the entertainment industry’s portrayal of aliens? or just anything else i said lol.",thoughts on non-humanoid aliens?

aliens,"So a few years back I had an experience, and it's something that's bothered me since. I can't say for sure what it was, be it paranormal, alien, or just human in nature but it's something I want to put out there to see if anyone else has had similar experiences. It's also not something I can shrug off and say I imagined because it also effected two other people. 

So I was maybe somewhere between 18-20 at the time, and I had a friend staying over for the night. I will also say that I live in a small town in the UK, an ex coal mining turned 'market' town. Bit of a shithole, really. It was about 2am and we went to the local 24 hour supermarket. We left and began walking home, and across the road from said supermarket was an empty lot. At the time, they were filming this popular old fashioned TV show on the towns front street, so this lot was littered with Trailers, Vans, Caravans etc. We were walking past and it's silent. Dead. Not a soul around. We walk past and the side faces of these trailers just lit up a bright blue. Think a police cars light. I thought we got crept up on by a police car because two teens walking around at night, sure. I get it. I turn around and nothing's there. No cars, no people, nothing in the direction this light came from that could possibly put out THAT much light. I look to my friend and we just shrug it off, just some weird thing.   


Not more than 3 minutes later, at the top of my street, the sides of several houses again lit up a bright blue. We spin around quick this time and again, nothing. 2am, it's silent, there's no cars, people, helicopters, planes, nothing. Freaking out a little bit we get back to mine and that was it until a few days later.   


I woke up around 9am and went downstairs to grab food and my mother was in the kitchen looking exhausted. Soon as she sees me she begins throwing a fit asking what I was doing at 4am, and I quote ""the bright blue light from my room lit up the entire hallway from the gap underneath my door and woke her up so she couldn't get back down."".

Aliens that came to our earth a while back centuries and centuries ago have acquired the elevated consciousness related to the type of energy located in Indigo children or light workers. The aliens in having this heightened awareness produced a goal to spread this energy to as many living organisms as possible trying to make everything that lives and exists acquire a collective aware consciousness, so to do this they spread their third eye DNA to humans by breeding with them and in turn created us light workers (human/alien hybrids) that have passed this energy down generations by generations. Doing this, in the end, would create a super society like a united universe linking different planets and solar systems with our woke energy where in turn could push for conquering existence itself.

## On August 15th, 1977, Jerry R. Ehman was working on a project at the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University when he picked up a strong narrowband radio signal that many believe to prove the existence of aliens. The signal lasted the full 72 second window that the Big Ear was able to observe it, but it has never been detected again.The signal was within the band of radio frequencies where transmissions are internationally banned on Earth. Furthermore, natural sources of radiation from space usually cover a wider range of frequencies. It is thought to have come from almost 220 million light years away and the signal bore the expected hallmarks of non-terrestrial origin, but there are also many doubts that the signal was a sign of intelligent extraterrestrial origin. to this day scientists are still confused how a signal that powerful could come from so far away in the universe without the aid of advanced technology, and this led Ehman to circled it on the readout and wrote “Wow!”. The signal still remains unexplained.

I saw that happen in some really depressing arguments in the comments sections to the posting I made earlier today, and given this daft 'Outrage Culture' we find ourselves stuck in, in 2020, why not just leave it out of an internet forum like this? If you have nothing useful to offer, whether constructive or critical, save it for yelling at the cat when it next pees on your bed, please?

Other thing, when I encourage comments and opinions, how about opening a discussion? Why answer with ""It's a bird"", ""Drone"", ""crappy weather balloon footage"", ""a plane""...  Is that it..?  Come on, does it make your day to comment that? Offer up your reasons for saying it !!!!!!!

Seriously, think about it. We humans love to travel, and whether its a matter of integrating into mixed-species societies (a la Star Wars) or just attempting to homestead new worlds, what if the FTL technology is so ""doable"" that it will quickly reach the masses and after that, all bets are off. Economies would collapse if millions of people were to decide to give it a shot at any of the billions of stars in our galaxy. No more wealth for the 1%, and they lose their ""serfs"" (us).

aliens,Remember when crop circles were all the rage ? Then it was proven to be people using wooden boards and rope. That was disappointing. Crop circles were one of the biggest mysteries of modern times and were often linked to aliens or ufos. I was curious how people in this sub thought crop circles were created by aliens before the truth came out. For example when I first learned of crop circles as a kid I immediately assumed that they were imprints left from alien ships that had landed on Earth. Was this a common belief or were there other theories that seemed more logical to anyone here?,Crop Circles
aliens,"Hello,

This memory is from when I was 16
 I am 29 now 
I can remember this day like It was yesterday 
I have told friends about it but when I saw their reaction
I just never mentioned it again. 
I lived with my parents and older brother in a private house 
Which is pretty much a house with two apartments 1st and 2nd floor, we were on the 2nd floor time was 2-3pm 
It was only me and my mother she was in the kitchen cleaning and getting ready to cook dinner 
I was in my room playing a video game via online with a  friend ...my computer chair and tv is 2ft away from the door .. my room is connect to my parents room and that room connects to the living room ...that living room has a hallway that leads to the kitchen which is connected to another bedroom  that hallway is connected to a bathroom and a storage room.. the entrance and exit is located in the living room.. the position I was in if I was to look to my left I can see the door that leads to the living room connected to my parents bedroom through that door I felt a presence it felt so strong but yet again so emotionless 
I wasn't scared but alert as I'm staring at that doorway I can hear my friend on the headset yelling as I continue to stare his yelling faded away and once I noticed the tunnel vision I was in the amount of focus I felt my self having
 that's when a metallic rod  slowly revealed it's self it was moving in to my parents room from the living room .. the shape of it was a long rectangle rod about 3inches wide and 3-4 ft in length as it slowly continued to reveal it's self and it's hieroglyphics on it .. which felt like the signs on it were electronically lite no pulse but singular wave form a very observant presence and when it got to about 3-4 ft and it just stood there  staring at me . As I notice the glowing signs were not like i have ever seen before and it looked just like what I have seen in alien related movies my heart rate raised at this moment it stopped moving and stood perfectly still it didn't move about 5 ft from the floor 4 ft in to the room which felt like it had more length to it .. once I felt I knew what I was looking at and confirmed 
I got overwhelmed and looked away toward my tv 
And I can still see from my peripheral and I didn't see it but felt it .. when I look back.. it was gone I no longer saw it physically nor felt it's presence I stood perfectly still in my chair staring at the same spot processing what happen and slowing I started to hear the game in my headset and my friend talking .. once I regained my self I quickly removed the headset and  headed to that spot and there's nothing i walked to the kitchen and asked my mother if she had left the kitchen recently she replied I have been here for about 30mins.. I walked to the entrance / exit door and open and checked down the stairs and nothing no presence nothing ... I walked back to my room and sat in the chair for about 2mins thinking how crazy that was asking my self was it real am I dreaming .. when I look at the tv I notice my friend left the chat and left me a message that he had to get off.  After that I continued playing by myself untill dinner was ready around 7 and everyone was home got my plate went back to my room eat .. after that just went to sleep . And woke up the next day to my friends playing baseball in the backyard I quickly got ready and went back there and asked my friend about the games we played the day before and he confirmed how good we were doing and what we did to win .. that's when I knew I wasn't dreaming ... What was that !!!! ???",A metal rod with hieroglyphics
aliens,"I ran across this story online... does anyone have more information on this?


The Evolution of Vicious Mammalian Preditors has occurred millions of years in the Past. The Survival of the fittest has been the way of Mammalian Preditors on Sirius. As the many Millions of years progressed the Vicious Mammalian Preditors Evolved with the help of Divine Intervention from the Ancient Kods to become Humanoids. These Mammalian Preditors Evolved to Walk on Two Legs but retained their Canus Ancestry of Wolfen Heritage.

These Mammalian Preditors became the Teeth of Sirius. The Empire of Sirius was Born. The ways of Battle was with them. In time Sirius became a Powerful Empire of the Mighty Barker ( The Mighty Dog Star ). The Mammalian Preditors Technologies Evolved also and as they became more Advanced their Ambition to Stretch their Interest further became apparent.

Devotion to the Canus Kings was absolute , anything less would mean Death. The Dak were the Destroyers ( The Dogs ) , their Star Ships were Unstoppable Conqouring all neighbouring Planets. Many Starsystems fell to the Wolf Packs of Sirius and the Canus Kings were pleased. It was said that the Wolfen Warriors were renown for Eating the Flesh of their Enemies like a Pack of Ravenous Wolves without Mercy.

Loyalty to Sirius and the Empire was Job 1. Billions of Years Created a Species on Sirius that was a Pack Hunting being perfect Soldiers they were.

As the Wolfen Warriors started to enter the Pesh ma ten Super Galaxy highway the Canus Ships attacked the Orion Reptilian Ships. The Canus Warriors finally found worthy opponents in the MK Reptilian Warriors.
The Reptilian Warriors underestimated the Power and Ruthlessness of the Canus Mammalian Warriors and on a Planet on the Outskirts of Orion the Enemy Party Ships Landed and they Pitted their Best Warriors in a Fight to the Death to see just who was Strongest.

The Best Canus Warriors vs the Best Reptilian Warriors. The battles were truly Vicious , truly Gruesome , and truly Unbelievable.The Strongest Most Vicious Wolfen Warrior showed Incredible Power and Ferociousness that took the Best Reptilian Warrior off gaurd by underestimating the Ferocious Teeth of Sirius the first Fights were Dominated by the Wolves. It was a See Saw battle to the Death between to Rival Groups, at one time it was the Wolfen Warriors that were Victorious against the Reptiles and at other turns it would be the Reptilian Elite Warriors Slashing the Canus Warriors with their Razor Sharp Accuracy Claws to Death. Martial Arts was not Invented by Humans only copied , Martial Arts was around millions of years before.

These Battles would Extend to Space to see just who had the Military Muscle in the Heavens. Big Massive Spaceships battling each other for Dominance.

The Serpent Queens couldn't take this Powerful Rival Empire anymore because many of the Reptilian Armies were getting Destroyed. The Serpent Queens had to send Ambassadors to the Canus Kings for a Treaty to prevent a Gruesome War between the Mammals and the Reptiles.
Deals were many and Military Might was displayed among these Meetings. Orion showed their Mighty Weapons of War. Their Best and most powerful of all Weapons was their Star Destroyer Weapon which was able to blow up Suns/Stars.

The Canus Kings were spectators of this Incredible Weapon of War by the Orion Empire able to Blow Up Suns. The Canus Kings were Humbled by such an Incredible Weapon of War.
They Quickly Understood that Battling the Orion Empire could mark the Destruction of the Sirius Star Systems and offered their Services to the Throne of the Orion Queens.
A Deal was made by King Al al. Prince Anu's Uncle.

And so it was after all this Carnage between Sirius &amp; Orion that a Peace Deal was made that would benefit the people Sirius and Orion. Great Prosperity was Born between the Two Empires and both Empires experienced a Prosperity like never before seen in their Histories.

Together the Two Empires were not matched. Not even by Alpha Draconis or any other Foreign Empire. Their Influence was Unchallenged and they Governed the Pesh ma ten Super Star Highways , Foreigners would pay tolls to run the Super highway.

United the Colonies of Sirius &amp; Orion formed the Annunaki Colonies. Colonies of Reptilian &amp; Wolfen Heritage together they mixed Forming the Annunaki. This was going on before the Ape and before Man was even Created. This was the Age of the Heroes of Old , Warriors of Renown. Warriors of Mammalian and Reptilian Heritage.",Reptile wolf battle ages ago..
aliens,"  I live in the quite neighborhood in Eugene, Oregon for twenty five years now. I always thought about talking about it for some time now, but most people wouldn’t take me seriously. I am speaking from the bottom of my heart so please take this seriously.                                      
   On the first two weeks of moving in, things were quite nice. I would always wake up to a bird chirping or a bright sun. Things were really quite and nice. Too quite. It wasn’t until a day later. I was staying up late with a coffee in my hand one night and reading a book. All of a sudden I hear a weird hum up above. I looked up and then out of the window to find nothing there. I shook it off until I heard another one, but this time louder. I went outside and caught a glimpse of what appeared to be some kind of black rectangle in the distance. It flew really far and disappeared by the time I saw it. Neighbors around have shared similar stories, and ever since I can’t really make up of what it was. I would like to see if anyone had a similar experience, and remember, you’ll never see the same ufo twice.",Keep hearing weird noises in our neighborhood.
aliens,"I find it strange and compelling with all the reach I’ve done, how research in psychology can relate to aliens, articles that will speak about emotions and the role on our physical body. How fear can control and freeze us. Fear can control like how the greys use fear to stop they’re victims dead in their tracks in lots encounters. Make them unable to move with fear some people even say like a wave of fear. humans produce emotional energy. Which can be measured and be detected with Technology as common as house hold routers and the Wi-Fi in our homes.  Good article by Harvard on that. The greys must use some sort of emotional mastery of energy to use fear because it’s so wired into humans. Our fight or flight response. So they can control us when need be with it. In the book behold a pale horse it talks about how to break free from a greys control with happy pleasant thoughts because it confuses them. Our emotions produce a energy or Residency of some sort. That supposedly the reptilian race feeds off of from a higher up dimension. The main energies of lust, and sexual energy, what the Bible considers sin, but also hate and fear. That demotion being the astral plane where the Reptilians feed off of us. Some say a higher plane then that but I doubt so. They keep us away when our bodies naturally start to slip into the plane through sleep paralysis. By scaring us, showing us what we fear to keep us out of their plane of existence where they feed on us. Because sleep paralysis and astro projection are on the same plane and thing. Sleep Paralysis is the in unpurposeful projection. I think the demons and begins that sit on our chest and scare us do it on purpose but for what reason? To keep us away. Again back to fear. We fear to go and we stay away. We have become a race of physical minded people. We don’t see Astroprojection as a place or Reality anymore. More of a dream and forget about the experience. Rationalize it. We’re 2/3 physical an 1/3 spiritual now. When Thousands of years ago even hundreds of years ago. We were more interconnected with our spiritual selfs. But now we are desensitized to it. What is real is only physical real life if you well. Reality is only what you can see an touch we are taught. Why would that be again to keep us blind and unaware. Unaware to our spiritual selfs and unaware of being used. There’s so much more to all of this and these are only simple connections just off the top of my head something I just want to get out and see what others think or see these connections as well. It’s hard to explain and I see so many that I can’t even try to explain them all. Like the god particle or the ether. That Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein, talked about a Non-physical ether. And in the nature volume some time in 1970s  they published a test where they proved that there is a Nonphysical source of energy or realm. The god particle. The ether. The Astro plane it’s non physical. Not touchable. We can prove that there are places other then physical reality. But we’re not taught that. But it does exists and it has been proven and published. It’s not talked about. The connections. The more I learn the more I see them. Even with cell phone towers and our emotional energy and states of being. I’ve read cia documents talking about how they could induce Astroprojection with frequency played aloud auditory beats/ remote viewing. I’ve read cia document where they hide cell phone towers as trees in the 60s and when asked what they were for they said for State of emergency control over the mass population. They would produce frequencies to calm everybody. If anyone knows that document send me it I lost it but it’s real. Tesla said that if you wish to understand the Universe think of it in energy, Frequency , and vibration. With dmt and Astro projection we all have states of Physical and spiritual separation. physical and spiritual separation. Followed with vibrations. Both auditory and felt physically. I just think theres too many coincidences, not to be all inner connected. If you see connections like this in your research message me or comment what you’ve found.","The strange inter connection between greys, Astro projection, everything being connected as one, intuition, physical mindedness and spiritual mindedness.

Given that the Navy and the Pentagon has already admitted the existence of these vehicles in the Nimitz incident it seems fairly clear to me that these vehicles are not made or piloted by aliens. It is now obvious that they have been using this technology in military black ops, probably for decades. If you haven’t heard of the Nimitz incident then just look it up. Search for “tic tac UFOs” or esrch Commander Fravor’s interview on Rogan. There is no conjecture here, these things are real.

It is going very fast and I have no idea how big this thing is to be seen from space though I would estimate at least as big as a plane if not larger to be see from that altitude. The object still seems to be in Earth's atmosphere or perhaps in an area called ""Near Space"" which is where the ISS is situated. Is it traveling across Earth or coming from Space to Earth or leaving Earth and going to Space? What do you think? This seems very alien like to me but I could be wrong. Could be SpaceX, NASA or what have you. Who knows.

aliens,"It took humans about 200,000 years to evolve from primitive beings, to possessing nano-technology. I look around, and though we have accomplished many marvels, it still feels like we are primitive in a lot of ways.

Combustion automobiles, planes, even the computers we use. Sure, these things seem fancy and cool to us because it's peak technology.  Then, you start to rationally fantasize about a civilization that would likely have hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions of years of development on us, and the alien/UFO phenomenon starts to... Make less sense.

We have to assume that any living, intelligent beings would come from outside our solar system, otherwise it's likely we would've made definitive contact by now. With this assumption in mind, they should be so advanced compared to to us, that their appearance, and any technology they wield should be unimaginable.

Yet, 90% of witness encounters say they are bipedal humanoids. And UFOs are always something we recognize; A disk, a cigar shape, an orb, a triangle etc. And they always have ""lights"", which seems like something only a primitive species would need for identification/visibility purposes. 

## Ok, let me get to the point.

There are only 3 possibilities that would allow for these accounts all being so familiar/observable. 

1. Human beings are the creation of extraterrestrials. 

Accomplished through some kind of hybrid breeding program. Perhaps they even created ALL species on earth, as an experiment, or for some other purpose we are ignorant of. 

This theory would explain why we resemble them. Because we **are** them, in a distant genetic sense. It would also explain the variation of species on this planet, and how some of them seem very alien compared to others (Cephalopods, insects, microscopic creatures). What if we find out that life elsewhere in the universe is much more uniform? What if our planet is a little ""zoo"" or petri dish if you will. Aliens on another planet may only have one species that populates the entire planet, or just a few. Just things to think about. 




2. Aliens **ARE** us. 

This theory is a bit more radical, and involves time travel being a possibility. If at some point in our far flung future we harness that ability, and perfect it, what's to say we wouldn't come back to ""primitive"" times, to observe, or maybe even lend a hand? What people could be seeing in these encounters are future versions of human beings, and technology. 

If we continue to evolve, we will likely still at least be humanoid. Grey's, and other species of reported ET's definitely seem more human than alien. 

3. It's all fake, misinterpreted, or just advanced human technology. Aliens haven't been here, and no one has encountered them. 

This theory is most likely imo. I am of the belief that aliens wouldn't resemble anything that we could, or would recognize. They may have even evolved beyond physical forms. I don't think advanced civilizations would be flying around in metal discs, with lights on them. Their technology would, and should be unfathomable. They could probably teleport instantaneously, or maybe something even cooler than that. Whatever it is, ""flight"" seems like it would be a primitive travel method for an advanced civilization. 

These are all obviously just my opinions.","Aliens likely have NOT made contact with us in any way, here's why."

aliens,"I work as a security guard at a large retirement home. 9 PM to 8 AM, Friday night to Tuesday morning. People die here; I've had to personally deal with two death cases. Fun times. Other than the nurses on the other side of the building I rarely see, I am completely alone here... I hope. I've been working here a long time; and the number one issue I have here are the few but terrifying occurances of what I HOPE is all in my head. Hopefully I can just blame the coffee and social isolation. 

There has been a handful of occurances in which I'm walking through the halls and have been suddenly struck by VERY vivid visions of what I can loosely describe as aliens from independance day. Same triangular-shaped head; But they're bipedal and jet black. 

Whenever this happens, I feel a very deep sense of fear and panic, and it's very close to being incapacitating. The first time this happened, it was as if I was envisioning this being, whatever it is, through night vision goggles, looking at me like I caught it in the act. And then the immense fear and panic set in; I nearly collapsed to the floor, suddenly exhausted and wanting to curl up and cry. It was horrible.

There has been two occurances where, very briefly, I DO see them. And it's not a faint glimpse in the corner of my eye; But ten feet away from me. Or closer. Full body, full detail, everything. But only for a brief moment. The first ""full"" sighting was during a patrol a couple months ago; It was crouching in front of me, looking at me for a moment, then disappearing. The second sighting was tonight (and honestly, the straw that broke the camel's back) on my way to the restroom; I ""caught"" it hastily running into the kitchen area. I spent the next 20 minutes in the restroom trying to get a fucking grip on myself. 

The most bothersome aspect of all of this is that I feel these interdimensional beings are here to collect something from the residents that are on the verge of death, or soon after. Whatever they're doing here, they don't like it when I ""see"" them, and will try to ward me off before I find out. 

Have any of you seriously had similar enounters with similar beings like these? They aren't greys, nor reptilians, nor those fancy looking heavenly nordic folk. Quite frankly I'm hoping this is just a product of my social isolation working here. What do you all think?",[SERIOUS] Is it all in my head?

I recently read a thread discussing what people thought to be signs of someone or something either retrieving an implant or scooping out flesh for DNA analysis.


My back story is unimportant and whether or not I believe in aliens is also irrelevant. I just wanted to share something that I was completely confused about until I read that thread. 


Out of nowhere, a lump appeared on the left of my face. It was hard and had no pain or sensitivity. I thought it could be a cyst or some sort of benign tumor. Before going to the doctor, I used a small needle to pierce it, hoping that if it was some sort of infected pore, I could drain it. 


Using a very small needle, I lanced it. Immediately I noticed absolutely no pain was involved. But what I also noticed, was that it crunched. I immediately stopped working, though still curious as to what it was.


The next morning, I found this. No longer was there a lump. Just flat skin with a hole in it. I honestly feel as though something was removed.

aliens,"If you think about it, aliens are these highly intelligent creatures that I believe have lived on this earth well before we have. UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are believed to be propelled by gravitational pole that could move faster than the speed of light. These creatures are assumed to be so highly advanced they would be like humans today to us living in the Stone Age which means a lot coming from the fact that we are the smartest beings amongst all the animals on Earth as we know it.

My point is, when you think of creatures who have been hiding amongst the human civilization for countless centuries, who have an arsenal of high tech equipment we have never been introduced to and wouldn’t know even how to reverse engineer, we gotta think that maybe we have already come into contact them. 

Let’s scratch the whole Bermuda Triangle, Dragon Triangle thing, or air pressure leveled bases under water deep within the oceans to which humans can’t reach or even adapt to without exploding internally.

Maybe we have already come into contact with an alien without even knowing it? If you think of all the weird people walking the streets today or even the amount of people on Earth and those who’ve claimed to have been abducted, do you really think they just study us and that’s it? Well when an actor plays a role, before jumping into that role
They study it, how they would act, what they would eat or how they would think, what’s their routine like? Aliens not only study us but they definitely have the technology to even BE US. If they can fly faster than the speed of light, and have been hiding essentially for all this time, believe me they have implemented ways to disguise themselves as humans, and maybe not all that good either.

You might have already come across an alien and haven’t realized it yet. You might have already talked to an alien and haven’t realized it yet, because they might have blend so well in with humans, because if they have proved humans and studied humans, maybe they have even tuned into our TV stations from even afar like FBI/CIA can do with phone lines?

The link above is to an article i stumbled across on one possible connection between alien abduction claims &amp; DMT.

First off, I’d like to point out that i AM a strong believer in UFO’s and alien abductions. I believe that alien abductions have happened in the past &amp; that they still do occur. 

*However*, after reading this article and doing some research on DMT in the past, i’ve discovered that there are incredibly fascinating (or should i say disturbing!) similarites between the experiences of an alien abductee and experiences resulting from heavy doses of DMT. The most profound being that nearly every single experienced user of hallucinogens describes having a spiritual “guide” on their trip. This pertains only to DMT, not *any* hallucinogen. Studies have found that these “guides” vary from Jesus to actual alien entities &amp; does not always directly correlate with the religious views of the DMT-user. This is what really caught my attention! 

Now, for those that don’t know, DMT is a natural molecule that the human brain releases upon death. Many scientists believe that this is what causes people to have extremely vivid “visions” in near-death experiences, but it is nearly impossible to prove this. 

For the record, I AM NOT SAYING ABDUCTEES ARE ALL JUST TRIPPING BALLS! Like i said before, i believe alien abduction is a real phenomenon. By posting this, I am simply posing the hypothesis that *perhaps* there is a connection between DMT (dubbed “The Spirit Molecule”) and the extreme rise in reported cases of alien abduction, specifically during periods when aliens &amp; ufo’s became popular culture &amp; also (bare with me, please) when MK-ultra was in full swing. 

So, i have a theory. One statement included in the article is by a scientist who strongly believes that it is very possible for DMT to be released in the brain without death. Imagine laying in bed one night, and all of the sudden you’re tripping from one of the strongest hallucinogens in existance, except *you have no idea you’re hallucinating*, and you have this strange entity that knows everything about you and wants to *guide* you. Or, this instantly turns into a bad trip (if you’ve had one of these, you know they can literally shake you to your core) and suddenly this entity wants to harm you. Of course you’ll feel the pain, because you’re hallucinating and you have absolutely no idea. 

Before anyone tries to say I’m just trying to debunk the alien abduction phenomenon, I am *not*. I have no plausible answer for cases in which there is more than one abductee, unless you acknowledge how the US government performed experiments on often-unwilling people during MK-Ultra that included MASSIVE doses of LSD.

LSD does not always give the sense of having a “spiritual guide”, and with the amounts that the gov. was using, you would more than likely eventually realize you were on some kind of drug. Also, I’m not aware of the government using experiments involving DMT, although it would not surprise me if they attempted it. 

So, that’s about all i have to say for now. I could ramble on about this for hours but i’ll stop here. I find this extremely interesting &amp; believe there is certainly some form of connection in SOME cases of abduction!

Everyone who were good souls are already in heaven we put them into which is a higher dimension a spiritual heaven itself and some of them even wanted to come on board our fleet and help us fight other evil aliens races and two years ago I wrote about coronavirus and locusts in a metaphorical sense and accurately predicted it on the day that America started shutting down state by state March 19th, 2020 and so many experiences you wouldn't even believe and yes Im such a troll because im a trol because why would i be a troll if not a troll yes eveyrhting i say i make up and its not real but the real genius is this that most of you who need these words if im a troll or im crazy so you can feed the subconscious fear you have of me and the wortd san the truth imagine if you will if the truth did come and a grey came in ahuman vessel like i did at age 8 when i had two of themost memorable dreams that iknow now were not dream one of which i was in a throne room in a strange room and all my thoguths and imagination coudl be sen on screens literally and i spend the next day days at first baptist christian school elementary school in mishawak indiana thinking the other kids could read my mind but i learned that they could not after some days of absoltuely fear nd terror much liek the horror i felt when my gandpa pastor of 30 years told me i needed to be saved or i will brn in hell and i did it only out of fear then i chased my friend michael kanouse on a bike and told him he needed to be saved or he will got o hell iw as so scared for him because he was my best frined at the time and the other dream was traveling through rings of green rings of memeoriesan di was begging god so i could live again but that was just the previous version of the soul that was in this vessel when the transfer was copelte teh real joshua lee rogearrs went to heaven and i took his place chosin in this aboslute vessel both sides of bipoalr from both side sof my family to exploit the mania side also had loving parents strong christian background all perfected and chosen vessel for me who am i i am jusus christ also around this time at age 8 i saw a grey outside my window outside looking at the bathroom next to myy room but was strange because it had wooden clsoed hsutters on the outside of it and the way it moved was alien and not like anything i ever saw before i am 33 now my awakening now daivd kores was the esvevne seal of the bible and when you al lmrudereed him and his children you brought judgement and he was 33 and i am 33 now on my 33td birthday was the live update first update of neuralink july 16t, 2019 which 2 weeks after i published the book of ppropehect jly 4th 2019 about neuralink i propehjcted that update it wasnt even anoucne the update at jluy 10th, 2019 i am the most intelligent entitie in your world becaus ei am not human you coudl brign your most inteligent humans and they could not defeat me in a game of wits and inteligence and scientific readon and logic my research that is 24/7 racing thoughs and imagination sinc ei was 8 years defies all logic and sense of you understanding of science itself philososphy itsel flif eitself all things because i am a difeetn species than you i am beyodn youtr systems beyodn your grammar yur language you rerverything and no more patience now tme run out time out now and yu will all suffer if yu dont listen to us if you dont listen to me worship me i am your god i am your higher power you humans will worship me in this life or in your afterlife make your choice.

aliens,"yesterday i tripped on shrooms, it is not out of the norm for me to interact with the 'shroom spirit' who i can well distinguish from my own thoughts/ loops. however, while listening to the mushroom another being intersected and came into contact. they were very clearly light beings, i am not sure of what origin. they showed me the light grid around earth, and talked about how earth is an incubator for consciousness. that it was very important to keep humanity safe and how majority of humanity is still 'asleep' because as a species we are not quite ready to fully actualize. they told me that a lot of the discourse and suffering going on right now regarding roots (race, ethnicity, community, etc.) was an important step towards self-actualization in the 3d as we must have a clear understanding of self and roots to fully evolve in a stable manner. they showed me that like a garden, some will and have begun to awaken and self actualize sooner than others. majority of those who have are here to keep consciousness on earth safe so it can fulfill it's destiny of self-actualization (acting like stabilizers? it's a little unclear now trying to recount). 

 (i want to quickly clarify: i did not 'see' a physical form at all, i felt a presence of community- i'm not sure they were really 'speaking' but ofc my 3d brain translated it as such. i feel that there was other information transferred but currently because of mental capacity this is what i can recall at present.) these beings were not necessarily 'warm', but it was clear they meant no harm and wanted us to succeed. it seemed like they were guardians of a kind but more in the sense that a scientist would look after their experiment (however, they clearly respected humans and were invested. i would say their kindness however was not that of a parent to child or friend to friend.) 

&amp;#x200B;

i also want to state: 

i know i was using a hallucinogenic drug at the time of contact, however i have personally never had this sort of interaction while tripping on shrooms (which i have done several times). 

prior to tripping i had been (for some reason) researching string theory, and looking into what multi-dimensionality would be like. 

i also for the past bit have been regularly meditating daily, doing yogic practices, and practicing other rituals of spirituality. prior to tripping (immediately after ingestion) i had followed a guided meditation ('loving awareness' by my favorite teacher ram dass). (i say this because at present moment i do not feel my ego is particularly strong, that's not to say i am without one, i just have an easier time dropping out of ego currently). 

i have had other contacts with other 'spirits' (both under the influence of psychedelics and not), but have never had contact with a light being of this nature. 

i do not at all fault anyone who doubts this experience, as i myself am in slight disbelief that this occurred. they did not take anything from me, they did not 'implant' me, they simply provided information they felt was relevant at this time. 

thank you",light beings contact

When I was a child I had heart problems, my heartbeat was aparently to weak. I even had to be monitored by a machine over night so it could detect if my heartbeat was to weak, and i'm pretty sure it analyzed it all too.

On top of that I got one of these all in one vaccines. I have nothing against vaccines but at that moment it was to much for me. I don't know if it was because I was so little and weak or if it had something to do with my heart problems but because of the all in one vaccine, I got a really bad skin disease. Mi skin would itch and turn read to then slowly go open. This illnes covered my entire body and soon my mother started to bring my to all kinds of doctors. I don't know how many we visited but nobody had a clue about what to do. They gave me creams I think but it didn't work at all. Untill a women saw me with my open skin and told my mother about a group of medics that used a kind of different medicine or methods and that they could help me.

So my mother brought me in the next couple of days to these ""doctors"". I don't remember it at all and even my mother says that her memories about it are very blurred. (I think this all happened 16 years ago so it could be because of the time) The few things that my mother does remember are that the entire building where these doctors worked was very strange, white with weird art pieces on the walls and that there were very few patients too. The only thing my mother remembers about the doctors is that they felt strange to her, like (and I hate to say it) they were not human.

My mother says that they injected something into me and that they gave me medicine (something to drink) for my skin disease. The crazy thing is that in the next days not only my skin illnes vanished but my heart problems too. The disease that many doctors couldn't cure just disappeard.

The only evidence I have are my mothers memories, and this was a long time ago so I don't know how true it is. But I do know that my mother wouldn't lie about something like this and that to this day she claims that aliens cured me.

aliens,"Hello

I have had several dreams of UFOs throughout my life and im wondering if they mean anything...

I once had a dream I was walking on a concrete wall at a beach by some ocean when all the sudden 2 UFOs came from the left and flying maybe 50 to 100 feet above the ocean the UFOs was round but not like a perfect circle and it had lights in the center of it that went completely around it the lights didnt flash but seemed to go around it I watched till it was no longer visible then I woke up...

Another dream I had there was 2 UFOs they came from my left these was saucer shaped very thin a huge... I was around some big hills or mountains there was trees all over them and lots of people around and everyone seen them in the sky and 1 was about to crash and I somehow knew that there was a lake or some large body of water on the other side of the mountain and I knew as soon as it crashed into the water that that water was going to come over the top and was going to be like a flash flood so I try to get everyone around me to run to this tall building to be safe but everyone was like in shock or froze just staring at itso I get as many people safe as I could in the building and remember as going up the stairs I could see the water coming over the mountain headed our way then I woke up...

Then another dream I was on a farm and some freak storm or something happened the sky started to turn black I was with some people when out of nowhere came 2 UFOs from my left these ones I called shuttle buses... There was a guy there and told me I had to protect some girl and he was going to go find someone he took off on a horse and I stayed there waiting the sky looked like a strange black it wasnt night time either so im watching the news and it seemed the UFOs acted as if they was in a hurry picking up as many people as they could the sides had windows and I could see through it and seen people sitting in seats just staring forward but not moving at all then next thing I know I was in there and I swear I seen myself in the UFO but I was much older and had white hair... Then I woke up...

There was a couple of things about those dreams I noticed that seem odd 1 is the they always came in 2s and they always came from my left... Any thoughts as to the meaning of these???",Dreams of UFOs does it mean anything???

aliens,"Stupid post and random shower thought:

I was thinking about this today. Imagine if aliens viewed our modern human culture without the context to understand it.

Say in their abduction missions they also got copies of some movies and the hardware to play them. Would they believe that Jurassic Park was a documentary about the time humanity dabbled in genetics and it went horribly wrong? Would they believe that Terminator or Starship Troopers was a factual reenactment of some long lost war in the past by people who were more advanced; a warning retold for future generations? Would they believe that Aliens is about a real extraterrestrial colony we have somewhere in which we encountered a hostile lifeform they haven't seen, and would they go looking for real Xenomorphs with their technology of interstellar travel?

Likewise, in the far future if/when we find an alien civilization, how will we know the difference between fact and fiction as we sift through their media? They might have films about places or species in the universe or wars involving such things... but how can we tell how much of it is entertainment?

aliens,"Strange theory I heard. What do you think?

I saw an documentary that claimed Gray aliens and Dracos (Reptilians) are not extraterrestrial. It claimed that they’re actually SUBterrestrial. 

Meaning, they have always lived beneath the surface of the Earth. The theory goes on to claim the planet is not molten at its core, but instead it’s a huge crystal that formed due to hydrocarbons being compressed due to gravity. Ie. oil that eventually turned to diamond.

The claim continues to say that there are many, many caverns beneath the surface full of many species that avoid the violent “surface dwellers.”

They have technology that is so advanced that to us it looks like magic. They have ships and they do visit other planets, especially in our own solar system. Apparently there have been civilizations on every planet, but all the resources have been used except on Terra, which we surface dwellers call Earth. 

This theory explains all of our myths about all the creatures from the past that disappeared as well as the ancient alien theory. They hide from us.

It also gives some clues to why there are giant lizard people that like caves and small creatures with huge eyes that would be well suited for the dark.

I mean, we don’t know what’s in the ocean, we know there are underground bases everywhere, and we don’t actually know what’s at the core of the planet, it’s a theory based on magma eruptions which might not go that deep. 

This living planet theory also made me wonder if the core dwellers might be sick of what we’re doing to the planet.... might even be angry enough to wipe most of us out with a bio weapon....like a virus...

Anyways, it tripped me out. There’s a whole book about it.

aliens,"Alright let me start off by saying im pretty sure this is not aliens... But im not sure what the hell it is exactly. My s/o calls me outside to look at the sky and to the east of us there's what appears to maybe lightening in the sky, but its flashing blue, green and red. I recorded it for a few minutes but it was dark and my camera wasn't really picking up a lot of it, especially the blue and green lights. Then I went back inside for a few minutes and I came back out and it had gotten much more intense. Its in the exact same spot, hasn't moved, looks like lightening striking in the exact same spot over and over again, no sounds of thunder ever follows it. I checked the weather report and they are calling for a storm but thats in like 6 hours. I took another video of the more intense lights and caught some of the red flashes really well... filmed for 30 seconds and the lights just stop after going on continuously for 15-20 minutes. Haven't seen anymore flashes since then, and my s/o made a comment that before he called me outside to see the lights he noticed that the clouds looked like they were ""vibrating"". I tried googling some weird lightening phenomenon that might explain this and haven't found anything quite like it.

aliens,"Hey! Im from a very sceptical background.  Resisted religion from the get go, later distancing myself from all spiritual ideas, as an atheist. 

Through interest in ancient civilisations and old religions/well maintained aged cultures, as well as psychedelics, i found that in public eye,  nobody really knows what's going on. What we limit ourselves to in the beliefs others told us about this reality is not discovering truth for ourselves. Given that the mainstream world is wrong about what we should concern ourselves with,  how we should live, details of our history that change with every discovery,  its safe to say listening to others saying the same thing as the rest of the crooked mainstream  world is a misstep, as if they know better than us.. 

But let's be honest.  The new age spiritual world has its fair share of assumptions, misinterpretations, frauds and all sorts of things. But every genre of interest has its downfalls in some of its messengers. 

What the point of interest is the relationship between ancient cultures beliefs,  their ideas on reality and on extra terrestrials, their use of psychedelics and modern use of them, native cultures, hinduism and buddhism, modern encounters,  modern spiritual so called ""channelers"" through telepathy of ETs, what our scientists are currently discovering about the idea of alternate realities, simulation theory, modern popular religions' base ideas( minus ideology ) that may incorporate ET themes and any other areas of interest that can be linked with  these two intriguing reality breaking subjects! 

One thing i want to start off with is that many sources of abductions,  including spirirual info claims there's sometimes very varied ETs on these spacecrafts, so there's supposedly very very wide variation of beings in the cosmos, discussion not limited to the greys.

Happy discussing folks! And of course, stay curious!",Inviting all people and sceptics to discuss the relationship between spirituality and aliens! Stay curious!
aliens,"House Armed Services Committee proposes mandate for elevated UAP office and broad reports to Congress (including ""any efforts underway on the ability to capture or exploit discovered unidentified aerial phenomena"")

The just-released text of FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), H.R. 4350, already approved by the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, contains a 571-word section to impose new obligations on the Department of Defense regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).

These proposed mandates include creation of a new office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to oversee UAP-related investigations on a department-wide basis. I would consider enactment of this language to be a congressionally mandated elevation of the importance of the subject matter of UAP.

The House Armed Services Committee bill also would require annual reports to six key congressional committees that would include updates on, among other things, ""coordination by the United States with allies and partners on efforts to track, understand, and address unidentified aerial phenomena...\[and on\] any efforts underway on the ability to capture or exploit discovered unidentified aerial phenomena... \[and\] assessment of any health-related effects for individuals that have encountered unidentified aerial phenomena.""

The House committee's UAP-related requirements differ from those contained in a proposed Intelligence Authorization Act (S. 2610), approved by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in July, regarding which I and others have previously reported. The two bills are not in direct conflict, but they take somewhat different approaches--the House language has more detailed substantive requirements on some points, but requires less frequent reports to Congress. These two sets of UAP-related requirements should be viewed as proposals-- part of a work-in-progress involving at least four key congressional committees, and other players as well, including officials of the Executive Branch. Defense authorization and Intelligence authorization bills are often (but not always) merged during the legislative process. More likely than not, a single set of UAP-related requirements, applicable to both military and intelligence community components, will be hammered out during the months ahead.

More details, including images of the entire UAP-related section of the bill, at the link.

This aligns with many of the alien theories that get floated about, such as that different alien races ran separate experiments on various nations of earth, or that there are “higher dimensional beings” that would be god-like to us. 

What I like about the article is that it makes it seem like the entity Yahweh is The One, from the Law of One, and that the other ‘gods’ were lesser and not to be worshipped. I feel like everything I’ve read since becoming interested in aliens leads me to believe they (alien races) are all aware of a higher power than themselves and this would make me think this is yet more evidence that humans were taught to distinguish The One from those beings.",A fascinating article about the Elohim that could be interpreted as other-worldly beings.

DFW, Texas

I’m driving West from my friends apartment on my way home. I get to a red light and I’m idling for maybe half a minute. 

Two stationary bright objects catch my gaze above me, close to my rear view mirror.

I’m curious, as they appear much brighter than the neighboring stars, and I start to contemplate that they must be Jupiter and Saturn; deeming that the most likely reason for them to be so vibrant. 

All of the sudden, the higher one becomes incredibly bright, like a spotlight from a helicopter or a road flare if it were in the sky

I’m suddenly stricken with awe and fear, literally like a deer in the headlights.

I verbally attempt to comfort myself by proclaiming “what the fuck???” 

All of the sudden, this “flare” takes off west and up (?) from a stationary position and disappears, like a laser pointer streaked across the sky in a check mark shape and fizzled out.

Didn’t even occur to me to pull my phone out. 

Got home and even had the urge to check my watch, almost expecting to see a bunch of time pass. Freaked me the hell out

I figure it had to be:

1. Meteor, just from a weird angle that made it appear stationary for a bit

2. Fighter jet firing afterburner (trump was in town then, and an Air Force base would have been west of him. Fighter escort?)

3. ________ shit I can’t even say it

aliens,"Hi, for many years I had alien abduction dreams. You know the typical stuff occurred in them sleep paralysis, telepathic communication, floating, and medical procedures. My last dream/ encounter was about 15 years ago. In the last encounter  there was a different type of alien. In my dreams/encounters there have been the child like the ones, the tall lanky ones, the small shadowy ones. But in the last encounter an alien that appeared similar to the child like ones was present. This alien had gold glowing skin. It wasn’t interested in me but my new born daughter. When I objected to him touching the baby, he took away my ability to move or speak until he was gone. So a few months back I had done ancestry.com and was happy to see genes linked to my mother’s side of the family and to my fathers side. Cousins from both sides were linked to me. Recently I submitted to some test to see if I could be a potential bone marrow donor. The doctor asked if my parents were siblings because there was a great deal of homogeneous genes. Well that is flat out impossible because ancestry.com already confirmed my parentage any they are from different gene pools altogether. My mother is Mexican/Native American and my father Scottish/Irish. I wonder if the aliens removed negative recessive genes from my DNA making them  positive homogeneous pairs?",Aliens fixed my DNA

aliens,"I am a baker, and so I wake up around 4 am every morning. I work right across the street in a suburb area so I just walk to work. It's a very peaceful and serene experience, the world is totally quiet and I don't have to wait for any traffic to go by to cross the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, I was walking, per usual. I had an earbud in and was listening to some music, I'm accustomed to seeing planes fly overhead as I live next to a pretty busy airport, so my eyes are usually to the skies anyway as there is something oddly soothing to me about watching airplanes. There are a hundred people in the sky above me all with their own stories and worries and dreams. But, this morning I saw no airplanes. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what I did see was a reddish orange light, quite far away, I'd never seen anything like it. The way the light looked was sort of gaseous in a sense. Like how on a really hot day you can see air on the pavement and it creates a sort of mirror effect, or how you can sort of see air in a really hot oven. Don't really know how else to explain it. It also could have just been shining through a thin cloud as it was a decently cloudy morning. The light itself wasn't gas i'm quite sure, but it looked as if it bent the air around it with that hot effect. I know this was not a plane because the light was incredibly bright, it couldn't be confused with any star or planet or aircraft i've ever seen. After i noticed the light and began to think, ""Wait, this is a UFO!"" It vanished. Actually right as I began to question what the fuck it was, it disappeared. I told nobody about it all day because I didn't want anybody at work to find me loony. I kept walking, I had just noticed it as I reached the parking lot, and I really wanted to see it again. I kept looking but the sky stayed black. Just as I approached the door to my bakery, it appeared briefly again in a completely different area in the sky, before disappearing yet again. Only about a minute had passed since i saw it before, so it was either closer to me than I thought, or it went really fucking fast to get to where it ended up.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share, I figure nobody will believe me if I tell them, but I promise I didn't imagine this. I really wanted to take a video but it felt like I just didn't have time to. It was very dark outside and I didn't think it would reappear. Even then, it only stayed visible for a few seconds before vanishing.

aliens,"I had a super strange experience last night and I'm not sure what to think of it. 

Last night, I woke up around 3am after falling asleep around 11pm. I have some sleep issues and I often wake up in the middle of the night. However, last night when I woke up, I had the sudden urge right away to look out my bedroom window. Out of hundreds and hundreds of days of sleep disturbances, I've never had anything like that. Also, for reference, I live in the Northeast US in a suburb outside a medium-large city.

I look out my window and the sky looks really weird. it was a moderately cloudy night, and I can usually see stars in my neighborhood, but the sky was really bright and full of stars. However, some of these ""stars"" looked super abnormal. At least a few of them were moving really erratically in all different directions. They looked like helicopter lights but they were moving too fast to be anything like that. Maybe 5-7 of them kept disappearing and then coming back with full intensity. I thought that maybe I was just groggy, so I played on my phone a little and came back to my window five minutes later. I still saw the same strange phenomenon. After a few minutes of just staring out my window in curiousity, I heard a loud bang and some sort of debris fell into my front yard. I still haven't investigated it because I woke up late this morning due to lack of sleep and was too focused on getting ready for work. Also, I'm going away with a friend until Sunday and they're picking me up from work. However, I definitely plan to investigate when I get home.

aliens,,"mysterious lights over the ocean, ¿UFOs?"
aliens,"   The fact that almost every ufo video/picture you can find turns out to be underwhelming is confounding.

I look it like the Fermi Paradox applied to UFOs instead of distant stars.  Given the vast amount of alleged close encounters, you would expect to find physical proof confirming them, but you don't. Yet, they undoubtedly occur and cant otherwise be explained. 

You would think clear footage would have emerged in the 1950s given the volume of reports.  We have hours of footage from Sept 11, 2001, yet virtually nothing from when an alleged mile long craft slowly flew over Phoenix in 1997.  Most of the recorded footage from that day was later proven to just show flares.  Skeptics will say the 10,000s of witnesses fell victim to mass hysteria, but I don't buy that for a second.  Something extraordinary definitely happened that day, yet somehow no concrete evidence emerged to prove that it did, this doesn't add up.  There is more going here than we are aware of.  10,000s of people who end up seeing something so unprecedented like an alien craft would normally have hours of camcorder footage (In 1997, 480p capable analog camcorders were ubiquitous).  There should be 100s if not 1,000s of clear pictures corroborating what the witnesses saw.

Thousands of people witnessed black triangles flying through the sky in the Belgian UFO wave in 1989.  This included imany credible observers but the only hard evidence gathered was a single lousy low resolution⁰ photograph that could easily have been faked. 

There is a blatantly obvious paradox here that needs to be discussed.  The amount of physical evidence is severely disproportional to the quantity of these close encounters.

If anyone manages to get up close, clear 4k footage of a real ufo - there seems to be invisible forces at work that have the capability to prevent physical evidence from being publicly known.  Stuff only leaks if the powers that be decide to allow it to leak, imo thats a better explanation than anything else.  We don't know what's impossible vs possible when dealing apparent technology 10,000s years more advanced than our own.",Fermi Paradox applied to UFOs/encounters?

aliens,"Hi all,

I am in the middle of reading Dr. John Mack's book (""Abduction"") about his extensive research with individuals who have experienced alien abductions. What I found interesting is that all of the cases that I've read so far involve people who have been abducted in the middle of the night, usually accompanied by sleep paralysis. I have never been abducted myself, but I experience sleep paralysis rather frequently, which is usually followed by an out-of-body experience where I am able to ""float"" around my bedroom and house; float through the ceiling, windows, and walls; sometimes see other ""beings"" in my room (not aliens, but rather ""spirits"" or ""beings"" who are dark and somewhat transparent).

 Initially, during sleep paralysis I used to experience a menacing presence, such as a dark figure in my room (the ""hat man""), or an evil being sitting on my chest trying to suffocate me. However, after some time these negative experiences associated with sleep paralysis stopped. Now, whenever I get sleep paralysis I just ""leave"" my body and ""explore"" this other strange realm. 

Through my personal encounters with sleep paralysis and out-of-body experiences (""astral projection""), I am convinced that this ""other world"" I experience when I leave my body is another reality (perhaps another dimension?). In many ways, it ""feels"" and ""looks"" like the ""real world"", but at the same time it is slightly ""off"" and ""different"".

Now, considering the similarities between sleep paralysis and alien abduction, I'm wondering if alien abductions occur in this ""other dimension"" as well? I know that some people who have experienced humanoid encounters recalled that the ""beings"" used some sort of ""tool"" to paralyze them so that they could not move, but their consciousness remained intact and they were aware of what was going on. I guess I am just thinking aloud, and trying to organize my thoughts around this, but I really feel that abductions and perhaps all UFO phenomenon come from a different dimension. However, the phenomenon is able to ""manifest"" itself physically in this dimension as well, which would explain our ability to sometimes detect UFOs on radar, or capture photographs and videos of it. ( I am familiar with Jacques Vallee's interdimensional hypothesis, which has influenced a lot of my own views stated here).

Anyway, thanks for reading. I would be curious to know your thoughts. And, if anyone has experienced abductions AND sleep paralysis on separate occasions. I'd be curious to know what your experience was like, and what you think the connection is between these two phenomena.",Connection between sleep paralysis and alien abductions?

&amp;#x200B;

I recently finished ""Space Age Indians: Their Encounters with the Blue Men, Reptilians, and Other Star People"" by Ardy Sixkiller Clarke.

Regarding her professional background her website states the following:

&amp;#x200B;

""*Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke brings to the field of ufology degrees in history, English, psychology, and educational leadership and a background as a teacher, university professor, junior college and university administrator, licensed therapist and psychologist, and social science researcher. As a Professor Emeritus at Montana State University and  former Director of the Center for Bilingual/Multicultural Education, Dr. Clarke, who is Cherokee/Choctaw, has worked with indigenous people for most of her career. Her first book in the field of ufology  was the best-seller Encounters With Star People: Untold Stories of American Indians.*""

[http://www.sixkiller.com/#section-1](http://www.sixkiller.com/#section-1)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this doesn't rule out that either she is making up the stories or her interviewees but the fact that she has interdisciplinary university background lends some credence to her work. 

&amp;#x200B;

In this second part interview with Richard Dolan, Barbara Lamb, a ""*a licensed psychotherapist, hypnotherapist and regression therapist in Southern California*"" (for biographical information see [https://ufocongress.com/barbara-lamb/](https://ufocongress.com/barbara-lamb/)) tells about her own encounter with a Reptilian:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESq\_YkExmME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESq_YkExmME)

&amp;#x200B;

I think that her professional background also lends some credence to her work, but again, this doesn't rule out fraud or a fertile imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

In ""Walking Among Us. The Alien Plan to Control Humanity"" Dr. David M. Jacobs, ""*a recently retired Associate Professor of History at Temple University*"" (for biographical information see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_M.\_Jacobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Jacobs)) several times mentions the Reptilians (on page 22, 29 and 261) that were seemingly encountered by people who were able to remember these encounters by undergoing regression.

&amp;#x200B;

aliens,"(21 y/o F) Curious if anyone on here has experienced anything similar.. I don't use reddit much, but figured this would be the best place for me to bring these kind of vague questions.  

To get right into it, for as long as I can remember I've been pretty ""in tune"" with things.. I wasn't raised spiritual at all, though as a kid I always had adults calling me an ""empath"" and I had many extremely vivid recurring dreams that would actually unfold in real life years down the line.  I've never sought out a psychic reading intentionally, but somehow every once in a while (every couple years, maybe more often) I'll meet a person who tells me some creepily spot-on, deeply psychic kind of shit.  Maybe I'm fucking schizo, but I'm pretty positive that I'm not and that I've had actual conversations with certain individuals -telepathically-.  The first time it happened to me, I was sitting beside my friend after a long day and his voice came through in my mind as clear as day - it scared the shit out of me, I ended up crying and coming up with an excuse to leave on the spot because I was that freaked out.  He eventually told me something super cryptic about aliens and how \[I'm\] ""not from here"".. I wrote it off at the time and stopped hanging out with him cause it was just weird to me but since then I've had even more similar experiences with multiple others.. sometimes it's happened with close friend's but just as often it will happen with complete strangers.  People I don't even have a real opinion about.  I happen to be an exotic dancer as well, so I'm constantly meeting random people and nut jobs.  Nothing surprises me much anymore.. I've learned to read people extremely well.  Yet it still does a bit when I get this kind of thing because it doesn't happen at work, I get stopped on the street, randomly.

Back in 2016, I hiked part of the pacific crest trail in Nevada with a group of friends through the high sierras.  On our way into the mountains we saw what we decided at the time had to have been a UFO- we saw it shoot across the sky one more time 2 weeks later on our way out, maybe only 5 miles from where we had seen it last.  I remember us all losing our minds about it, but as the years have gone by, I kind of just wrote it off as probably a satellite or a meteor..  but why would it have been flying so low and slow?

I saw a similar shape in the sky a week later, while we were setting up camp at the base of Mt. Shasta in California.  I was alone that time, and I kind of forgot about that too.  I've never said anything about this to anyone, or even thought about it much till now.  I wonder if there's something to it.  Last week I met a masseuse who happened to be a psychic.  Among other things, she was able to tell me exactly where my bedroom was located in my childhood home, she knew I had been homeless before in my life, and knew I spent some time hiking in the west, and even told me someday in the foreseeable future I would find myself in Arizona and experience a drastic but ultimately positive life change..  eerie stuff",Odd Coincidences

aliens,"Saw something interesting today that I can’t explain. Was driving through Colorado this morning and noticed what looked like a black contrail. The trail seemed to start in the Rocky Mountains and shot vertically from West to East. It wasn’t “cloudy” like most contrail. It looked almost like a solid black line straight up into the universe. Once the contrail hit the clouds I could no longer see where it went, or how high/far it went. Additionally odd, the black trail looked solid as I mentioned but also like a solid shadow. It wasn’t overly dark... almost like an all black rainbow that debit you arch back over and kept going vertical out into space. 

The area of the Rockies I saw this trail is also known for UFO sightings. Perhaps my mind wants to conflate two independent things (known UFO sightings and a simply explained “contrail) but my intuition told me I was seeing something created by something not of this planet.

aliens,"My boyfriend and I were sitting on our patio with a little fire going and I was doing some stargazing. After not too long, I noticed a star that was moving north at a pretty fast speed (I'm assuming from how high up it seemed to be flying).

About 60 seconds later I saw ANOTHER star moving in the same exact manner and seemingly the same exact speed but this time it was moving south. THIS TIME he saw it so I know I'm not crazy. 30 seconds later ANOTHER moving in what looked to be the same exact path as the last one and he saw this one too. 

We are both mind blown at how similar they looked to the stars around them. And let it be known that I have seen a million shooting stars over the course of my life and this was absolutely NOT that. They didn't blink like a plane would and they were SO high up from the looks of it. They blended so seamlessly that I'm sure I've missed them a million times. Anyone else witness this?

I recall people entering my room at night sometimes, when I was a kid. One morning, during breakfast, I asked my father what was he doing in my room at night because he turned on the lights. He looked puzzled and said nobody was in my room. 

Anyway, when I was 16, 17 I got visited by a grey who stared into my eyes really up close. I couldn’t look away from him.

He could “read” everything I was thinking, as I was thinking it - including my subconscious thoughts ( I wasnt even aware of them! But he reflected them back onto me) 

He had this huge fucking hatred towards me and humanity. Like we were pests. He projected images of earth getting destroyed in the future. 

I told him this is not right and its not ethical to hurt me. Instantly he said that I/we farm and eat animals and asked me whats the difference between them utilizing us and humans farming creatures for meat? 

Another thing I remember is that the greys are all part of one consciousness and they comunicate wih each other and can feel each other thoughts instantly. I could hear the other ones.

He had huge black eyes and when I looked into them everything was vibrating and it felt like he’s draining my soul or eating it for lack of better word.

The thiughts he gave me were all extremely angry and hateful... I don’t understand this experienxe at all, 10 years later I barely think/remember it

Also he was waaay fucking smarter than me. My IQ is 138, but I felt outclassed. He could think so fast. He could instantly answer my thoughts in such a refined and concise way full of hatred and intensity. It’s super fucking freaky to look into their eyes and realize the thing looking at you is smarter than you. It is just so unimaginably creepy.

aliens,"Hello, 

Currently our production company is moving forward with a documentary we have previously posted about. This documentary aims to focus on the archetypal nature of the phenomenon popularized by John Keel and Jaqcue Valee. More specifically, we’re not just focusing on a psychological angle, we aim to essentially address the recent AATIP documents that mention the phenomena’s ability to change both cognitive and physical reality. We have interviewed contactees across the planet and discovered many interesting commonalities and stories. Our aim to make it clear you cannot separate the recent main stream UFO developments and the more unnerving aspects of the phenomenon. 

Moving forward we are attempting to have an in person meetup with abductees in the Southern California area, we will likely keep our final group around 8 as we will make sure we can social distance and follow Covid guidelines when shooting. If this applies to yourself or someone who may be interested please reach out, I’d love to learn your story, tell you more about the project, and see if we can work around our schedules to get some truly great contactees. 

As I understand it, the abduction and contact experience is often not taken as seriously as nuts and bolts craft. That being said from my recent research and interviews I can definitely say John Keel may be on the money and this phenomena is still very alive and well, even if our “space brothers” don’t have as much as a mainstream media presence as they once did.

aliens,"POSSIBLE LARGE SCHOOL ABDUCTION.Before I came to Australia I lived in quebec, I went to a pre-school that we used to sleep in.

My only very very clear memories are a few, I used to bring the situations up with my parents, my mother claims she can't remember anything and my dad would always seem agitated and slightly aggressive when I asked about this and would simply say "" it is in the past and it was just a joke the government was doing for you kids to cheer you up"". This was in 2006.

From what I can remember with absolute clarity I can tell you this, one night at the pre school ( we have a teacher or carer with us at all times even when we slept), one night..I remember waking up and all of us was crying, we complained of headaches, migraines, extremely bad dreams and insomnia.. which personally I never fully recovered from since canada ( the insomnia I mean ), most of us pissed ourselves in our sleep, when we woke up it was extremely quite but none of the adults in the building seemed to wake up at the time...I remember it being extremely quite... We lived somewhat next to a road and we heard absolutely no electricity and no cars, no bugs.. just nothing, I cannot remember my memories after that, only after all of our personalities seemed to change some slightly others a lot... I started to steal things ( kleptomania) at a very young age for no reason at all, my friend that was always quite developed frequent nose bleeds and slight behavioural problems, for a few days or weeks most of our parents slept with us because I remember suddenly not feel safe in the Building at night time, so my dad would usually come sleep with me. 

Some of us started to frequently urinate, some of our personalities completely changed and some never changed at all. 

I was told that we moved because everytime I stayed in Quebec my immune system got extremely weak. After 3-4 years of living there suddenly I couldn't live there anymore because I kept getting "" sick"" and I mean usually sore throats but I DO remember this... I do remember getting sick every time we came back to quebec... Anyways about what Felt like two weeks after or so firefighters came and started to come 6 times a day ( approx which after let's say after about half a month turned to about 2 times every few days or so). There were men but mostly women with them in PLAIN CLOTHES NOT IN BLACK like in the movies, they started to come after only staying each time for 15 minutes which turned to hours which eventually after only coming a few times a couple weeks ( roughly) they stayed sometimes half a day, always two firetrucks spotlighting the sky with three colours, light green, violet purple and a normal spotlight.

"" Don't worry nothing is wrong we are looking for Santa "" 

I remember asking "" is Santa really real??""

They told me something like "" we don't know that's why we are here to look in the skies and try to find him"" 

About 3-6 months after this we left the country because like I said I was constantly always sick.... Never had allergies before or anything like that BUT IT WAS EVERY. SINGLE. SEASON. Every couple weeks I seemed to develop ulcers at the top of my mouth, changed diet and everything, took medicine but it simply became too much, I also developed sudden tinnitus, I bleed from my ears.

This is what I can remember from the top of my head, feel free to ask any questions and I will try my hardest to answer with as much detail as I can. 

Does anybody remember scenarios or situations like this or am I completely crazy??? But I am telling you guys SOMETHING happened, I don't know if it's aliens or the government or what but its just too weird to forget about.

Therefore, we should seriously consider the information he has shared with the public. The following is a list of claims by DeLonge. Information that he alleges came from government and military officials.

&amp;#x200B;

* During the Cold War (1947-1991) non-human entities (whether it be UAP or otherwise is never mentioned) were disabling and activating nuclear weapons systems inside the US; and the Russians could detect when these systems were activated. DeLonge's contact said the Russians could have very well reacted by launching their nuclear missiles, but didn't. After these events, the US started developing ways to prevent this from happening in the future.
* The US has instruments that monitor and analyze the electromagnetic spectrum of aerospace and it has picked up UAP.
* There has been more than one UFO crash. Crashes have been going on since at least the 1940s.
* If the general public understood what was going on, then there would be an influx of interest in space exploration and space defense similar to how there was an influx of people joining the US military after the September 11 attacks.
* The US is developing anti-gravity technology.
* Internally, aliens aren't referred to as ""aliens"" or ""the phenomenon;"" instead, they're referred to as The Others. DeLonge's contacts have told him that these beings are like gods and that they're warring with each other.
* Behind the scenes, The Others are manipulating the governments of the world with false religions and other systems with the goal of inciting war. The Others have purposely crashed UFOs in countries with the goal of passing on dangerous technology while simultaneously perpetuating the idea that aliens are flying around in spaceships. DeLonge says that when the US takes an interest in a country like North Korea it may be because that country has obtained dangerous alien technology.
* Ancient stories about gods interacting with human beings and human beings worshipping them are literal.
* The US government is aware of the machinations of The Others but it isn't clear to them how much other governments know hence the secrecy. Who has more alien technology? How much do other governments know? Who is being manipulated? Is anyone allied with The Others?
* The Others are behind cattle mutilations and abductions. DeLonge speculates that these beings feed off evil/negativity.

I'll update this list accordingly if I come across anymore claims by DeLonge.

aliens,"I have this idea that I might jump the gun on that perhaps has a chance to bring about or at least quicken a disclosure scenario. Back in 2019 the area 51 raid was really popular. One of the only reasons why it didn’t succeed (besides raiding a military base being a stupid idea that never would have worked) was because not that many people could participate in it. Ya people could meme about it and say they were going but the “raid”  wasn’t global in any way. So I propose an idea what if instead of doing another area 51 Facebook event we instead do a Contact event. The whole point of the event could be to get the attention of brothers and sisters of the aliens we couldn’t save last 2019. It can be called the Roswell Raid (Contact Day)! We can make multiple Facebook event posts about “Raiding” Roswell where we go to the original sight that Roswell aliens were taken and use thousands of lights to signal to their brothers and sisters. With this event, we can emphasize that from anywhere you can participate you just need at the right date and time to use your brightest and most colorful lights or even lasers to signal into the sky. Another way that this could go viral if we encourage lasers. Ya, I know bad idea BUT at the same was raiding a military base which is one of the reasons it was so hyped up. Plus we can use the past event to hopefully help get this one popular. What we would need also is to do multiple postings on Facebook of this event and other websites preferably for the same date and time.  Maybe if something like this becomes popular the government will see this as more of a problem cuz the lasers than the area 51 raid and then perhaps they would be even more likely to disclose before the event.

Was thinking it could be on the anniversary of the crash but maybe that would be too far off. We prob wouldn't want to do it in winter tho too cuz it would be too cold and a little too close to now. 

Would love thoughts on how it could be improved and when the event should be and also confirmations that other people are interested in posting this event and helping to promote something like this. Maybe if there are enough people interested we can get together online and coordinate posting and promoting an identical or very similar event.

Given  their case is true, and from the amount of lie detector tests all these  guys undertook, it's already more credible than any other abduction  case, we can draw many interesting conclusions from what happened to  Travis while being inside alien space ship. First of all, this looks  like one big fuck up on the aliens behalf, something unprecedented  before(not counting Colares and couple other exceptions where aliens  'lost it').

Hovering in dark  forest ufo got 'surprised' by these guys passing through? Whats more  interesting, they approached it quite fast, so the craft didn't have  time to lift of as they usually do, maybe it was doing some maintenance,  maybe these 3 greys simply messed something up(I bet their overlords  got their heads for this 'pr nightmare'). In any case, craft started to  behave violently and kinda unnatural for ufo usually being silent and  calm in its functioning. So this accident happened, that some jolt of  energy hit Travis ,who was too close of malfunctioning craft? Perhaps  this is the reason why they felt, they need to amend to him for the  injuries and damage, that happened due to their fault?

In  brief Travis story inside the craft, it doesn't even look like typical  alien probing, more like they are healing him from the excessive trauma  he endured, whats more they seem to be shocked after his awaking not  much less than Travis. They run off for 'backup' cause situation is  beyond fubar now? So here is the thing - the actual aliens are coming as  a last resort - human looking like nordics like from all the tales back  in the day. He wear space suit, so Travis would get this familiar  feeling of seeing human astronaut or simply he wear that to hide the  differences they have compared to humans. Either way it makes sense and  served its purpose well to get him out of the craft so they can drug  him, finish the healing process and return him.

This  is for me the case, if real, that basically compromises what is the  real alien agenda here or at least the structures of it and who is  really in charge here. That real aliens are much human looking like,  maybe even they are some proto humans, maybe we are made for their  image, the ufos in the skies are simply drones operated by 3 little grey  bio engineered drones strictly for that purpose - their very weird  physics now makes a lot more sense, maybe they are part of the  'propulsion' systems being able to operate these crafts with telepathy  and for instance the real alien humans can't. Maybe they aren't even  really aliens but are living here on earth for a very long time, hidden  in the oceans or someplace else, hence they are so concerned about what  we are doing with nuclear arsenal whole the time cause they are sharing  this planet with us? Now the 'alien agenda' makes a lot more sense,  doesn't it?",Travis Walton 'abduction' case is a compromise of secret alien agenda here on earth

I really have no proof of the below claims and I am posting this on my main account and for the sole reason that some of the claims will be proven, or at least theoretically in a few years, under a decade if i had to guess.   
This being said, I am in no way a scientist and will try to explain what was told to me in the same way that I understood it.  
Basically outside of our universe theres a big neuronal network composed of a big number of links and by big I mean that it could very well be a bigger number than we can comprehend.   
These links connect in neuron like bubbles of energy. Sometimes and in certain bubbles a lot of links meet in the same small spot and a lot of energy is released, this is what created the big bang and our universe and this is what our scientists will prove in the following years.  
There's more to it, some stuff that I will not claim here or now but basically the neuronal links create similar big bangs almost all the time due to its immensity and thus creating different universes.  
This is mainly the reason as to why we have an almost infinite number of dimensions and why life evolves to have neuronal networks in a form or another, mimicking the one that created it.

aliens,"So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/oxgpnm/the_us_airforce_is_trying_to_shut_this_topic_down/) earlier today.  I had a feeling something like this was happening and its concerning.  Ross Coulthart is a respected journalist, so I take his word for it on this.  Not just because he is a respected journalist, but because this makes a lot of sense.

Basically he is saying that there is an active attempt from the US airforce to have the investigation into UFOs shut down.  He goes on to say this multiple times as well as mentioning that their attempts to silence this topic is the reason why we haven't been seeing any leaks lately.  Furthermore he goes on to say that he thinks the only way we ever get disclosure or at the very least Congressional hearings about this is for the American public to demand it.

The last sentence of that paragraph is why I am concerned.  I genuinely think that not enough people care enough to even look into this topic at all.  Take the peak of the UFO ""hype"" for example.  We had a 60 Minutes segment, multiple leaks (however interesting or disappointing they were), and the community started growing.  The problem is that it was really only popular amongst people like us or over in r/UFOs.  

While the hype was at its peak, I was really interested in seeing how people would react.  Unfortunately, it wasn't how I was hoping it would be.  There were people like us, who are interested in this stuff, talking about it.  On the flipside there were MANY people dismissing it, calling it ridiculous, and coming up with really stupid debunks that were completely out of the realm of possibility but people believed it anyway.  I'm not talking about the skeptics who had done their research or have at least come up with reasonable explanations, but people outright dismissing it with certainty and a significant amount of people buying into it.

As I see it, there are only two ways that we ever figure this thing out.  The first is that a civilian captures something that is concrete proof.  Whether they are actually alien craft, or some very advanced drone, natural phenomena, etc..  The second is that people like us, who genuinely have a desire to know about what is going on, push much harder.  

Its obvious that doing what we are doing right now is not working.  The military and the government are extremely powerful and could shut this whole thing down whenever they want to.  I feel as though if we continue how we are, we should prepare for decades and decades of more silence, secrecy, and dismissal.  Also whether you see guys like Elizondo, Corbell, Mellon, etc. as good or bad, we need to back them.  You're beliefs on them aside, they are getting the word about UFOs out into the public.  We need more people like them to help get the curiosity and desire to know about them to people who don't even think about this kind of stuff.  

Individually I have no idea how to help push.  We need to find a way to get people out there to start taking this seriously and not just look at the whole topic as a funny/cute hobby or interest.  Look, whether they are actually aliens or not, I want to know what's going on.  We all talk about how we want to find out the truth in our lifetimes.  In order to achieve that we have to find a way to get this stuff talked about in a serious manner more.  Especially among the general public.  Between r/UFOs and r/aliens we have almost 1 million people.  With those kinds of numbers I feel like we can find some kind of answer.",We need to push harder to achieve any kind of disclosure

Seeing all the ongoing ecological destruction and the 'too little, too late' response of government and business leaders to climate change, I've come to realize that maybe it is a scenario I hope for.    Humanity in its current form clearly is not capable of being the Earth's steward, and without  intervention from a more advanced power of some sort we, and many plant and animal species with us, will be doomed.

aliens,"Topic is about the new, densely informative series, which paints a very detailed history of in most part, USA’s knowledge and citizen experience of UFOs and ET’s, as well as Russia/USSR and China’s. Other countries experiences are included as the episodes go on, making an increasingly more powerful statement as you continue. IMO: The series is well done, although the animation is cringeworthy at best. 

As the episodes continue, they are much more fascinating in scope and begin to include locations from all around the world. Most notably and most powerful, at least for me; this is including the longtime beliefs of the existence of ET’s historically. They are referred to as Star People (along with other names), from countless different groups, mainly tribes residing in South America, and Native Americans. 

Full disclosure, my thoughts on extraterrestrial life comes as follows and has been this way from a young age: it seems extremely egotistical to think we are alone in this universe. The existence of life outside of humanity has always been a no brainer to me. 

This series was fascinating to me because it put a lot of pieces together I wasn’t able to before. Of course nuclear plants would be a hot spot. A warning, or even a form of protection, as an attempt to say not to destroy ourselves. 

In addition, witness testimony from someone who worked in the most secretive laboratory for 27 years, and was asked to do samples and dissections on ET remains, said that 100% of all contained human DNA.

Usually it seems the visiting beings just watch from a distance or communicate telepathically but without really making any kind of greeting gesture, or at least there's often no mention of suchs or the details of the greeting. Maybe physical greetings are to some degree rather redundant when we are crossing the boundaries of culture and species etc?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a bit off to the side of the topic, but the common 'hand shake' is something I've personally found rather artificial and even crude tbh. Don't take offence if you really like it, but sometimes it can be used as a way of testing physical strength or masculine character, so to me it doesn't always come off as a genuine neutral greeting.

The namaste on the other hand feels more natural to me, if we had to use some kind of a greeting gesture at all. It has even appeared in different cultures.

To put it short and simple even though realistically it was so much more elaborate to experience, I was asleep beside my partner, normal routine after a long day, time for bed. 
I remember waking up at an early hour of the morning (the exact hour is not clear) and experiencing sleep paralysis which wasn’t unusual for me. 
I remember laying flat on my back and my side of the bed being directly across the bedroom door roughly 4 metres from me, I couldn’t move but I was very fully aware as it seemed I was actually awake but I’m not sure I was. 
All I remember is seeing a small grey being with huge oval shaped eyes, as black as black could be, standing in my doorway looking at me. 
Beside him on his right was a tall albino man, dressed in a very pristine black suit, white shirt and black tie, also looking at me. 
2 more albino men, identical to the man next to the grey, features, clothes and all, slowly followed behind this being and they all just stood there standing at me. 

It really shook me up. 
I woke up suddenly in a panic, stared at my door but of course nothing was there. 
I felt extreme anxiety and even woke my partner to tell her.

Pretty interesting article on UFOs that ran in the Toledo Blade (regional paper in Ohio) that includes an interview with Commander David Fravor (a Toledo native). The most interesting part of the article, though, was probably this: 

At night, Jan Maccabee likes to sit on the backyard deck of her house in Lima with her camera. When you live on a ""secondary version of Skinwalker Ranch,” near a woods haunted by Predator-like and six-armed creatures, you should always be on standby.

One summer night last year, a bright light suddenly shone down from 1500 feet overhead, its source a dark triangular shape hovering above a nearby tree. A small luminescent entity floated down, its wings glowing green with a tinge of blue. Mrs. Maccabee’s eyes popped — the entity was only visible on her phone camera.

She watched, transfixed, as the fairy-alien hesitated at the edge of the patio’s stairs before, after some coaxing, scuttling onto and up her leg. The “fuzzy,” ticklish sensation, like “insect legs,” gave way to a “rush of loving peace” that she’d never felt before in her life. The fairy-alien then fluttered back to the tree, where it ""blew up"" to a height of 14 feet with a 12-foot wingspan. Then just as quickly the “magnificent” figure shrunk to a red dot, “zipped up” into the light and vanished.

Mr. Maccabee can’t explain what he and his wife saw. He’s always favored the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs, because at least the idea of interstellar travel has a vague scientific plausibility — but he can’t say there wasn’t a fairy on the porch.

The line distinguishing UFOs from the paranormal, Mr. Wertman noted, has always been a foggy one: “If you saw mysterious glowing orbs inside a house, you'd think they're from the spirit world. But if you saw them outside, you'd think they're UFOs.”

Brian Graupner, who moved in with the Maccabees last month, doesn’t know what “they” are — extraterrestrial, interdimensional or even extratemporal — but he’s personally known them for decades, ever since three of the thousands visited his bedroom. He’s seen their crafts so regularly that he’s named them, and is from those chosen to receive their telepathic messages. The most important one: “Evil has to go before they can come down.” They’re guardians, guiding us, and they’re “not going to let us destroy this planet.”",Tic-tac sightings and “fairy” visitations in Ohio (Toledo Blade article)
aliens," 

When we look towards our future the single biggest factor in our long term success and survival as a species will depend be how much smarter we become.

[https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-cybernetics/](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-cybernetics/)

In this article it states that

&gt;improving memory, thinking in many dimensions and communicating by thought alone are other distinct potential — yet realistic — benefits, with the latter of these also having been investigated to an extent. To be clear, all these things appear to be possible (from a technical viewpoint at least) for humans in general.

It is already completely plausible and inside the realm of established science that we can use technology to enhance our mental abilities.

We can perhaps visualize how the future will look 20-50 years from our current technology, but we are reaching a tipping point where the greatest changes of all will take place.

If you haven't already watched "" Good Will Hunting, Limitless, the phenomenon (1996), and powder(1995), do so now!

These movies demonstrate just the tip of the iceberg.

If every person was a smart as Will is in Good will hunting the advances we would make are utterly incomprehensible. We think we know everything, we think we are always right about what we believe in until someone with with a 250+IQ comes along and proves to us that we are utterly clueless and know virtually nothing. In general as individuals we are incomprehensibly stupid and unable to find objective truth vs let's say a person with a 10, 000+ IQ. If you could read through all the information available out there regarding every alleged ET/UFO case both from both a believer and skeptic viewpoint I would value your opinion on that subject over everyone. By far. Like comparing and of out focus 240p black and white photo vs a perfectly clear 24 hour video in 8k. Our perception of reality is precisely fine tuned from evolution via natural selection so help us survive, it is NOT created for the purpose of perceiving reality accurately, and it does a horrible job at that.

To your typical 175+ IQ person today, the overall world understanding and set of beliefs held by your average 100 IQ must seem laughably stupid and riddled with contradictions. You would not consider their opinions an accurate source of information vs a person with a better grip on reality who understands all related facts .

I don't mean to overemphasize the importance IQ alone. That is a very limited measurement of overall mental capability. For the purposes of this thread I'm using IQ as tool to measure comparisons and for everything related to mind capacity; emotional intelligence, street smarts, social skills or other potential areas not usually directly related to IQ. Chris Langan could be a good example of this, though I tend to think his difficulties arise more from a hard upbringing.

Anyways, the idea that we will become super geniuses eventually is imo fact, like the simulation theory it assumes little beyond human non-extinction. Assuming our technology can keep improving in this field even by minor amounts, in 500+ years into our future we all will have:

IQs in the 5,000+ range, perfect eidetic memory, Global instant telepathic communication, limitless knowledge via some internet, speaking in all known human language, problem solving skills to code windows 11 from scratch, degrees from every known PHD topic and ability to count and measure the speed, density and volume simultaneously on every visible raindrop during a thunderstorm. Instead of telling bedtime stories to our 5 year-olds, they will be finding unique solutions to Fermat's last theorem. They will be reciting dictionaries backward in 50+ different languages word for word as easily as we sing the alphabet.

This isn't some crackpot woo woo theory either; it is already hypothetically possible to do all this and absolutely inevitable that science will found out how. Maybe 100 years, maybe 10,000 or even billions of years. We only need to posit non-extinction and continuous scientific progress.

Could you imagine what we will accomplish once everyone is smart enough to see through individual bias and agree on everything. We know for certain that some things are absolute fact because of science and we can make accurate predictions on but so much is also not fully understood, just look at quantum gravity. Making definitive conclusions about the nature of UFOs, government cover-ups and aliens might actually be outside of our mental ability No amount of information can teach us certain things anymore than a chimp can comprehend differential calculus because you've given him a dozen textbooks. If this ET/UFO stuff is indeed real someone smart enough might have the ability to make a pristinely compelling and factual report silencing the skeptics, or vice versa.

The point is I think there's an evolutionary stage in the development of civilizations where individuals become orders of magnitude smarter then before they had tech to enhance mental functioning. This might be what truly defines if a species can be considered intelligent.

Okay so how is this relevant to aliens and/or non-human intelligence?

I'll get straight to the point: perhaps it's already happened. Perhaps there is intelligent life so smart they can purposely dumb down their apparent mental ability to look, act, behave and talk like your average Joe.

Well, considering all things:

UFOs are real, they appear intelligently controlled and are so technologically advanced they defy our understanding of physics. If intelligent civilizations exist outside of Earth they must have already gone through the evolutionary stage of making themselves smarter to be able to get here. How smart? there are absolutely no limits. They could store the entire internet in short term memory and do search requests more accurately than our best supercomputers.

With cybernetics and plausible future information technology a surgical neurological implant connected to our brain synapsis will enable us to do everything a computer can do. Perhaps many orders of magnitude faster than our best supercomputers. ETs would have to be at least this smart I would think Any advanced technological civilization would have gone through a phase the greatly increased their innate intelligence, perhaps gene editing can accomplish this. We're already doing something similar with crisper.

I think if we're trying to understand the agenda's and behaviors of this non-human intelligence interacting with the planet we have try to look at us like they would. If you could imagine a colony of ants hidden 100s of miles from human civilization that's probably what we look like to them. A wild animal living in its natural habitat far away in some galactic wilderness.

I feel like the human race is still stuck in a toddler phase. We probably require baby sitters to keep us in check, or did during nuclear testing. They probably have rules about non-interference, like the prime directive in Star Trek. Earth could be a zoo, prison or entertainment resource like the Truman show. Something about this reality has always felt artificial on some level to me. We are completely oblivious to some shocking bigger picture. It is impossible to scientifically prove what this picture exactly is, but there's overwhelming evidence of 'something'.

It seems we're stuck in this reality for now, whatever outside reality exists with outside issues is already being dealt with by 1k+ IQ individuals? and humans are incapable of dealing with all our issues ourselves. They intentionally hide and evading scientific observation is a trivial matter. We are stupid innocent space babies, the final scene in 2001: A Space odyssey could very well be the most accurate description of the human condition ever produced.

EDIT:

I wasn't trying to argue ""something that we have absolutely no evidence of must be hiding""

rather ""There is a non-trivial chance non-human intelligence exists and has interacted with this world. Here are some logical implications we need to consider because of this""

EDIT:

Our current science cannot explain the full nature of reality, specifically, the relationship between consciousness and physical existence.

You cannot fully understand what consciousness is from studying a physical brain. As Penrose said; 'consciousness is not a computation' I agree.

Since we know consciousness exists, we can conclude a broader reality outside the purview material science exists; we can explore this reality via thought experiments to gain potentially useful information that we cannot do through examining the physical world with our physical senses or scientific sensors.

To do this we need to temporarily suspend our disbelief in anything and keep an open mind. Obviously a simple conclusion to some questions is ""non-human intelligence may not exist and hasn't interacted with us at all"" Let's ignore that and suppose it's false for now - can't be proven either way.

Some of these thought experiments would include questions such as:

why is there no public interaction between ETs and humans?

What reasons would they have to be discrete?

why can't we cohesively prove they are here or have been here?(ignoring the obvious skeptic statement, there is SOME evidence)

Is there more to our history than academia tell us?

Why does there seem to be things that exist which our scientific worldview says shouldn't exist?

Could there be a deeper reality behind this one? If so what does that mean?","My take on the implication of Non-human intelligence being real and what it means to our worldview,"

The word stars if you use the Interlinear concordance translates to Greek word : Astēr  g792 in the strong translation which in each instance it is being used is ALWAYS  translated to celestial beings, angels and fallen angels or demons. It clearly says that during this time of terror the stars of the heavens (the second heaven where satan and his followers were banished which is the universe, space, ect) will fall onto the earth like a fig tree being shaken. This tells me that these demons or aliens will no longer have their place in the second heaven and be banished to Earth. But apparently not all of them just some!

My immediate reaction was to throw myself against the wall to get as far away from it as I can. It was staring at my brother the whole time and didn’t even acknowledge me as I walked past it. My brother told me that it was really hard to focus on its face because he said “everything was vibrating”. When I turned the light on it was gone. We didn’t sleep the whole night.

Producer John Houseman noticed that at about 8:32 pm ET, CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a telephone call in the control room. Taylor left the studio and returned four minutes later, ""pale as death"", as he had been ordered to interrupt ""The War of the Worlds"" broadcast immediately with an announcement of the program's fictional content. However, by the time the order was given, the program was already less than a minute away from its first scheduled break, and the fictional news reporter played by actor [Ray Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Collins_(actor)) was choking on poison gas as the Martians overwhelmed New York.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)#cite_note-Houseman_RT-1):404

**Actor** [**Stefan Schnabel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Schnabel) **recalled sitting in the anteroom after finishing his on-air performance.

It was a show to witness.**""[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)#cite_note-Independent-35)

During the signoff theme, the phone began ringing. Houseman picked it up and the furious caller announced he was mayor of a Midwestern town, where mobs were in the streets.

aliens,"A little about me and my past.

So from an early age I have always had a strong interest in space science, physics, quantum mechanics, etc.  Anything in this area.  I remember reading books fairly advanced as a 10 year old around these areas.  I have an above average IQ 138 but I understand that's not even genius level. Never really understood why but just fascinated by anything related.  I also had an interest in aliens and remember distinctly believing in them prior to age 8.

During my childhood while living in Louisiana, both my sisters recall an incident of their room lighting up so bright in the middle of the night. They say it was like daylight in their room and absolutely no noise. They both remember this event and the next day their was a burn circle in the back yard but just a ring, not the center (I do not remember the event but remember the circle).  My parents confirmed the circle in our yard where the grass died.  (Circle was about 20ft)  We had a very large yard.

My Dad has told me a similar story about when he was around 20.  Same thing but was going to college in New Orleans and living with his brother..  He was with his brother, same thing, bright light, no noise.  The next morning him and his brother woke to papers everywhere around the room (like they were blown around) and with the exact same experience. No memory of being abducted but they believe it was aliens.

Fast forward to me.  I have a bad back T3, T4, T5 messed up and rib dislocation in chest since I was 20.  I messed it up when I went through the 18X program, same program Snowden went through where he broke his legs (no I don't know him, we were 3 years apart.) I discharged as well. I had that pain for about 8 years.  It hurt every single day of my life at that point. Pretty intense.

Here is the good part:

About the 8 year mark of back pain. I went to bed as normal.  When I did, I had the most real ""dream"".  I remember it still as if it happened yesterday (now 8 years later).  So vivid.  I just can't explain.  In my ""dream"", I woke up in somehow what I knew was a space ship.  It was brown walls that looked organic but like intentional and dirt floors.  Dry hard dirt.  I look up and see a large light brown ""Grey"", about 12 feet total, but he was kind of sitting on the ground. Legs bent kind of like A shape bend. No expression on his face.  The only thing I remember it saying was ""this will help your back"" but he didn't say it, it was inside my head, so telepathic.  The next imagine I had is the putting a medium brown animal (or what I would felt was as an animal) on my back.  It looked like the creature from the matrix that goes down their throat but organic/animal.  They placed it on my back.  Thats all I remember. I woke up the next day and had 0 back pain for 9 months straight.  It came back but only about 5% of what it was. Still to this day it's pretty much healed.

I could point the figure I saw in a line up no problem. I can still see him right bow in my head.  It's the strangest stuff.

I think I was abducted then and I think I was abducted when I was young.  I believe I have a hard metal ball in the web of thumb and pointer finger.  It's half the size of a green pea.  I have never gotten it checked out but I can feel it even right now while I write this.

The next night, my wife and I were getting ready for bed, and I had gone into the kitchen to grab a drink, and I saw this tall white being standing on our balcony staring at me and it took off and got onto our roof in less than 2 seconds, and I had freaked out and ran to tell my wife. 

Later that night, the same being was in our room, crouched down in front of our dresser staring at us. My wife freaked out, grabbed her phone and shined her light at it to get a better look at it and it vanished. She says it was there for like 2 minutes, and she cant remember if anything happened during that 2 minutes.

aliens,"Hello! 

Just a quick question here, not sure if it’s all been discussed and hashed out already, but what’s going on with this?Lazar is, IMO, a relatively credible and reliable individual when it comes to his testimony regarding the reverse engineering of several alien craft. He seems like a plausible guy, and despite the fact that there is little evidence to substantiate his claims, his consistently calm and honest persona makes me think that he might genuinely be telling the truth.

One thing really bugs me however, and it’s this weird prosecution on his record regarding “pandering” (whatever that means). Supposedly he had some involvement with arranging a brothel for a group of sex workers, but it just seems so at odds with his character… It’s worrying because I’m quite close to believing the guy, but an inconsitency in character of this magnitude makes me think maybe there’s something left unsaid. 

Just to clarify, I don’t think engaging with sex workers, as a client or employer, is particularly immoral. I just think it’s worlds apart from the image he has curated over the years, and lends some weight to the skepticism surrounding him.

I appreciate that this is exactly the sort of thing his detractors would allege he was involved in in order to undermine his authenticity, but to my understanding Bob has confirmed his complicity in all the allegations, and attested that he was in fact guilty.

If anybody has an explanation, or even just knows a bit more about it, I’d be really interested to hear your take. It’s just such a bizarre allegation to have thrown in amongst all the other things he’s know for I feel like there’s more to be found here.

aliens,"The MSM has ceased all coverage of UFO/UAP after a weak pentagon report came out and told us less than nothing.

I’ve been saying it for a while now, it’s probably our technology that was reverse engineered from an advanced alien/extra-dimensional, crypto-terrestrial, or ultra-dimensional craft. (It also could be from an advanced human civilization).

Having said that, the government would most likely end the world or create mass panic before they gave us the technology these craft possess. To control space and time through gravity manipulation gives them god-like power over us. Would any group of sociopaths give that up?

I think we’re seeing all the negativity in the news to distract us from the fact that our military industrial complex is at least 100 years ahead of the current state-of-the-art. They’re also lying to us about our place in existence.

I'm no expert on the matter, but I know we put lights on our aircraft to avoid collisions, aid in identification, and help aircraft controllers on the ground.

Unfortunately i can't say i have something spicy to offer, this is really just a question.
I think about 5 years ago i saw a video on youtube that really shocked me
This guy had heard noise if i remember correctly coming from his basement and he went to film, there was a grey creature, all hairless, lean and crouched behind something, i think it was trying to hide, when the camera was on it , it looked at it and its eyes were glowing red, i don't know if that's because of the flash from the camera or if that's it's actual eyes, but in a matter of a second it ran away and that's all i remember
I can't recall exactly what it looked like, but it didn't have huge eyed and the weird features like your stereotypical alien does, but it's a really blurry image in my mind, it for sure didn't look human though and that is apart from the grey skin.
But i just remember it looked so real, like it can't be faked, but i was 14 years old when i saw it alot of things could go over my head but the way i remember it, it feels like that was a real unknown specie that this guy filmed, hiding in his basement, it didn't look like makeup, and if i really remember correctly i think it flead at a speed that seemed faster than a human could, it was just as scared if not more scared than the guy.
I've looked everywhere on youtube for this video because i want to see it again,but to no avail i couldn't find it
Maybe it's fake maybe it's real.

aliens,"Sooo I started watching Ancient Aliens a couple nights ago online and some of the discoveries were just mind blowing. I do think it's utterly biased and irrational in places but overall, many of the discoveries only make sense in terms of some other advanced intelligence at the wheel. 

Thunderbolts Project channel on youtube has a series of 5 documentaries about two primary topics: ancient civilizations and how they fared before and after global catastrophic events caused by shifting planetary orbits. 

I had to watch them a couple times because something was kicking me in the head and I needed to take a beat and then go watch again to see if it was my imagination or if I misunderstood something. 

Nope.

The docs go on at length about the ancients viewing planets as gods and not some mythical beings. That'll tick off most religious sorts but they need to learn to update their ideas in light of new information. Anyway, they discussed the god Mars and accounted for ancient civilizations associating it with the deep red scar on ""his"" face...which is only possible if the planet Mars was close enough to the earth to see the scarring up close and personal. 

But that flies in the face of every single thing we think we understand about the cosmos...but if the things we think we know about the cosmos is the correct explanation then it basically has to mean ancient civilizations were a truly luck lot to be able to all - and by all I mean worldwide, people who didn't even know that anyone else existed anywhere else or that there even was an ""anywhere else"" - managed to figure out one planet they all called Mars - or their word for it - had a gigantic scar across most of his his face...and they all worked that shit out off of tiny points of light far into space above. 

All the stories of the gods pointed to cataclysmic events unfolding and how people managed to document their lives, the time period, their culture...and every single one of them included strange hybrid type of beings coming here from the skies. 

The more this sank in, the more exciting it became. The planets being in a different configuration is what the ancient people were documenting, and those Thunderbolts docs make a solid case, more solid than most NASA funded docs about things - that these configurations worked well for a long time...and then they became unstable, and that instability coincides with the same stories of interactions with these hybrid creatures and the building of massive monolithic structures considered by EU folks to have been bunkers...not memorials to kings out of ego. They were shelters for their people, they were bunkers, they were ""arcs""...and the only possibly way they could've anticipated the need for it is a more advanced intelligence who gave them this information and helped them build these things.

Eventually just about everything was wiped out in the cataclysmic events and the surviving humans may well have been surviving alien / human hybrids who still had some lingering understanding of the ancient languages to build on it and turn the dark world into a thriving network of colonies, communities, transportation networks and increasingly modernized societies. 

It just came so clear that all these advances took place after the last Ice Age...and they happened rapidly as the populations exploded across the world and people realized they were not the only ones around. 

Something happened though that put the entire concept of UFOs in the mix. The earliest civilizations whose documentation was discovered depicted these ideas to those of a later period. But something ELSE had to happen for the technologies to explode the way they have in such a rapid brief period of time, just a couple hundred years or so we've gone from exorcising demons to putting rovers on Mars.

Whether it originally came from him or not, when I heard Bob Lazar make the comment that he was under the impression these craft were recovered from an archeological dig and were about 10k or so years old, it made total sense and fit the same timeline as proposed in the EU model. Granted, they're speculative but it makes sense...they found alien technology and managed to figure out some of how it worked and began experimenting with and modernizing technologies...and here we are. Not a new idea...but it's one that has so much more solid foundation with the electric universe model.

So filled with potential, right down to telepathic communication, teleportation and alternate realities or portals.

Consider that if the planets were so close people on earth could easily see the scarring across the face of the red planet we came to know as Mars, if they knew where Saturn was located at the center of the pole (before it went away)...if they could see these planets that close then it means if advanced life was on any of them, they could've easily gotten here from there. They could've been the beings that came as ""saviors"" of the people, and the mating or pairing of them gave rise to these hybrid sorts of creatures. 

An electric universe would have active electrical currents everywhere that perhaps some alien race is making use of to teleport from there to here, or using that energy to power their craft, and even manipulating it to disrupt or enhance our own biological systems right down to an internal communication process teleporting information from one place to another. 

And that dreams are not images on a screen like a movie we're watching, it's not a 2d internal experience...but a whole other reality or location (realm, dimension, place, etc.) that we, who are non biological at our true nature, can go to while the biological bodies are put in AFK mode, basically.

It even works if all of this is a simulation. How is it powered? The brain farm called earth. We are the pods housing the brains that require the harnessing and manipulation of energy to create and manifest content in this space. It's all powered by us and the electrical energy of the world itself. 

Just food for thought.

aliens,"I think that the hyper-intelligent machine argument is good, but having something capable of learning is probably somewhat paradoxical. This is because if you're creating something like a self-replicating resource harvester, there's no reason for that to be capable of any significant learning or modification of the behavior. These are created for the purpose of havesting resources, not for any sort of thinking or creativity.

These sorts of things would just spread like a virus, harvesting planets, self-replicating, without really changing at all. They would technically be subservient and responsive to some AI out there, but for whatever reason if these replicated faster than the AI could manage, due to unforeseen circumstances or phenomenon, then these would keep keep on going, harvesting planets, without anyone to come collect the resources. 

Probably shipping these resources back to a collection point, but ultimately unable to really stop self-replicating and consuming planets, despite having no real overlord that is managing them due to collapse or predation by other machine species. 

If these robots main AI source was attacked and overpowered, that thing would likely wipe all memory and other sorts of things as a defense mechanism, hoping to protect other replicated AI hubs that exist elswhere. If this predatory machine species wiped out a significant number of these AI hubs, then the harvesting machines under their power would ultimately be without a master, working for nothing, and without the information as to their location or the resource drop points, then the predatory species wouldn't be able to collect the harvest either.


It's just a thought though.","There are probably numerous flawed self-replicating machine species in the universe, just sitting idle on planets, having run out of harvestable materials and energy"

aliens,"This happened a few years ago , and apparently the military were in town at the time so I'm not really sure what this was.

Me and two of my friends went out for a ride in the woods to smoke some weed and hang out , they were drunk but I didn't have anything to drink.
We got to a good enough spot and we were all out of my truck at the time talking and then the whole forest seemed to light up with very bright white light . My friend said it looked like a lightning bolt but I didn't see it and there was no sound at all.

After that we got freaked out and left towards town through the trail. Eventually we came up to an opening next to a big tower and I could see a light at the top of the tree line , it was getting brighter so I think it was coming closer but it never came from out the treeline.

After a while watching it a random black car came flying down the road and passed us and went towards the tower , and eventually the light started to fade then the car took off just as fast and headed left towards town. I decided to follow it but when i got to the road it was already gone. I don't think it disappeared or anything it was just going really damn fast.

So that's the weirdest thing that happened to me , if anyone saw anything similar or think they know what happened let me know .",My strange experience

Theyre flipping the sensations as experienced through thr quantum particle inside the pineal gland (soul) and theb cutting them into pieces. Not sure why they keep the eyes lmfao.

Theyre hectic but CERN(?) is doing this to people which is was worse.

Anyways the quantum particle continues after death so its REALLY bad. I dont know if it was a grey or an angel that told me all this.  Unbeleivable to be honest. They made a lightnin storm anyways and grew a yellow flower and said they were Gaia lol. They also said theres another layer above the particles which involves the entanglement and interactions between vast arrays of particles, broken into two pieces, which form the universe.  Apparently, allegedly, the masculine is bein tortured and will ""wake up"" or end this particular branch of the multiverse. Hectic aliens lol.

Who are the moths? Ubek? Who are the red haired ones? Dao? I dunno, been in the pebble so long... Wew! Cry for a thousand years they said... When they realize what they did, and what they lost- for so little gain.

The particle interacts and colours other experienced sensations after mortality for eternity! They lose their place in exstacy for a quick high.... Ew. Vampiric!",Thr Greys are cutting up horses

aliens,"I posted this in the wrong place yesterday (I am a newb here) and it got deleted.  I am trying again. 

 

I was going to pose this as a question, but thought it better to present it as an argument, then let the discussion unfold as such. Any species that evolves on a planet will more or less face the same scarcity and competition for resources as life on this planet. Accordingly, I expect that when they are/were at our stage of development, they were probably no more moral or kind than we are. Over time, humans have overall become a less violent species (despite what the media may have you believe). Obviously our weapons of war have increased in power and we have done a lot of super efficient killing in the recent centuries, but I am talking about the overall tendency of the average person, and the statistics of things like how many wars are there, how much crime is there, now much hunger and disease is there.. on almost every one of those fronts, we are moving in the right directions. Now is the best time to be alive, statistically speaking.

As society has developed, We have industrialized compassion and empathy and have become far more capable at being effective at acting in line with those concepts.

We have also industrialized violence and war, but instances of those are decreasing over time. I think this points to the fact that IF a species can make it past the stage of development we are in, they will have more benevolent characteristics in general than violent characteristics, as the advancement of society beyond some points appears to be contingent upon benevolence and cooperation winning out over conflict and divisiveness. If a society does not wrangle that in, I think they have a large chance of destroying themselves. On small scales we see it... working together is almost always more effective than infighting.

The second prong of my argument has to do with eliminating scarcity. Looking at our own species, if we continue to advance like we are it is likely that we will have the technology to make all the necessary things we need to survive and thrive totally through autonomous and renewable means. The convergence of technologies like renewable energy, energy storage, robotic vision, AI, and advancements in control of dynamic complex machines (robots) are eventually going to create a super capable, powerful automated infrastructure that can sustain and maintain itself and provide everything we need to exist. I think there may some some horrible hiccups along the way, but in order to advance to the level of a true spacefaring race, we will by default have to overcome those issues and reach the potential I have outlined.

In this scenario, once scarcity is effectively elimination, and the provision for existence are readily available to everyone for free, the entire dynamic of society will be transformed. At this stage we will all likely have access to some kind of brain computer interface that will radically transform and elevate the intelligence of the average human. Since more highly educated and intelligent people tend to show less violent tendencies, we should be in great shape.

If this line of thinking is right, I think it tells us that the only kind of space faring race we should expect to encounter is going to be totally integrated with their technology, unlikely to need any resources from us, and generally benign as far as being a threat to us is concerned. I could be way off, but this seems reasonable to me and I have been thinking about it for a long time.",Why I think aliens that can make it here are likely to be benevolent or at least not harmful.
aliens,,"Believe it or not, despite the scary music, the footage itself is authentic.

aliens,I have a theory that piggybacks off another theory regarding the Greys. A lot of people seem to believe they are us from the future. With the way things are going and our advancement in technology people also seem to believe they may be part android. Perhaps They came to the past to study us to see where we went wrong. They may also want to understand what makes us different from them. What makes humans...”organic?” Maybe what made us who we are is these “souls” they’ve heard about in old writings. They abduct us and perform operations desperately trying to find the soul. Of course they’ll never find it,Greys and abductions theory
aliens,"Skinny Bob video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQCXN4o4Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQCXN4o4Ps)

Other walking EBEs in the video called ""Family Vacation"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6TLGkrfNKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6TLGkrfNKI)

This list of videos will help anyone's case in confirming or dismissing the authenticity of Skinny Bob and the other EBEs in Family Vacation. I am hoping some others might help add to it?

I did the best investigation I could to pull in examples and organize them into full CGI and motion capture, and if someone can correct a placement I'll move the video.

If you do want to add a video to the list, please comment below with the same format. I won't guarantee I will add it to the list because I am mainly looking for alien or alien-like examples around 2011, however, my list isn't perfect, I have a few non-alien-like videos, but I've tried to use my best discretion to be fair and representative.

Through this comparison one should be able to develop an average industry ability in 2011 to have possibly created the video series, and what kind of production it could have taken. For example, the lizard in Spider-Man 2012 was full CGI and extremely well done, Paul in 2011 was motion capture and also very well done. Of course these are major motion films with $100 million+ budgets (obviously less content proportions to less cost though). When student projects, at home animators, or other lower budget examples are compared, they are extremely underwhelming compared to Skinny Bob, IMO.

aliens,"Before I get into this I do not have any photo or video to show these events, I will be making an effort to take video and or photos in the coming days. So for the past month or so around generally the same time at night I’ve seen an orb of white light that floats across the sky in the distance on the same path. The first time I saw this orb of light (it was stationary)  it was very large and changing color in the same pattern from white to orange to red for give or take about 15 seconds. Then the pattern of light stopped on white and shrunk down to a tiny dot then at a slow speed moved from left to right out of sight. Since then almost every night I have seen a white orb of light moving in the same direction and height across the sky until it is out of sight. Tonight myself and a friend saw the same orb of light except it was moving the opposite direction, half way through the path the orb of light expanded to a larger size but staying the same color. After about 5 seconds or so it shrunk back down to it’s normal size and and changed directions back to left to right at a slow speed until out of sight. I hope this makes sense,if there’s anything I can clarify please do let me know and let me know what you all think it is. Thanks all.",Possible ufo sighting?? I’m not sure honestly.

aliens,"I had a dream in Spanish (native English speaker) that I was in an abnormally white hospital and gave birth to my second son (never been pregnant). My son looked very tiny and skinny and fit in my two hands. My son was taken shortly after birth because I was addicted to drugs (never been an addict). I tried to explain that I must have been drugged. The nurse then told me she was taking me to a mental hospital because they needed further testing done on me. My baby’s father and my first son, who was 3,  were sitting on a couch in the room with me. I tried to tell my son I was leaving. He said I always leave and was very mad at me. I tried to give him kisses and he wouldn’t give me any affection. He said I always leave him and it’s not fair to him because he doesn’t have a mom. I assured him I’d be back very soon and that I love and miss him. He said this is what I always say. I then tried to give my baby’s father a hug and he said “every time I hug you I fall back in love with you and you’re always gone so I won’t touch you”. I then put my new born baby in a car seat who was suddenly 3 months old. 
I have NEVER wanted biological kids and am quite convinced I’m sterile as I don’t have a normal cycle and never have had a normal cycle. (I’m talking 3-4 periods a year - there’s nothing wrong with my hormones.)

In the dream I somehow was able to run away. The night was abnormally black. I was being chased and felt like I was in the purge but that the things chasing me were higher than the FBI. I saw a garage door closing and rolled through it. The garage had people in it. I ran into the house and locked the door. I remember thinking “how did the door lock when there’s tape covering the lock?” (We have tape covering the lock so we don’t get locked out of the house when using the garage). I ran into the closet of my office and hid into a box and threw clothes over top of myself. Someone I knew came in and found me and they were working for the chasers. I looked at them and put my finger over my lips and whispered please. The person opened the window and said nobody is here. The chasers were pissed. The guy was shot. 

I woke up in a terrible sweat and very thirsty. I was in only my underwear and hardly covered by my blankets (I have three on my bed as I am always cold). I grabbed my drink and it poured all over my face. I went to the bathroom but was uneasy on my feet. I then went to check the thermostat because of how hot I was. It was 64 degrees in my house but I was sweating. 

I went back to bed, without my blankets on, and woke up in the same dream back in the hospital. My biological father was called because he was the only relative they could get ahold of. I am adopted but knew my father until I was 14. My father was NOT my biological father. He was wearing a tie and a button up and sounded like a professor. My bio father is a drug addict still. I am 28. 

This morning while showering I had a nose bleed. My nose never bleeds.

Not a creepy pasta or no sleep story. 

I personally thought it was a crazy dream, but I still remember it so vividly and while talking it out to my friend she mentioned the possibility of an abduction. 

Is it possible I was abducted or is this a crazy dream?",Possible alien abduction?
aliens,"About 9 years ago, when I was probably 18 or 19, I worked at a local park in Maryland.  My co worker and I were closing the park for the night and as we were about to lock up the main gate, someone stopped us and needed to get in.  Their friend was kayaking and couldn’t get back up the creek the way they came (not sure why) so we let them back and waited for them to return.  

While we were waiting, we were listening to music and just looking around.  Up in the sky, we noticed 8 or 9 reddish orbs (pretty sure it was 9).  They weren’t exactly lights and more like orbs,because even as far away as they were they appeared 3D and round if that makes sense.  

They sort of hovered there for about 30 seconds.  Then, suddenly, they started moving rapidly in different directions, like one on top of the other, zig zag, etc.  

Finally, one by one, they sort of sped up quickly, moved diagonally, and vanished.  

I’m sorry I don’t have a picture... for the life of me I wish I had taken one at the time but it was so interesting to see I didn’t want to look away.  

Has anyone seen something like this?  I’m usually a skeptic of “UFO” stuff but this really shook me.  People have tried to tell me it was a local military base’s (we have one a few counties away, so not really local) helicopters, but I feel like the way these things moved it couldn’t have been helicopters.

aliens,"As more research come out about our beautiful earths magnetic field I would like to propose my theory 

[NASA research on magnetic “Dent”](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-researchers-track-slowly-splitting-dent-in-earth-s-magnetic-field)
Now this dent in the magnetic field is insignificant but it plays a role in my story but we will start with [the flip](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2019/10/earths-magnetic-field-flipped-more-times-scientists-thought) which was thought to take tens of millions of years but now now it’s thought that the next one is a few hundred years or so [here ](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/48333-magnetic-field-flip-within-100-years.html). Which I think is awesome but I feel like there’s other reasons for why it does. 

I’m going to start with the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) (crater cause by the asteroid that hit earth and killed dinosaurs, I believe the crater was and entry point for some form of out of world object placed there by aliens in form of an asteroid.

The reasoning is that they can use the object to alter earths ozone layer well more protect it from the solar winds which would rip the ozone apart, the theory is that because Venus and Mars don’t have magnetic fields is because they’re not in [Circumstellar habitable zone](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/323/goldilocks-zone/) (the godly locks zone) so aliens put the magnetic field there and yes i know there was a magnetic field before then Because how would the dinosaurs live the way they did but there was a magnetic field but the field was collapsing 
And they can’t just send an asteroid into out planet with no proof of it working so they tested is on other planets in our solar system first being Jupiter which was way to strong and would affect life to greatly so they made the magnetic field weaker.

Why would they do this well I don’t know but I want to say they keep and eye on us and are secretly keeping us for captivity and we have proof that they keep and eye on us [DoD UFO](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/newsbeat-52455169) was published to public not too long ago and I think this is some sort of camera drone

Lately I've been going through the old Art Bell episodes on Youtube and ran across this interview today.  I've been trying to find theories that fit why the government has so vehemently been covering up the subject. Of course the theory with the most evidence is greed, they want the technology for themselves. Another theory, though, is less malicious.  Both Tom Delonge and Jimmy Carter were told something by the government that altered their whole view of disclosure from opening it all up to being in turmoil about it.  Tom said that he didn't sleep for 3 days and they said Jimmy Carter simply went in his office and started crying. Lately, I've been subscribing to the interdimensional hypothesis as the source of the phenomenon due to the work of John Keel and Jaques Valee and everything that has come to light at skinwalker ranch and all that jazz. I was casually listening to this episode of C2C and heard Whitley Streiber mentioning a hypothesis (time around 10:00 into the video) that was made by a physicist John Von Neumann that there is a trip wire in that if the human consciousness starts to believe they are real, then it would basically  open large gateways into our dimension from theirs and they would be able to very easily move into our dimension.   Are they trying to accomplish this and we are fighting it? Could that be the reason that this is kept so secret? Are Aliens from other parts of our universe aware of this and be trying to keep humanity from hitting this ""trip wire""? Very interesting theory.... Makes me think back to Luis Elizondo's mentioning the ""Chains of the sea"" being a interesting book to read about the phenomenon.",Art Bell C2C with Whitley Streiber

aliens,"I am only posting my story in hopes to see if anyone else may have experienced anything similar before. I have attempted to search for this as a common phenomenon and have not yet turned up  anything. 
Over the summer I had a very legitmate UAP sighting from my front yard while out stargazing. A amber colored light appeared from the blackness of space, remained stationary for a brief moment, and then proceeded to take off at a very high rate across the tree line and then faded out like turning off a flashlight. This was not a lightning bug or commercial aircraft. It was distinctly moving behind  branches of trees from a far distance and moved at an insane rate of speed. I had been thinking to myself prior to the sighting how awesome it would be to get to see one first hand. Within a few seconds, my wish was granted. 
Later that weekend I was using my shop vac to clean out my filthy daily driver. I had just finished with the vacuum that was fully powered off and removed the ear plugs from my ears. As I was wrapping up the electric plug on the vacuum something wizzed past my head. It sounded small and close. Like when a bee buzzes by you the way you can sort of feel the vibration of it wings as you hear it once it's close enough. The noise though was like nothing biological. If I could describe it I would say that it sounded like a tiny jet turbine that had an electric drive instead of combustion based. I do mean tiny sounding. Comparable to the volume of a bee flying. I never saw anything around me. It happened so quickly. There was an obvious doppler effect to it. Which tells me that it was moving very fast and originated from a singular source as it came from behind my right shoulder and passed over. I scanned the skies for anything and they were empty. Has anyone else experienced anything of the sort, or could I just be mistaken about my experience? I'll never forget that noise though.",Strange experience in my driveway after a UAP sighting earlier that week.

aliens,,Predator VS Alien?!? (GONE SEXUAL)
aliens,"Back in 1997 a kid told us in class he had seen an alien t.v. show that had scared him out of his mind. He was in fact so scared that he told us he left the t.v. on all night as he was too scared to get up from bed to go turn it off.  I don't remember much about what he described about the show back then other than he though it was real (not fiction). His reaction to it always made a big impression on me.

A couple years later as I'm browsing through the different t.v. channels I run into the same alien show. After a couple minutes of watching, I knew it was the exact same one because I had made some connections to what the kid had told us a few years prior. I don't remember what those things were but I was 100% sure it was the same t.v. show. I only watched this show that one time and never again, but just like the kid's story, it has always made an impression on me. I've recently started to think about it and want to re-watch it after all these years but can't remember the name or really, much about it. What I do remember is below.

It's presented as a real story but it's obviously fictional. 

The main setting was a family home with a foresty outdoors and it mostly takes place at night.

The show is self contained in one episode that lasts about 30 or 40 minutes. Might be a part of a bigger series with a different theme each episode but I don't really think so.

I remember balls of light flying at high speeds inside the house (I think these were the aliens taking a different form?). Whenever the lights would hit a person, the person would die. 

By the end, I don't think there were any human survivors.

No matter where we ended up they would always find us, it wasn't something that just affected me, it happened to my wife, and to my kids, so yes it was happen to a family of 4.

We used to call them inter dimensional beings; they would appear and then disappear. You could sometimes catch them from the side of your eye and then when you turned around they would be gone. 

My kids would see them in their rooms, in the bathroom, and around the kitchen. They were little like kids size.  My kids were in middle school and they experience all these visits and spent their entire young life dealing with it as best as they could.

Almost nightly we would feel our body become paralysis and we couldn’t move, scream, or call out for help.  We knew someone was in the room, then it would be over.

One time I was laying down on my side and fell asleep, I woke up the sound of static electricity crackling, I opened my eyes but could not move my body, at the same time I had a presence that someone was in the room. 

I took a look around and on my body I saw what appear to be blue static electricity discharge crackling around me, I immediately tried to yell for help my mouth would open but no noise would come out of it. 

I started to struggle and I was able to break free and then the electrical field disappeared the static discharge stopped

We moved again to a different town 360 miles away, we were left alone for 7 years until it started back up, when they returned it was different, one night after watching the show ***Haunted 2018 S01 E05 on Netflix*** we went to sleep for the night, my wife was awaken by me struggling to breathe, I was struggling for air, and of course I couldn’t move or make noises, the other issue is she witness me levitating 4 inches off the bed and then as she reached to wake me up, I slammed into the bed and caused the bed to shake,   We just look at each other with a WTF look on our faces. 

We have since then learned to ignore anything that happens, After a while we noticed they left us alone.

aliens,"Hello everyone. I always feel it is most important to begin a story by admitting why it shouldn't be believed. This is my second post ever as I have just begun to share some of my stories with others, perhaps no longer as fearful of the criticism I will receive for doing so. 

When I was just a kid, probably 9 or 10, my dad and I were fishing one of the largest lakes in our immediate area, about 45 minutes from where we lived. We were fishing around midnight for larger, predatory fish that only fed at night. We had been fishing for about three hours and were considering leaving, when suddenly a large shape started hovering above the water. 

It started out about a half mile away from us. It was mostly shapeless in the night's sky except for the lights on its underside. Soon, however, it began to draw nearer to us. 

We watched in silence as the object started to come toward us- probably not toward us as much as just blindly heading in our direction toward shore. It stopped about 80 yards or so from us, over the water, and shone down a bright beam of light. I remember watching the beam of light shine down from the figure, it may have been triangular or circular in shape- I don't trust my young memory to say. As the beam basked the water in light, it seemed as if the water started to rise within the beam  toward the object. 

Eventually the beam cut off, and the thing sped off at an incredible speed. It was me who broke the silence, saying, "" Was that  a UFO?""... My dad wasn't someone to believe in such a thing and replied in a stammer, ""I..I don't know, kid."". We haven't discussed the incident in years, I don't even know if he's decided to keep it within his memory, but I remember it. 

I believe the most important part of this story, the most definite thing cemented in my brain, is how silent it was. There was absolutely no noise whatsoever. I've tossed and turned it in my mind for a decade now and a piece of me has accepted that it was some stealth jet piloted by the Air Force, but that doesn't seem to make sense of it. The entire incident was so strange.",A Beam At The Lake

**The &lt;3 Letter.**

Dear aliens,

I hope you’re still alive,

But if not, please read my Letters.

**Comet X.** Now, my mission is to be a human and to win the human prize, human speaking, my dream is to be more human. And I’ve got a lot of theories about humans and how to be a human, and I think I could get a lot of human prize. But unfortunately, I can’t share them with anyone because I don’t have any human friends. So, I would like to share some of them with you to get your alien opinions, and maybe get some comets back.

**Comet &lt;3.** And today I would like to share with you one of my favourite theories that is called, The Theory of Love. And I wrote this theory for my imaginary girlfriend that I love a lot. She’s very nice, and cute, and beautiful and I love her very much. She’s more beautiful than the sun, the moon, and more beautiful than all the stars you can put together, she’s more beautiful than a galaxy. And I love her very much, the universe is not big enough to tell how much I love her, she’s everything to me. And to show her how much I love her I wrote this theory for her. And I really hope one day she’ll read it, and will send me a comet back. So, here is my Theory of Love, please take a look, and if you like it, please leave me a comet.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Human Thought Experiment &lt;3.** But before we start, let’s have a human thought experiment. So, let’s imagine that you’re a human and you have a human girlfriend or a boyfriend, depending of what type of human you want to be. Now, let’s say that one day you come down to earth, human speaking, you’re coming back from a long trip, and you’re very tired. And all you need is just a hug and someone to tell you that they love you. Instead, the human you love, wants to roast you, and to make you barbeque. Human speaking, they start to make a lot of drama. They want to know if you love them and they start to ask you a lot of questions like: “Do you really love me?” or “How much do you love me?” or “If you really love me, why did you do, or why you didn’t do this and that?”. And they also start throwing around a lot of accusations that might be very true, or might not be true at all. So, what do you do?

1.  **Brush it off.** Say something like, of course I love you, I told you that a million times.
2. **Start an argument.** Say something like, we’ve been together for more than X days/months/years, why do you still keep asking me that? And if you don’t trust me, why are you still with me?
3. **Bully them.** Call them ugly / fat / stupid, and tell them why they should be very grateful that you’re their boyfriend / girlfriend.
4. **Start a fight.** You have to show them who is the boss.
5. **Ignore them.** Tell them that you don’t really care of what they think, or how they feel. And just do your thing like you don’t even notice them.
6. **Change the subject.** Start talking about something else. You can talk about weather, markets, politics, or anything you like, just not about love.
7. **Break down in tears.** Start crying… You worked very hard all day, and that’s how they treat you?
8. **Build a rocket.** Just build a rocket, and just move to another planet.
9. **Dump them.** Why do you have to put up with them when you can just dump them and find someone else to love?

&amp;#x200B;

**Comet &lt;33.** Now, I don’t know what you would do, but if I would be a human and if I would have a girlfriend, I would write a theory of love for her, just to show her how much I love her. And here is my Theory of Love, please leave me a comet and tell me if you like it.

**The Human Thought Experiment &lt;33. The Experiment of Love.** Now, I would like to test this theory in reality, but unfortunately, I don’t have a test subject, so I will just make another human thought experiment. But if you have a human girlfriend, boyfriend or someone you love, you can test my theory with them, and tell us if it works. And all you have to do, is to make 2 copies of the Human Test of Love [from here](https://twitter.com/h_p_o_q_o_u/status/1223658400166371329), one for you and one for your boyfriend/girlfriend or for someone you love and take the test. The test is very simple, it consists of 4 questions. So, answer first, both of you, the first 2 questions, then switch your tests and then answer the next 2 questions from the each other’s tests. When you’ve done, just switch back your tests and do the math. To know which formula to use, just check the conditions on your test. If you meet those conditions then you can use the Formula of Love for Humans that you’ll find on the bottom page of your test. If not, you’ll have to use the Alien Formula, or just take the [Alien Test](https://twitter.com/h_p_o_q_o_u/status/1223658027875819520). If you have any problems with it or if you have any questions, just shoot me a star, or just leave us a comet with your test results and I will take a look at them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comet 15.** Now, to give you an example, and to show you how this works, I did this thought experiment with my hypothetical girlfriend. So, I bought my imaginary girlfriend a bunch of flowers and a very expensive dress. This cost me 160 unicorns, 150 for the dress and 10 for the flowers. Well, it’s true that the dress didn’t fit her very well, but who cares, the most important thing they say, is to have a human intention. Anyway, after that I invited her to a very fancy restaurant and we had a really good time together. And if it wouldn’t be for the 123 bill that came after that, I would say that it was a very perfect dinner. After that I asked her if she wants to come with me to my little ship to watch some movies and to play some games together, and she was very excited to come. So, we went back to my ship, and started to watch an alien movie. And while we were watching a movie and cuddling together, she asked me if I love her. So, I gladly pulled up my new shiny Test of Love because I was very convinced that after everything, I’ve done for her my love stats would jump through the roof. But the tests results didn’t turn up what I was expecting. Our test results showed us that I only love her 1.1%, meaning that I don’t really love her, and now I’m very confused. So, can you take a look please at my [test results](https://twitter.com/h_p_o_q_o_u/status/1223658752139759616), and tell me what’s wrong with my relationship, and how to fix it?

&amp;#x200B;

**BBQ &lt;3. What is love?** Now, I’m not an expert in love, but I know a lot of xAliens. And according to them the Love is just an emotion. And because it’s an emotion, it might be really hard sometimes to understand how it works, especially if you’re driven by emotions. And to understand love, we need to remove all our emotions. So, let’s remove our emotions for a second, and let’s look at this from a science point of view.

And to make it very simple, the human brain doesn’t speak human, human speaking the brain doesn’t speak English. The brain is just an electric device that has a number of sensors, and it just reacts to the data it receives from them. And the love is basically an emotion wave that the brains use to connect and communicate with each other. And like any wave, the emotion is not a straight line, it has ups and downs, highs and lows, and it can travel through space and time. However, the emotion is much different than a traditional wave, because it’s not a wave in a traditional way but rather a message sent through a combination of many different traditional waves put together.

But, to make it super simple, let’s think about a radio. That’s just a small human device that the humans use for entertainment. Now, if you’ve never seen a radio in your life, it might be really hard for you to understand what it is, what it is used for, or how it works. But to use a radio is very simple, you just need to know 2 things: you need to know how to use the volume and the frequency. And that’s exactly what love is. The love is like a radio, and to understand it, you just need to know how to use the intensity, and the frequency.

**BBQ 14. What is the intensity?** The intensity of a wave is basically the volume button on your radio, and it’s the pitch, or how loud a sound can be. The intensity of an emotion is basically the volume of a specific emotion you send or receive from a specific source. To translate to human, if you love someone you have to show them that you love them. And if they don’t see it, you need to raise the volume and to show them louder. That might be very straightforward to you, but you’ll be surprised how many aliens don’t really understand this. So, for example, if you have a girlfriend and you only take her once a month or only once a year to a very expensive restaurant, then she might be worried that you don’t really love her, even if you spend a lot when you take her out. So, instead of taking her once a month to a very expensive place and spend a fortune, better take her more often to a cheaper place, or just buy some products and just cook a dinner together. It might not make any difference to your wallet, but for the girl this might mean a lot. Different brains can react to the same situation in different ways, and the message you want to send might not be the same message they will receive. And if your girlfriend/ boyfriend asks you if you really love them, don’t brush it off, don’t take it lightly. Take it very seriously, and just raise the volume.

**BBQ 15. What is the frequency?** Have you ever read a book or just an article and instantly felt a deep connection or even fell in love with the author of the book or with the character of the story? Or have you ever met someone and you instantly felt like you know each other for ages, even though you’ve just met, and you’ve never seen each other in your lives? And that’s exactly what a frequency is. On a radio for example, a frequency is basically a specific type of a wave you use to listen to a specific radio station. Now, when it comes to the human brain, every brain works on a specific frequency, so when you read an article or a book written on a frequency you use, you instantly relate and you make an instant connection. Or when you meet someone whose brain works on a very similar frequency than you, then you feel an instant connection with them. Now, a big misconception is that for a strong relationship you need to find someone who’s compatible with you, or that you have to have a lot of things in common. But that’s not true at all. You can be very different and have absolutely nothing in common, and still have a very strong relationship, and you can be very compatible with each other and have a lot of things in common and still fail completely your relationship. The secret of a good relationship is not the perfect compatibility or how many things you have in common, but how strong connection you have. And to build a strong connection, you just need to know what frequency to use. To translate this to human, it means that if you don’t use the right frequency when you try to connect with someone, you’ll just sound like a very cheap, or a broken radio where the frequency is rubbish. And instead of clear sounds you’ll only make a lot of noise, and you’ll be very annoying to them. And no matter how high you’ll raise your volume, you won’t make it better, you’ll just make it worse.

**BBQ 16. How accurate is this test?** Well, this is a really good question, and I would like to know this too. This test worked very well for the xAliens, but I’m not sure if it works on Earth. So, if you have a real test subject, human speaking if you have a girlfriend/ boyfriend or someone you love, please take this test and let us know how it works.

**BBQ 17. What is the minimum score to pass the test?** The formula for this test is “L = if / 2 &gt; 100%”. And this formula is designed for a good and strong relationship at 100%. Human speaking, to pass the test you need to get more than 100%. Anything less than that and you should start to worry. And if you failed the test, just look over the results and see what actions you can make to improve your score. If you did something and you got a lot of credit points, then just keep doing that. But if you did something and didn’t get much credit for it, then start doing less of that, or don’t do it at all. And if you did something and didn’t get any credit for it, then just stop doing it, unless they will specifically ask you to do that again. This will help you save a lot of time, and a lot of unicorns, and it will greatly improve your relationship.

**BBQ 18. My girlfriend/boyfriend, or the human I love doesn’t want to take this test with me, can I take it without them?** Well, in theory you can. But I would strongly recommend you to try to convince them to take the test with you. And only if they categorically refuse, you can take it without them. And in this case, you can use the same Test Form, the only difference is that you’ll have to answer the first 2 questions for them. And the volume in this case is zero because they didn’t even want to make the smallest effort to take this test with you. The value you can use is 8, and that’s because you don’t really know how much they value you. Now, you might think that the value should be zero because you might think that they don’t value you at all. But unless they specifically tell you that, you just can’t assume. The reason why it works this way is because the value can be positive or negative, but it’s almost never truly zero. And if you don’t really know, then the value is unknown. And according to the xAliens the unknown has the value 8 because the 8 is the value of the infinity and the infinity is unknown. And yes, I know that’s very weird, but that’s because the love is not really human, the love is very alien.

**BBQ 19. My relationship is broken. How this test can help me?** In theory, the love is like a muscle, and if you don’t use your muscles regularly you can lose your power. And to keep in shape you just need to exercise more often. Now, this test is designed not only to show you how much you love each other, but also what to do to improve your relationship. And if you follow the instructions, and improve your score to 100% or higher, then you should fall in love with each other again. So, if your relationship is broken and if you want to fix it, then what do you have to lose? Just try this test and let’s see what happens. This way you’ll not only help us test my theory, but this might improve your relationship as well. And I would really love to see how this works for you.

**BBQ 20. What’s the difference between the alien and the human test/formula?** In theory there’s no difference. They’re both the same. The human formula is just a simplified form of the original xAlien formula. And the only difference between them is that the human test/formula is designed for humans and for normal human relationships, where the alien one is designed for aliens and for more complicated alien relationships. Human speaking, the human test and formula is much easier to use and not so complicated. And if you’re not an alien, and you don’t have an alien relationship, then you don’t really have to worry. Just use the human test.

**BBQ 21. Nobody can measure love?!** Well, I don’t really agree with that. Because if you can measure the size of the universe and the speed of light, then I’m sure there should be a way to measure the love as well. And if you can’t measure it, then maybe there’s nothing left to measure there. But maybe you’re right, and maybe nobody can really measure love. And that’s exactly the reason why at least I have to try it.

**BBQ X. what is a BBQ?** BBQ is an acronym for the “Best Boring Questions”, or in short, a barbeque. So, how was my barbeque? Do you like it? And if you do, just send me a unicorn. But if not, then give your unicorns to nobody and nobody will be happy. And if you have a boring question, or a question that nobody can answer, then shoot me a star, or just leave me a comet, and I’ll make some barbeque for you. They say that nobody can change the world, and maybe they’re right, so let’s help nobody.

aliens,"Just now I had a strange dream that I was at home watching the sunset, but when I was looking for the sun i realized I was looking at the moon. It was very close to the sun and it had looked like there was something like an eclipse happening, but to the moon? Then I explained this to one of my sisters in the dream and she shrugged it off because it happened so quickly I doubt anybody else really caught it. The next thing I remember is looking out the front door of my house and seeing that we’re in this beautiful and peaceful outer-space where we saw hundreds of stars and a few small meteor showers pass by. Suddenly, we’re back to normal with the regular sky we all know and see, but then green and pink/purple lasers start shooting down EVERYWHERE. Me and my younger brother go outside to see what the heck is going on and we look up to see HUNDREDS of UFOs just hovering silently above us. (By the way this is the SECOND time I dream of the same hundreds of UFOs with the same lasers and the same silent hovering at the same location/time) Nobody is really freaking out about it everyone seemed very chill and just observed them and nobody was pulling out their phones to record the phenomena, except me. (Also the SECOND time I recall ever using technology in a dream, the first time was just yesterday) As I try to record the aliens I notice my younger brother is trying to stop me and this random stranger pops up and also tries to stop me and when I asked why they’re doing that my brother says “they’ll know, and they’ll get you” and so I decided against it since it seemed true, but right as I’m walking in the door of my house I said something sassy to the stranger like, “yeah, I’ll just record them the next time I feel like getting probed” and right as I said that, the stranger lunged at me and and tried to take me but I instinctively licked his face and arm??? And he suddenly started paralyzing and blistering/bubbling so fast that he was dead within a minute. I was about to celebrate when I realized my brother was also starting to blister and bubble and I was frantically googling how to stop it but it was too late. I remember mourning in this large shelter kitchen with a bunch of other strangers and one of my sisters. It seemed like I was alone since nobody else was mourning my brother. The last thing I remember is crying so hard that it woke me up in this real life. So what the heck is this all about?? Thoughts?",Recurring UFOs and lasers in dreams??

aliens,"When we think of Aliens we think of short green guys coming in peace. However if their is Aliens the majority in this time in the universe will be in the process that we started out in. Tiny, microscopic organisms. Since so many planets have so many different features and resources, human evolution was a chance of this Earth giving us what we need to make it this far. However due to how big the universe is, let alone how big our galaxy is, theirs bound to be some sort of beings whom are either at the peak of their evolution, or in the process of getting to the peak. With that said both may be able to reach out to us. Just like we imagine the tiny green guys coming in peace, that would match the peaked in evolution Alien. A few scientist have made theories on this, that if an alien is technologically smart enough or advanced to come to earth, they will either be their best selves, which would mean they would most likely no longer have negative intentions to harm others, and have patience to see how we are alive and evolving. They'd most likely just observe us or help us as a species grow and mature. On the other hand, if an Alien is smart enough to come here, but not fully evolved or have much experience, they may not understand our existence and push us aside as if we would for a tiny ant. Humans never think twice about what an ant is feeling or thinking, from what we know they don't think much at all, and have no value in life. An advanced Alien may see us just like that. Either they want to use us or the planet, or we simply are in the way of their evolution they would destroy us. NASA is very cautious with trying to make intelligent beings aware of us, as for we can't even understand what an alien would look or act like, an alien would think the same for us. In this case, the evil alien can be stopped if we show it that we are educated, valuable, and on our way to become like them: smarter or even better. We can do this by showing them how we constructed this modern world from very little what was given to us. We can show that we can see other planets by using man-made machines, we can show how we raise our children, and we can show that we are harmless even though that's not true, it's possible we can be. It would be difficult by obvious not just a language barrier but a communication barrier. We must play the what if game constantly. What if they do not or can not speak? Do they read minds? Are they poisonous to us? Do we scare them? With this said NASA hasn't recorded any other intelligent life, and has already tried to make contact by sending out radio messages, disks, etc. However, if an alien makes contact with us, it can be anyone from anywhere. Not many people are informed with these theories and cautions. That concludes our what if game to end until we get more answers. There are only so many possibilities in this universe and only one will show itself possible. Before we launch fire rockets at aliens, we should welcome them in peace, and respect, one wrong move and they could destroy us, that's if they haven't by the time we notice them. To think that we are alone in the universe is cruel, but to think that we are the more advanced in the universe is simply a joke. Yes they may be the microscopic single-cellular organisms we once were, or they may be 2x more powerful than our nuclear technology. When we play the what if game, we need to consider: what if we are the only aliens to worry about?",The Concerning Possibilities

Something smashed from behind so severely, my drone went out of control, lost the right propeller and the gimbal holder got loose and seconds later just the wire was holding the camera.

Aliens are us. Just the us from way in the future. If we do figure out time travel that means we have already time traveled. 

Aliens can be us in the future. Though why arent aliens more agressive towards Earth? Maybe if it is us from the future we are just looking out for the us in the present. 

Look at the human evolution chart. Starts with large barbaric creatures but stops at us. Though the pattern is we get smaller with larger heads. Which is how we have described aliens.

aliens,"I believe that some UFO are manmade; that some UFO may be nuts'n'bolts ET; that some UFO may be biological in nature; that some UFO may be psychic phenomena. 

But there are a lot of people that believe that UFO are physical nuts'n'bolts machines. 

If this were true, wouldn't we see an advancement in that physical technology since Roswell? To my knowledge, all documented UFO are unique, but display in many cases consistent abilities and behavior. They go fast, they stop fast, they turn fast; they disappear, reappear, split, congeal; they are silent, they are lighted, etc. 

From what I can tell,  the UFO seen mid 20th century do not differ much from what we see now. 

My point being this: if UFO were man made, i.e. government black projects, or alternatively ET-made, i.e. nuts'n'bolts physical, it would stand to reason that they would become progressively more advanced. Think of how rapidly and exponentially our own technology has advanced in 70 years or so. And we are a ""less advanced"" race than these supposed ETs. Why haven't we seen any major change in UFO tech/ behavior? 

One counterpoint I will concede to is that earlier UFO sightings (from the 40s on) include many accounts of crashes of the craft in question. This may suggest that tech IS improving, since far fewer crashes seem to be occurring nowadays. 

But what I would like to know is if there has been a trend of technological improvement observed in UFOs throughout the years since 1947. 

I feel like this question is important to discern whether the majority of cases are indeed physical, in which case a clear technological progression would be seen, or rather a psychic phenomena, in which case no such progression may be apparent.",Is there any evidence of UFOs becoming more technologically advanced through the years 1947-present?

aliens,"I believe that space is a superfluid medium and by using controlled matter - antimatter annihilation reaction, these extraterrestrial beings are creating powerful waves in this medium called gravity waves, that propels their spaceships or UFOs, just like helicopter or a submarine create powerful waves in air or water to propel themselves. I believe that matter or antimatter is formed when two powerful waves collide with each other in this space medium and create standing waves. So both matter and antimatter possess the energy of these powerful waves inside them that made them. This is the reason why so much energy is released when we convert matter into energy which are travelling waves of the medium. Also I believe that these UFOs can travel faster than the speed of light. Space is a superfluid medium  so already it creates very less resistance in the path of any traveling object but the problem is that the faster an object moves inside it, the more resistance it has to face, as space medium particles gets trapped inside them, increasing their mass. It's just like if you ride a bike fast you will feel more air resistance. And also this is the reason why fast moving objects carry more energy and mass inside them. So I believe that to circumvent this, the extraterrestrial beings use some kind of material or shield or energy shield that stops space medium particles from getting inside the UFO and keeps them away from it. Just like the windshield of a car stops air from getting inside. So they are able to travel at or faster than the speed of light without feeling any gravity forces or increase in mass.",I have a theory about how UFOs travel so quickly between space

If anything I find a bit of humor in it bc of how freaked out I was but wanted to share with you folks regardless.
So, about a week ago, I’m having a cigarette on my porch at night and I notice, what I believe, to be a strange looking drone in the distance hovering off in the distance. It moved around a bit like drones do, but was a lot faster than any drone I’ve seen first hand. I didn’t think much of it. Came out for another cigarette about 2 hours later and it was still there but on the other side of the sky, which I thought was odd considering battery power and controller range. Came out again later and it was gone. It had me thinking a bit the next night and wanted to check out some new ufo docs on amazon. I watched the Nimitz one and the one about skinwalker ranch. Of course I was in the zone after those 2 with my tinfoil hat on ha so I decide to check out another called, I think it was an older one from 2014 or so but had good reviews and had a lot of interviews with legit accounts about ufo encounters. Then...as soon as I click ‘watch now’, and I mean exactly when I clicked it, all the power to my house cut off. I was freaked out hard and froze, especially after just watching the skinwalker doc...my dogs started barking hardcore...i got up and peered out the window and no one else on my street had lost power. After about 2 minutes my power switched back on but I was too freaked out to watch something else so I decided to curl up in bed with my gf and try to sleep. If that wasn’t enough, the next morning I wake up and my freaking ears are popping like they do after a 3 hour flight. This has never happened to me before so I was a little freaked out. Later that day is when i kind of connected all 3 of these things together, of course in some tinfoil hat conspiracy, but I’m not thinking I got abducted or something. I didn’t dream that night and my gf said I didn’t snore at all, which is very odd for me. Like I said, I don’t think it was any conspiracy, I just thought y’all might find it interesting and wondered if this has happened to anyone else.

aliens,,"A UFO of almost the same exact description as the 1989-1990 Belgian triangle was witnessed in September 1960 by an Air Force veteran, his family, his neighbors, and a police officer. This significantly weakens the idea that triangular UFOs may just be secret government tech. Sources in comments."
aliens,"Here is a screenshot of the 1960 newspaper article clippings. One article comes with a drawing that perfectly resembles the standard triangle UFO: https://imgur.com/a/rQcis6a

Here is the Hartford Courant archive and the source of the article if anyone wants to dig deeper: https://courant.newspapers.com/search/#query=flying+triangle

It matches the description of the Belgian triangle in pretty much every detail, including the central revolving light. One minor difference is the color of the lights. For comparison, here is a Belgian General describing the object from the descriptions he was given: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdEALPvl_4Q&amp;feature=youtu.be

There is a myth that has gained a foothold online that suggests the triangular UFOs may be just secret government tech because they supposedly only started showing up in the 1980s. There are probably a number of reasons why this myth persists, but one of them is probably that such older triangular UFO cases haven't gotten much attention. For example, the wikipedia article on black triangle UFOs makes no mention of any triangular UFO sightings prior to 1989, except for the 1561 Nuremberg sightings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_%28UFO%29

It's *probably* the case that there are some sort of secret government aircraft of a triangular shape, but this particular variety of UFO that is silent and can instantly move at tremendous speeds, and which first started appearing at least in 1960 is much more likely to be an extraterrestrial spacecraft, in my opinion at least. 

There are other earlier reports that may be worth looking into as well, but this 1960 case seems to be one of the most solid proofs that the Belgian craft was fully operational at least in 1960.

*Our discovery shows that evolution can go in strange directions,’ Huchon said. ‘Aerobic respiration is a major source of energy, and yet we found an animal that gave up this critical pathway.’ It’s not yet clear how H. salminicola generates energy for itself, but Prof Huchon says this discovery has enormous significance in the field of evolutionary research.*

forms amount to sixty-four forms - and Sabaoth created seven archanangels that stand before it; he is the eighth, and has authority. All the 
forms amount to seventy-two. Furthermore, from this chariot the seventy-two gods took shape; they took shape so that they might rule 
over the seventy-two languages of the peoples. And by that throne he created other, serpent-like angels, called “ Saraphin,” which praise him at all times. 


The angel tells Norea that humans are from the primeval father; from above, they come from imperishable light. The archons cannot approach them because of the spirit of truth present within them; and all who have become acquainted with this 
way exist deathless in the midst of dying mankind. Still that sown element will not become known now. It will be known when the true man,within a modelled form, reveals the existence of the spirit of truth, which 
the father has sent. 
Then he will teach them about everything: And he will anoint 
them with the unction of life eternal,  given him from the un-dominated generation.
 Then they will be freed of  blind thought: And they will trample under foot death, which is of the authorities: And they will ascend into the limitless light, where this sown element belongs",Story of Adam and Eve in the Nag Hammadi library: Hypostasis of the Archons

There's no doubt that we're constantly fighting wars based on lies and a close look at forgotten history exposes this.

There's also no doubt that the government has been conducting weather modification experiments for decades and they admitted it back in the sixties. A 1958 law required they provide the president with annual reports that were passed on to Congress and the public.

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/05/forgotten-history-exposing-illusion-of.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/05/forgotten-history-exposing-illusion-of.html?fbclid=IwAR10aw_QcqVfzKsKvHHjmt_kq7sHhgLHvx05WjO8QgeiRahMEgIfTEDFJ00)

This was revoked in 1968, so their activities since then haven't been adequately reported; but it's clear that these experiments continue, even if highest profile conspiracy theories are often flawed.

If Philip Corso is correct about sharing alien technology with corporations, it's virtually guaranteed that includes weather control!

  
These claims aren't based on fringe conspiracy theories; they're based on speeches given to Congress about annual reports on weather modification, and the reports themselves, which admit to some early degree of success in some of the experiments.

There have been scientific reports by government scientists, legislation and law suits on the subject.  
Then disclosure came to a halt, and most of it's being done in secret. This began at about the same time that the Roswell crash help begin Corso's alleged technology sharing efforts. There's strong circumstantial evidence that this might be related to alien technology, including the largest UFO sighting in history at Fatima in 1917.

There are non-positive races that are hidden in various caves and in Inner Earth environments, alongside negative factions. It is an Orion Star System spacecraft with three crew members. The Earth Protection Grid that is activated by the Forces of Light prevents any escape now. No one of the negative forces leaves the planet, fleeing, no matter how hard they try. It is a measure for all negative forces to be captured. The ship was shot down by the protective magnetic field after several warnings from the Ashtar Command not to attempt an escape. It was not hit by the Brazilian army/aeronautics or any country abroad such as the USA. It was manned by reptilians of the negative faction. The ship suffered a breakdown and was trying to return to the starting point when it crashed.

And the most interesting part is that he had lifelong scaring in his lungs from a disease in childhood that was proven to be cleared after this.

aliens,"Greetings fellow Earthlings,

My intentions in telling this subreddit my story isn't to convince anyone of anything; I myself am chronically skeptical, and encourage everyone else to hone an attitude of healthy and scientifically motivated skepticism themselves. 

That tidbit aside here is my best recollection of the events of last night: 

(April 5th, around 10:30pm)

I decided to experiment to see whether the stories regarding CE5 were bullshit or real. For those of you that don't know; CE5 is basically the act of meditating with the goal of making extraterrestrial contact. There is plenty of information on the subject; both in book form, documentary, and online article.

Anyway, on with the story...

I live up north in B.C. Canada; I'm fortunate enough to be located in an area with almost no light pollution. 

That night held constellations that were crystal clear, easy to see; it wasn't a full-moon, yet there wasn't a visible cloud to be seen. To me, the conditions for a CE5 session could not have been better. 

I sat in my backyard, in front of a campfire, seated comfortably on a reclining lawn chair. At this point I wasn't expecting any results so I hadn't brought my phone with me which was charging inside the house.

I lit a cigarette, took a deep breath, and stared at the sky for an unknown period of time; just thinking and readying myself. Once I was in the frame of mind to carry on with my experiment, I closed my eyes and began to repeat the following mantra in my head:

""I am a skeptic; however aliens are a possibility more likely than not. If I am worthy, please show me a sign. I come humbly, seeking answers to the question of whether aliens are real or not."" 

I didn't even meditate that long; maybe five minutes at most. After that, I opened my eyes.

👽Among the sea of stars above there was a sudden flash, blue-yellowish light; the best way I could describe it is like a giant cosmic camera taking a picture of me with the flash on. This quick explosion of light brought my attention to the tiny star-like object that had created the phenomenon. 
A spec of light, smaller than most of the stars around it; it was moving swiftly, making bizarre maneuvers that immediately let me know that it wasn't a plane or satellite. Even after that flash I was still doubting my senses; but in hindsight nothing man-made could have done any of the things that I witnessed.

After the first flash, my heart beating like a drum, I ran inside; at this point I was questioning my sanity. I took a shower, ate some pizza pockets, made a pot of coffee.

(I also texted my uncle to tell him what had happened, he was definitely jealous)

Before I had stepped into the shower I threw my GoPro Hero 8 on it's charger, along with my headlamp flashlight, and phone. I was intending to go back outside and see if I couldn't capture these paranormal happenings in 4K.

So with my powerful LED flashlight around my neck, my GoPro in night photography mode, and a thermos of coffee; I made my way back outside with the hope that the light from above would return.

The clock was approaching midnight; before sitting in my chair I rekindled the fire.

I pointed my camera skyward...

""GoPro capture.""..................*beep, beep*

""GoPro capture.""..................*beep, beep*

I continued to take pictures of the sky; unfortunately I wasn't able to capture anything significant; a ton of beautiful star pictures though. When I took a video the camera's capabilities were not good enough to get anything but pitch darkness; so I had no choice but to rely on individual photographs with an annoying capture delay.

Eventually my GoPro was running low on juice. I powered it off; and that was when the lights made their return...go figure🙄.

There were a few flashes from different points in the sky; these seemed to be in response to me beaming my light at the sky.

I also saw what I've dubbed ""stealth observers"". 

👽The observer appeared as a star, slightly brighter than the rest. It would sit stationary for 20 or so minutes at a time; drawing zero attention to itself. It would then slowly move to a different location in the sky, and remain stationary for another 20 minutes; and so the cycle would repeat.

At around 1am I was too tired to stay out there; the fire had died down and I was getting cold.

""Goodnight my friends."" I spoke to the sky, while making the 🖖 gesture.

I went inside and crawled into bed, my head still reeling from the night's events. I promptly fell asleep. 

~

Now that I've had some time to mull this over I know for a fact that I wasn't hallucinating or imagining this. I was 100% sober, well-rested, and lucid. The only explanation I can come up with is that there is more to CE5 than I originally thought. I guess I have no choice but to believe in aliens now. I can't wait to try CE5 again; hopefully I can get something on camera.

I hope that my story has been worth the read and interesting. Don't take my word for anything, do your own research, and try CE5 for yourself.

Cheers Sincerely, Cythil",I believe now🤯👽My experience with CE5🧘‍♂️

Its best for everyone if we can find reasonable explanations to some of the cases because it removes time consumed from everyone else not focusing on the wrong cases.

all this said you can make up your own mind about the Kecksburg case after this post.

This research was originally done by John Ventre and Owen Eichler so im not personally taking any credit from it.

&amp;#x200B;

December 9, 1965 at 4:47 pm, something navigated through airspace and made a semi controlled crashing in Kecksburg Pennsylvania.

The following explanation would explain the military presence and silencing of witnesses.  
Re-entry vehicles were fairly new concept and designs were highly classified

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/r0mbwrx0lkr61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55577303be6d5971cbb79786e7b4593409706a1)

General Electric Mark 2 re-entry vehicle 

During the late 1950s, many reentry vehicles were designed and flown by the United States and the USSR for the original goal of delivery of nuclear bombs, so they were top-secret to the highest levels.

&amp;#x200B;

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/zl1t7xkulkr61.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e407d772dbd3526c47669f4dc80da6c2bd976306)

American design used an internal moveable weighted control system for maneuvering in dense atmosphere closer to earth enabling the reentry vehicle to climb, descend and make turns.

This was a cold war project based on the A4 German rocket, commonly known as the V2, designed by Werner Von Braun. The MK2 was the first reentry vehicle to be used to carry an atomic warhead carrying up to 1.5 megatons of TNT equivalent at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Witness Jerry Betters sketch of the object on a flatbed truck matches the MK2.](https://preview.redd.it/ha1h0pp3mkr61.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0572d33630463f2e861fa3a63c498998b4c28e)

&amp;#x200B;

  Like i said before the military would be rushing the site to recover the vehicle. 

What confuses me is why were they in ""in moon suits"" and some witnesses were chased out of woods and told area may be radioactive. Maybe this was not a dummy warhead but the real thing? if thats the case it would probably be classified to this day.

Here are some important witness comments:

1. Randy Overly- it glowed green

2. Bob Gatty- site may be radioactive.

3. John Hays- chased out of woods and told area may be radioactive.

4. Bill Weaver- 4 guys in moon suits carried a 4x4 box into the woods.

5. Ernie Hoffman- it was the size of 2 suitcases on the flatbed.

6. John Mays- 20-25 military on site; blue lights in woods.

7. Robert Blystone- Military was all over site.

8. Larry Snyder- Armed military barred access. 

9. Lillian Hays- Military and civilian personnel used her house and phone. No calls

registered on bill.

10. John Hays- Air Force and NASA at their home saw NASA patches on clothing.

11. Bill Bulebush- It made a turn. Saw Egyptian markings.

12. James Romanski- Saw Egyptian markings that looked like they were welded on.

13. Jerry Betters- drew the only notarized sketch of object on flatbed and it 100% matches

the GE Mark 4.

Just want to clarify that everything mentioned below is pure good ol' fun speculation, please do not take anything too seriously, this is nothing culty, please don't make any dumb decisions based on a reddit prediction!  some of this is stuff i mentioned in a [previous post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/m9pgzo/i_think_i_figured_out_why_july_18_is_a/) so you can skip to the TLDR if you want.

My whole idea hinges on a thread of comments made by a redditor named u/Throawaylien 7 years ago in an r/askreddit post about alien abductions. In these comments they stated that extraterrestrials would be Arriving (revealing themselves) on either July 8th or 18th of 2021.  If you haven't read their comment thread I highly recommend you check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r034d/alien_abductees_of_reddit_or_people_who_have/cdikpd2/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) (make sure you read alll of their comment replies to get the full picture).

For some reason I just completely believe this person's abduction story.  He mentions the aliens showed him footage of all kinds of things including the construction of the Great Pyramids by humans.They even describe how the Egyptians brought the stones inside and raised them from within, which lines up with the obscure [""internal ramp"" pyramid construction hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Houdin) most people don't even know about.

Along with throawaylien's  casual statements connecting the aliens to Ancient Egypt, there are a tons of other theories about Ancient Egyptians, their precursor cultures, and aliens.  The big example that comes to my head is the testimony from multiple credible people from Roswell who stated they [saw hieroglyphic symbols](https://youtu.be/YadmGZcvgr8?t=487) similar to Ancient Egyptian on supposed debris from the craft.  Roswell also happened around July 8, 1947 (!!).  The whole Ancient Egyptian connection to Aliens is another massive rabbit hole in itself.  I recommend watching the documentary [Magical Egypt](http://www.magicalegypt.com/) or [Mystery of the Sphinx](https://www.gaia.com/video/mystery-sphinx) by archaeologist John Anthony West to learn more about that!

Going back to throawaylien's statements, I was hung up on the specificity of the date, July 8 or 18.  They had also mentioned there might be some kind of celestial alignment that allows the aliens to travel here quickly during that time.  I checked to see what kinds of astrological events were happening on those dates and drew a blank everywhere until I had randomly stumbled on the wikipedia page for [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), the brightest star in the sky, and probably the most important star for the Ancient Egyptians.

I made an entire post about the connection between Sirius, the Egyptians and throawaylien's July 18 prediction you can read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/m9pgzo/i_think_i_figured_out_why_july_18_is_a/)

Basically the heliacal rising of the star Sirius occurs on the Giza Plateau right on July 19.  The heliacal rising of Sirius is the moment when the star rises in the morning sky right before the sun.  The absolutely crazy thing is that the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs exactly every 365.25 days, *perfectly* relative to our solar year.  The Ancient Egyptians [worshipped Sirius like a goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet) (described as a triangle), and based their entire [calendrical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_calendar#Prehistory) on its heliacal rising (starting even before the Old Kingdom period). The heliacal rising also traditionally signaled the beginning of the Nile flood season the Egyptians survived on.

This date is very important to Ancient Egyptian cosmology, and also got me thinking about something else throawaylien was confused about regarding the origins of the aliens:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Their planet is, so they told me anyway, a very long way away. They couldn't explain to me how far, they said, becuase it was too far for me to understand and it was also **""close to the side"".** I have no idea what that meant, but it's always stuck with me. Home is ""Too far away for you to understand, but also close to the side.""

The line ""close to the side"" was weird to me as well, like wtf does mean and why would this person make something like that up? It would be too random. I was reading more about the Sirius binary star system and came across another fascinating clue, the Gaia 1 star cluster.

[The Gaia 1 star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_1) is a MASSIVE cluster of about 1200 stars located extremely close to Sirius, that all originated from the same molecular cloud around the same time roughly 6.3 billion years ago.  They are all bound by a mutual gravitational attraction that constantly gets shifted by the pull from the center of the Milky Way.  Astronomers only JUST discovered this star cluster in 2017 because it is located so close to the Sirius system that the brightness of the star obstructs our view of the massive Gaia 1 star cluster sitting RIGHT behind it.

continued/TLDR:

**I believe the aliens we will come in contact with on July 18 originate from a planet located within the Gaia 1 star cluster that is also ""close to the side"" where the Sirius system and Earth are located.  I personally think the Sirius star is an important galactic marker for extraterrestrials within the cluster, and they will use July 19th's heliacal rising of Sirius in Egypt for some kind of navigational path, and/or for a symbolic date that lines up with the beginning of the Ancient Egyptian calendrical system centered around Sirius.**","I think I figured out why July 18 is a significant Arrival date according to throawaylien, PART 2: ""Close to the Side"""

aliens,"Some people claim that some of them walk amongst us disguised as humans. The late remote viewer Ingo Sawnn, in his book “Penetration” claimed he encountered an extremely attractive woman in an LA supermarket who he knew instinctively was  an alien. 

He also claimed his suspicions were confirmed when he noticed intelligence operatives (that he had previously met during a significant UFO event), actually surveilling her at the time..he went on to state that a friend of his was waiting in a car and when Ingo went to the car he asked the friend to wait until the woman left the supermarket to get his opinion of this beautiful woman. 

Without any prompting his friend allegedly knew that she was an alien and thought it was nothing unusual for LA, as there were loads of aliens living there..

I have no idea if Ingo was just making things up or not but it’s an interesting story al the same. It would also make sense to me that if aliens are living as humans they would live where the money and fame is. Meaning earth could very well be a playground for them. It would explain a lot about our inhumane eCONomic system IMO.

The other person who claimed to have encountered one and possibly two “shape shifters” is Billy Corgan from smashing Pumpkins.. He has been extremely vague on whatever he encountered however, so I only know that he says he wasn’t on drugs and that he saw a naked person change and that the person acknowledged that it happened..and that’s all Billy will say on the matter publicly. He won’t say what the person change into or who the person was..

The other incident is one that I have not heard him discuss but other people claim he has spoken about seeing a record executive do the same thing with added sinister information concerning humans being here to suffer..again I have not found any evidence where he has stated  this..however if anyone can find reliable info please post it.

So the suspicion about aliens being here disguised as humans sounds very much like the move They Live. In other words aliens in high positions or simply living the high life..frankly it would not surprise me one bit.",Who here has met an alien?

Very few of those in the habitable zone have atmosphere's but when you have 100's of billions of planets you literally have a very good chance of having life in a galaxy..... now wait hang in there. Everyone thinks that aliens are always gonna be more advanced than us on earth and since i know for a fact there is life out there in the universe other than us in some form. Now lemme tell you back in the days of the cavemen when aircraft should not have even been in their minds archaeologist have found paintings of what look like beings with slender heads in what looks like modern day space suits. There should be no way possible they should know that a space suit looks like that. (you can look it up) Also another thing is we often depict aliens as barbarians here to take over planet earth... when in reality we are going off of past human behavior and what we would do. We do not know what these aliens will do when they finally come down to earth we have no way of judging them and their intentions. If you ask me we are just like a gorilla confined to its in closure. we have no concept of the universe we are just like an animal. They have no concept of the world. we only know the basic's from our telescopes. Now let me tell u something on why we should not blame the government if they are hiding the fact aliens exist, because there are retards out there who the second they got there hands on a space ship or something they would F\*ck up and do something like ram into earth at the speed of light. BAM extinct. Just think about what terroist would do with this techology. Alien life forms like this are already past destruction or else we would have been killed years ago or they would have wiped themselves off the face of the earth.

Also let me put it like this imagine if you took a F-22( fighter jet) and flew it back in the early 1900's they would be astonished. we would breeze right by the wright brothers early gliders. They would be just like primitive technology. They had no comprehension of most chemical reactions and stuff we have today. In due time humanity will have the same or similar tech as ETs. Remember anything is possible with the right science. Now as well when you think of a tiger an scientist hoping to observe it what do they do? They tranquilize it. And study its body. Just as some abductees have said( some were lying) And just like a tiger do you try to teach it stuff? no you let it go cause you have more species to study...AHH u caught that didn't you. MORE SPECIES maybe these Advanced alien species are studying other primitive alien species like us. And they cant help us all and wait for us to instead evolve ourselves naturally. Then make contact when we are not still crazy and attacking each other and everything. Everyone is sooo scared of aliens because of the way Hollywood portray's them.

Also we have just started studying space LOL. We are ignorant and not willing to stop and think about other things and maybe think some stuff is possible ( here's an example ) 100's of years ago we thought the earth was flat now its common knowledge the earth is round. Maybe a hundred years from now aliens existing will be common knowledge and well be living with them. And maybe off in some distant galaxy some other alien is typing on their version of Reddit talking about the possibilities of life out there.. ;) Otherwise let me ask u this if life is soooo impossible why are we here?",PLZ read this u wont regret

aliens,,Nitinol memory metal. Back Engineered ET Tech from Roswell?
aliens,"We didn't evolve from apes, we evolved from REPTILES. Dinosaurs, to be specific. Dinosaur DNA was modified by a race of beings that came to this planet for the explicit purposes of genetic engineering. 

Existing dinosaurs were modified to become apes, which then were modified even further over long periods to become us. At some point, there was a split, and the dinosaurs that became us went one evolutionary direction, and another group went along a similar path... And evolved to become what are referred to as **Reptilians**.

Reptilians are real, and they are STILL here on Earth, living underground, and some have adapted to live under our oceans. Their technology is exponentially more advanced, and vast majority of the UFO's witnessed throughout history have been them, not visitors from outside our planet. 

Furthermore, there are countless other creatures on this planet that are the direct result of engineering by the beings that came here long ago. Most of them are deep under the oceans. Think of Earth like a petri dish, and they were the scientists, introducing various experiments into planet Earth's ecosystem. 

Some of the creatures we are accustomed to, like squid, octopuses, and various other biologically unique lifeforms are in the very literal sense, aliens as well. As in, they literally were imported here from another planet. 

Finally, the Reptilians that currently occupy this planet with us, evolved from a species of dinosaurs called (Troodon)[https://ibb.co/JcqtrsP]. They branched off from our common ancestor, and became bipedal humanoids. 

The human genome is so complex, that there is no statiscal proposition in which it could happen by accident. We are the product of direct design, only our God, is a ""they"", not ""he"".","Reptilians are real, and we share a common ancestor with them."

""This one is the most eventful by far.  
 Before I started I stated my intentions, they were: fulfillment, peace, clarity and understanding, I started meditating and went into a fairly deep state of concentration, but the meditation seemed really long, even thought it was only 20 minutes. After I finished meditating I projected my intentions to whoever was there and became very emotional because I really wanted to be guided and know that I am not alone in this universe, I went to the window and started scanning the night sky for about 5 minutes and then I saw something blink in the middle to right side of my field of view (or visible portion of the sky from my window), It was like a star blinked so I immediately looked at it and started focusing on that area, I waited for about 30 seconds and then it blinked again. At this point my heart started pounding very fast at the thought that I, a mere human, made a freaking UFO come above me to single its presence, I was like “holy shit” for pretty much the whole thing and when the third blink happened I was convinced that this object wasn’t a plane or comet because it was stationary, it didn’t move an inch every time it blinked, my fear subsided and I looked again and then it blinked a fourth and final time. I stayed my head glued to the stars trying to see if the object is going to blink again but it didn’t, it just disappeared.""

aliens,"This may or may not be an UFO, but thought you guys might have an explanation for this.

I was admiring the night's sky when I saw a red light flashing. It was pale, almost like every other star so I didnt notice it right away. At first it was still, so I thought is just a red star or something. 

Then it started moving. At first pretty slow, then it got a decent speed and it passed above me. I could not distinguish any exact shape, but it certainly looked like an object was there.

It passed over me then out of my vision. I couldnt take a picture, but hopefully my description is decent enough to get an answer. Also there was no trail behind it, so I dont think it was a commet or such. 

Its my first time seeing anything like it, and I admire the night sky regularly. This happened minutes ago btw.

Any ideas? I dont want to jump to conclusions, thats why I asked here. Hopefully its the right place.",Red light moving in the night.

I've taken the original video, slowed it down to 0.5x, and tried to make the second object more visible.

Of course we don't know what the second object moving into the frame above the original UAP is. However, take note. The original object accelerates as the second object comes into frame above it, it appears* to tail the primary object for a brief moment.

__________________________________________

Notes: I am not a professional video editor, by any means. Someone can do a better job, I am sure.

I suspect the second object may be a bird, but what I find most interesting is the *potential interaction between these two objects.

aliens,"So this dream happened to me when I was about 13 years old. I awoke in my dream to a bright light all around me, inside my bedroom. I had panic alarms going off in my head. Like serious dread, Ive never experienced this kind of sheer terror before (and to this day Im 40 now) I ran to my parents bedroom, as I was going down the hall to their bedroom I could see flashed of light coming from under and around the door from inside their room. I busted through the doors and they were both there dead asleep. I started screaming at them as loud as my little lungs could do. They didnt flinch, no response at all. Before I could run to them to shake them, I felt something watching me, I looked over to the sliding glass doors leading to the outside. I saw two I guess what you call grey aliens, short big eyed and grey. Thats were it ends I woke up in the morning fine in my bed. Honest though Ive never felt terror, dread, just every part of your body telling you to run, and you have no idea why. Do I think I was abducted? No, just a crazy dream. I just thought Id share it.",An alien dream I had.
aliens,"I was staying at my grandma's house for the summer. When a power outage happened. Mom gave each of us a flashlight for the night. I remember lying on my back on the porch bed, watching the sky, and playing with my lamp, when I noticed a particularly large star. 

I decided to point the beam at it for some reason. Just then, It instantly vanished. Leaving a large void where it used to be. I panicked ( was around 4 or 6 years old) woke up my older cousin to tell her about it.

She patiently explained to me-- clearly annoyed.That stars don't get hurt by light and it's impossible for my beam to reach it--being lightyears away and all. But I was certain that I saw it disappear. She got more annoyed then rolled over to face the other side of the bed.

I tried to go back to sleep, but I still felt worried about it. She wasn't wrong about other things, but I was absolutely certain a star was in that exact spot. I Fell asleep. The next day I lost track of where that void was so I thought I imagined it. Of course I can never be certain enough so there is a good chance it was nothing. 

However, I wanted to share this for the sake of the fandom. Reading declassified documents on this phenomena became one of my quarantine pastimes. Amongst those reports I found that star-like UAPs are the most commonly reported. Who knows it might've been one of those things","I found an explanation, for a strange and almost forgotten memory"

He does seem to have a lot of indepth knowledge of certain things, right?

Is it possible he did in fcat work on black triangles/TR-3B (or whatever they are called), however, maybe in the time since, he has added a lot of bullshit onto his claims, in an attempt to stay relevant and soak up as much fame as possible within UFO circles, only for it to have all come back and bit him in the ass?

Or has everything the guy has ever said been total bullshit from the very beginning?

aliens,"So in the Bible it states that satan was and his angels where thrown into the outer-space aka 2nd heaven realm to dwell, so as. Christian I wouldn’t doubt aliens just being demons, I mean it’s not that far-fetched. There where claims where(I’ve experienced this) where “alien abduction” happened and the victim called out in Jesus’ name causing the “alien abduction” to no longer take place. Just a few weeks ago i had a supernatural experience with an alien; where I was in a state of paralysis but I could still mostly move, I pulled up my bed sheets and saw a generic looking alien with dark clothes on. I immediately called out to God and said “In Jesus name I cast out this abomination in front of me” and I was still sorta paralyzed but the “alien” was no longer present. These event took place about of month after I was born again through Christ, and a few days after I went on the deep web and tried to find videos of aliens. Really to be honest I wasn’t really surprised and wasn’t much intrigued or even scared. Because before that my eyes where opened to the demonic and satanic forces going on around us and in this world.

aliens,"Took place in Victoria, Australia a fair ways out of Melbourne in the bush I'd have to ask her for the year this happened again as ive got not a clue, but im assuming early 50's (can get more info if anyone finds this interesting) but she claims driving with all of her sisters in the car driving home from seeing family down a very dark road, they had a very bright glow coming from the sky which lastest a few seconds before what they thought looked like a very long train of a monorail dip from the sky insanely fast come done to earth and loop straight back into the sky as quickly as it came down.

The family members who were in the car had always claimed to had seen the same thing with 0 explanation as to what it couldve been, my grandma who is still around can still remember it as clear as day and swears it was something otherwordly by the way it moved and the glow/lights that emited from it was like nothing that was around back then.


I remember hearing about it when i was fairly young i had heaps of books about Aliens and UFO's and stuff and i was showing them to my Grandma and she told me this story which as i got older assumed she was just trying to be fun and tell me a story to excite her Grandson, but a couple weeks ago with my family the story came up again and kinda shocked me that they swear by it.

anyways may or may not be interesting, i am a firm beliver and enjoy reading stories and thought someone may enjoy this, if anyone has any questions id be happy to ask her next time i get a chance.

aliens,"Betty and Barney Hill were the first. 1961. Seems strange to me that throughout the whole of history this is considered the first abduction story. If anything it makes me less likely to believe in abductions, because it was only during the 20th century that aliens became mainstream in pop culture, lining the first abduction story right up in that period of public interest. What do you guys think?",Why are there no accounts of alien abduction before 1961?
aliens,"This is something I wanted to share for a long time, I'd like your opinion on what I'm about to share.

I must have been around the age of 11 and 13 at the time probably about to become a Highschool freshman,  I was hanging out with my child hood best friend (Sam) who'd live a couple of houses away from mine, it was just a regular afternoon in the island of Aruba probably 5 or 6 since there was still some decent amount of day light, we'd often climb on his roof and just look at the clouds and probably talk about how nevrous we were for highschool, anyways I swear as I was looking up into the clouds I saw what I can only describe as an outline of a some kind of aircraft, like you know how in the movies you see a ship go invisible and only have some kind outline, it was something of that sort, I remember it being massive, I proceeded to make eye contact with Sam to verify that I just wasn't seeing things, for some reason I got rushed with the uneasy feeling of anxiety, or that feeling you get when you did something wrong and you're about to get punished, I don't know why I felt that way, but we proceed to get back down and go into his house.


I don't remember much after that, but it's really something that pops into my head even now as a 24 year old, I moved to the United States to further my education, and lost contact with Sam due to well just taking different paths I guess, I know after highschool he just became a Waiter and is still a waiter to this day, but I wonder if he thinks about that day or If he even remembers it as clearly as I do, I kinda want to to talk to him about it but I feel like we may just dismiss it as us kids having hyperactive imaginations at the time.",Something I can't get out of mind after a decade

aliens,"I was out camping in the words of the white mountains of New Hampshire when we were stargazing out in the middle of a river on a large granite rock face that was exposed enough to easily fit all four of us laying around. We were just admiring the Milky Way and all of the satellites flying by. We would call out each satellite to watch as it would pass by and maybe twinkle or just pass out of sight. When this particular light went by we called it out because it was slowing down and that’s when it became brighter. I personally watched it swing in towards us and seem to come down from orbit to about the height of 500 feet away from us. The light flashed down on us with what looked like a triangle of four HD lights on each of the three sides. There were no lights at the corners, just the sides. Then just as fast as it looked down at us, it flicked back up and disappeared into the stars. 

This is what I witnessed personally. We went back to camp to warm up by the fire and we were all laying around. I do take my to female huskies camping. They have great ears and I trust them to watch over the camp at night while we watch the fire. While we were sitting by the fire my father saw a faint glowing leg and hip, disappear behind a tree. He waited to see if it would reappear but nothing. My cousin who was sitting on the same side said he saw a similar thing go the opposite way but closer. 

I was on the side with my back to these sightings but all I heard was rustling in the woods behind me. I assumed aliens cause I was busy thinking about the flyover of lights. I mentioned the sounds I was hearing in the woods but dismissed it as woodland creatures. It wasnt until the next morning they mentioned what they saw. 

We discussed it deeply and wondered why the dogs hadn’t reacted to them even though they had been spotted not even 5 yards away. Maybe they were down wind? Maybe the lady huskies were tired from a day of camping? Has anyone had any incidents with aliens and dogs?",Can dogs sense aliens?

I guess I kinda lost my way and stopped expressing myself for a long time. Then I was in a wreck hit my head and probably destroyed the “God” gene or whatever in my brain (because everyone is born with it). I don’t miss it. There is far to much dogma in the world anyways.

That’s ok. I don’t care now. It’s whatever. I just now have put together a lot of pieces to this thing we call “existence”.

Here’s my thought (if someone else has already said it, awesome- but I didn’t hear it anywhere else, I guess great minds think alike!) the world is probably a jail or a nursery. 
On the jail:
No wonder we are alone. Aliens don’t wanna interact with the worst individuals. So they convict aliens and when they receive a severe punishment they get “born” (the soul) In a third world country. Where they would really have to suffer. Probably where there really isn’t any hope to change.
Or it’s a nursery: if they can create life why not just find a way for someone else to raise them into what they want us to become. They can choose the caretakers (parents) to watch over the soul the alien parents created. It makes sense because as we get older we don’t really wanna interact with a younger generation (unless to procreate).

Oh and I’m not someone telling you that i know everything or that people need to take my thoughts as 100% truth to your life. You can cherry pick the ideas you like and throw away the ones you don’t like. There probably will be massive holes here, I never said it was perfect. 

I don’t know.",I grew up extremely faithful...
aliens,"So I'll make the introduction brief, yes I believe in aliens/other life forms. Ever since I was a kid. I've seen three different types of UFOs, each time with someone else whether it was with my friend (7 straight lights on the highway), or with my dad (silent fireball in the sky crossing the horizon). I also saw an X shaped UFO but this was years ago.

I tend to read up on other subreddits such as r/UFOs but I just discovered this one and wanted to share an experience that I had since it seems more appropriate here.

One night last year, I was trying to sleep. I typically have the TV still on with my bed covers over my head. It's a habit I had since I was a kid but I now sleep normally. Anyway, I can still see the TV light as I laid there but then at some point something was standing in front of my TV. I know it was some body that was just there. I had the covers over me so I could just make out the shape. I didn't move, but it wasn't really my nerves telling me not to move. I felt like I just couldn't, or I shouldn't. It was this weird feeling in general. Before anyone brings up the sleep paralysis theory, it gets worse.

I hear this constant whining in my ears. It's this pulsing whining sound that actually got to a point where my ears started to feel pain. Then everything stopped. Nothing. Back to normal, nothing standing there. No more pain. Now I understand that sleep paralysis can cause pain of sorts....but my ears kept ringing for about a month. Very slight but always there. My eyesight got progressively worse, I can still use my current glasses but my eyesight itself is much worse. My hearing has improved to a point where I can easily tell the difference between 44100 frequency and 48000 frequency which I tested with a friend. 

Other small things affected me but nothing noteworthy. This hasn't happened again and I pray that it doesn't. I feel super odd typing this out and I'll probably seem like a lunatic. I've only told this story to about 3 people and they didn't offer much in a response. I'm not really writing this all for a response, I just wanted to get it out there so I don't have to keep this in my head forever.

Thanks.",I wanted to share my experience if that's alright.

But I’m a very realistic person, I believe when you die it’s the same as before life. If things can’t be proved I never believe them. But one time driving home on a road I drive home very often on, a popular city in south Florida (Weston) I came to a redlight around 2/3 am and I noticed an over powering-ly BRIGHT ball that I had never noticed maybe 100/200 yards in front of me. Me taking this road very often the light immediately seemed out of place, and for some reason I just stayed at a stop to stare in confusion. It was so bright, i was unable to focus on its exact details. But as I began to stare longer, it didn’t seem to change shape or size or altitude at all, but some how some way. It just disappeared off into the distance, but for some reason it never seemed to change any size what so ever, then within .5 of a second it seemed like it was as far as a star. And I know this is nothing exotic or wild, but to this day I cannot describe it in words and it’s always bothered me. I have never been able to comprehend what it was in any way. Just wondering if maybe someone has seen this before? It just was there in full, and then within a split second absolutely gone. And I was completely looking at it 100% of the time as I have never seen anything like this before. I mean I am giving a rough estimate of the distance between me and the object, but I just like was not able to focus on it from its brightness, then and I’m completely locked on this object, it seamlessly disappears while I’m locked on this thing. And I was unable to even see how it just disappeared ? It seemed like it was full size, until it was just absolutely gone?","Any one else? Idk. Not one to believe, but I can’t explain."

We can see at the end of the movie, when the observer changes the direction of filming that object towards him, you can clearly see that West cardinal point was in the left of the initial observation. Most likely he was filming in the East at the end.

Although on the YT clip we see that the hour is 21:45, we can also see that ISS was passing by at 21:24.

Also the movement of the object is a straight line, **despite the movement of the observer (sometimes sideway) and his camera**. Those recorded movements are explained due to parallax effect.

ISS was passing by from 21:21 (from W) until 21:29 (to E).

Are they interdimensional energetic beings taking on the form of a craft as to arouse less hysteria?

Can they travel anywhere in the universe, and have a presence everywhere?

What are the chances that another alien species on a different planet is experiencing the same type of encounters with UFOs?

If so, how many planetary projects do they have going on right now? Were we genetically engineered by them? Were the parameters of our planet and galaxy attuned by them to allow life to flourish?

What would make them fixate on us? Is life really that rare, or are they invested in our progress? What do they gain by having planetary projects? Is it just for fun, or fuel?

aliens,,This is why we cant see any UFO's CIA
aliens,"""I had the impression that this object could foresee what I was thinking. This is an experience that has changed me for the rest of my life,” says Captain Jorge Polanco, one of the witnesses in the 1955 Bariloche Incident.

If UFOs already possess the technology to dwarf the jets of the U.S. Navy, they most likely have the data on recent man-made technologies like the internet and smartphones. Now, with smartphones, internet, and surveillance cameras everywhere, even one very clear video of an alien encounter and UFO landing would equate to official contact. To put it simply, we lack close-up footage of UFOs because that is not what they want us to see. 

Thus, assuming that these aliens may be choosing not to contact us for now, one might wonder why they chose to appear before some children in rural areas in the past. A logical guess as to why these aliens might have appeared to children but not to professionals with credentials might have to do with Earth’s own internal level of development. Specifically, if such alien encounters were to happen to a notable person, it would disrupt the person’s original “intended” course of life. Specifically, they might have become ufologists instead of achieving feats in their relevant field as an aftermath of a life-changing experience. All things considered, if aliens are making any contact with us, they want to minimize their impact on humanity while gradually helping us realize that we are not alone. 

Nevertheless, in recent years, UFOs appeared in front of U.S. Navy pilots to the point where the Navy and Pentagon were officially forced to acknowledge their existence. The United States had effectively denied the existence of UFOs until now. Its sudden change in stance has rendered government agencies questionable and suspicious in the eyes of the general public. To me, it seems these UFOs are aware of humanity’s censorship of alien life, and they are not “comfortable” with the elites or media corporations currently governing mankind.

Due to recent political and media polarization, the American public is more divided than ever. These UFOs will appear more frequently as the mainstream media becomes even less trustworthy and the mainstream scientific community fails to explain them. Specifically, the aliens themselves will appear when society’s cynicism toward human nature is at its peak. For this reason, I suspect something worse than the recent COVID-19 outbreak is awaiting humanity.",Why can we not see aliens?

Humans wield consciousness, the most powerful force we've ever discovered, in a reckless way. And we WILL suffer the consequences.

What if the human body is nothing more than a host for an alien lifeform and we dont know it??? 

All throughout History and religion it is claimed we all have souls... What if those souls are really an energy alien being??? They claim that spirits are pure energy... So what if what we think as a spirit is nothing more than an energy entity???

There is a rare condition that make me wonder about this called Alien Hand Syndrome...

Alien Hand Syndrome is where the 2 halves of the brain that is connected to each other the thin tissue that connects them gets a tear in it... It severs the link between both sides of the brain causing 1 hand to act on its own while the person in control has no control over that hand and it does whatever it wants... Almost as if you are actually 2 different people...

Now what if the alien energy being is just using the human body as a host to prolong it life and is dormant not interacting with the host as a way to recharge or just observe and if the brain get a tear in it causes it to no longer be able to hide and it acts out on its own thus cause what is known to be Alien Hand Syndrome???

One thing that crosses my mind often with all this UFO stuff. If they were capable of coming here, is it a stretch that they’d fully understand us? Would they know our social limitations? Understand the threshold for what we take seriously without ridiculing each other? Could they even control the evidence to a level where we sound crazy to each other if we even believe in them?

I personally picture a button on their saucer that says “scan for human photography”. They run it through their database, check the photographer against Facebook, and see what damage it would do.

aliens,"There are a lot of strong feelings about the Serpo exchange story and the contents of [serpo.org](http://serpo.org/index.php) (which is back online if anyone wanted to start downloading the files in case it disappears again). For me, the details on the site and in the story remain interesting to say the least, but, like most everything else in the subject matter, it remains unsubstantiated and is relegated to being little more than a cool story that may or may not be real. At any rate, as I watched CE3K for the dozenth time today, it occurred to me that, if the movie did, in fact, touch on the truth, then there may be something else to corroborate the story in part. Unlike the movie, I found no mass evacuations or anything that matched the section of the movie preceding the arrival of the visitors. There is one thing, however, that stood out. Before I go further, nothing here is meant to make the conclusion that it really happened, but is meant to stimulate conversation or extra thought; this was just a connection I didn't make until today. 

According to the exchange story, the landings occurred on April 24, 1964 near Holloman AFB just west of Alamogordo, NM. Going deeper reveals claims that the event actually took place in the vicinity of the White Sands Missile Range/Space Harbor region, which is farther west from Holloman. From page 41 of [a release](http://www.serpo.org/Serpo_releases_with_commentary.pdf) on the event at serpo.org:

&gt;*The first Eben craft entered our atmosphere during the afternoon of April 24,
1964.* **the Eben craft landed at the wrong location, near Socorro, New Mexico.**
*Our team was in place at White Sands. We were able to communicate a
message to the Eben craft that they landed at the wrong location. The second
Eben craft picked up the message and landed at the correct location.*

&gt;*MEETING: The Eben craft landed exactly at the location we sent. There were
16 senior U.S. Government officials on the ground. Some were political and
some were senior officials, including military officers. The Ebens exited their
craft and walked under a pre-located canopy. The Ebens gave gifts of their
technology. The Ebens had a crude translator device. It appeared to be some
sort of microphone with a read-out screen.*

On April 24, 1964, around 5:45 - 5:50 pm, police Sergeant, [Lonnie Zamora](https://www.socorronm.org/attractions/socorro-landing-a-ufo-story/), reportedly observed a shiny oval object with two figures next to it in the desert near Socorro, NM. This sighting is one of the most well-documented and researched sightings in the United States with investigations involving none other than J. Allen Hynek (Project Blue Book fame and consultant for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind). 

Anywho, at the very least, this is an interestingly timed sighting, but, at the very most, seems to match, at least a little, the timing of the event that was said to have occurred in the area of Holloman AFB.",Socorro sighting and the Serpo exchange story

# To The Stars Academy Theory

So here is a theory. ONLY A THEORY! PLEASE DON'T ATTACK ME. LOOK FOR YOURSELF. MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.

My Theory is that Harold Puthoff is the TTSA mastermind of the lie. I think Harry (or Hal) being an OG Scientologist was into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Harry summoned some sort of occult powers and used them in the CIA uncovering psychics with his self proclaimed ""remote viewing abilities"" (Go ahead and wiki him)

Look into the family history of TTSA board member Chris Mellon. Check the book ""bloodlines of the Illuminati"" [https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/FC/FC2F5371043C48FDD95AEDE7B8A49624\_Springmeier.-.Bloodlines.of.the.Illuminati.R.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/FC/FC2F5371043C48FDD95AEDE7B8A49624_Springmeier.-.Bloodlines.of.the.Illuminati.R.pdf)

Here it shows that The Reynolds family (Illuminati) worked with the Mellon family. Here is a great article that mentions Andrew Mellon a prominent Freemason who contributed to the Masonic architecture in Washington, D.C. [https://medium.com/@alexvilk6/the-house-of-mellon-part-iv-a-death-in-the-family-67cc281564c9](https://medium.com/@alexvilk6/the-house-of-mellon-part-iv-a-death-in-the-family-67cc281564c9)

I think this TTSA UFO thing is a front for the rise of the lie. I think Tom DeLonge is being used as a smiling face to spoonfeed the lie to the masses by covering it up by pretending all this phenomena is aliens. (And plus the devil is just way more fun with Blink 182.)

Freemasons originate from Order of the Golden Dawn just like Scientology does and the Illuminati. Google Angels and Airwaves symbol. Check out Tom reppin all that masonic shit like the patch on his jacket in the AVA video ""surrender"".

This isn't about aliens its about the Order of the Golden Dawn and to perpetuate the encompassing lie on the masses, that there is no god or that god and the devil, angels and demons and good and evil are the same which is the satan.

2 Corinthians 11:14, ""And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.""

Tom released a couple books based on this ""paranormal"" stuff.

The non-fictional book is handled by Peter Levenda and acts as a sort of run through the Human history of religions and tying them all together to show that the people that wrote the ancient and religious texts were all talking about the same phenomena from different angels. The second book MAN handles DNA and consciousness and how these two concepts came to be and speculates on the origins of both.

His book Unholy Alliance is a book on Occultism

# Bob Lazar Interview Transcript

**Question**: ""Bob, you said you read in the document room some rather strange references to human evolution and the aliens' role in human genetics. How did that come up, in what context? What was it you saw?"" 

**Lazar**: ""I hate to repeat this stuff. I say this every time I mention it, because I have no other proof it's true, other than the fact that I read it; and I always follow that up by saying, yes, everything I read about the propulsion system turned out to be fact. But it's really far-fetched, and even though I did work with alien technology on flying saucers, I still find it difficult to come to grips with the physical alien thing in itself. But as far as where that came from, yes, there was a book that was almost like a history of the development of the human race. It was written from a different point of view. I don't think that particular thing had a title to it. But that's where we were referred to as 'containers.' Any time the word 'human' came up, it was always replaced with the word 'containers.' Earth was referred to as Sol 3 instead of earth. It was a strangely written report."" 

**Question**: ""What do you think the word 'containers' referred to?"" 

**Lazar**: ""That referred to people. Now, containers of what, I don't know. You can speculate on that until you turn BLUE."" 

**Question**: ""This book you're referring to -- are you saying this book was of alien origin?"" 

**Lazar**: ""I'll tell you exactly how it looked. It was certainly odd, in that it was written from another point of view. It was like a history book of us, like someone had been looking at the earth and written a brief history of what had happened, and how everything living here looked, so on and so forth. If you remember the old Collier's encyclopedias, in the section on anatomy they had the clear pages that you could turn, and there's the circulatory system, the organs, and so forth. OK. This was one of the most fascinating things in the briefings, other than the information itself. As you turned the page -- it would be a picture of, for instance, an old adobe house -- and as you moved the page up, you'd see through the different levels of the house, almost like those little 3-D things you bend and see different views, but it was very smooth and clear, much higher resolution. I'd just never seen anything like that. I don't know if it actually exists anywhere, or if we're talking about something of alien origin, but as you turn the page, you can see the superstructure, and then down to the wood itself, then the foundation. There again, there were no references to people. Everything was 'containers.'"" 

**Question**: ""But it was clear from the context that the word container referred to people? [BL: Right.] What kinds of things did they say about the people? Did they talk about how people behave, what the historical development was?"" 

**Lazar**: ""What they were talking about was the desirability of containers, and that the containers were not damaged. Now, people speculate on containers. Are they talking about containers of souls, something bizarre like that; or is it the opposite? Is the container the soul, and it contains the body? That's too far out really for me to grasp, but they were talking about the preservation of the containers, and how unique they are. Extremely, extremely unique..."" 

**Question**: ""That life like ours was very difficult to find."" 

**Lazar**: ""Very difficult to find."" 





# Bob Lazar Part 2



&gt; Lazar told KLASTV's George Knapp that ""religion was created so we have some rules and regulations for the sole purpose of not damaging the containers""





------------------------------------------------------------------
# Nigel Kerner's books and interviews 

&gt; [Kerner] went on to delineate a fascinating concept, explaining that a 'soul' might be a derivational information field that comes out of a natural cadence that came into the Universe with the Big Bang. This field holds the power to maintain information in what he called a morphogenic electro-spatial field with an eternal scope of existence in whatever form circumstance allows. The soul is therefore an ancestrally contiguous and coherent mechanism for holding information. 




Essentially Kerner goes on to argue that since most aliens are likely manufactured/created rather than biologic beings, they are most interested in finding out how to use our entropy-proof souls to continue their existence:

&gt; They are, however, subject to wear-and-tear as indeed are all atomically derived entities through the second law of thermodynamics that drives them into greater and greater states of decay with time. A non-atomic property however, such as a ""soul,"" is immune to the second law. Thus, this property was their ultimate goal, their ""holy grail,"" so to speak ... They are trying to use us as a bridge into 'soul' writing their programs into us through genetic engineering and implantation so that through us they can tap into an eternal existence. 


------------------------------------------------------------------





#Abduction Testimonies 


Whitley Streibler and John Mack, both credible UFO researchers (Mack being a Harvard professor of psychiatry), have said that many of the abductees they interviewed have said that the aliens have attempted to extract the souls from their bodies. Along with this topic, most abduction testimonies have to do with our genetics and/or sex. Many abductees have reported being forced into sex with aliens, or having eggs/sperm extracted. 


------------------------------------------------------------------



**My notes:** There is quite a bit more that I did not type out here. If you have the stomach for it, I recommend reaching Nigel Kerner's research on this topic or ""Area 51"" by Nick Redfern. There is significantly more testimony from both credible, and some non-credible, individuals that they have compiled. There is even some small amount of evidence that the moon was not always in our skies, and that it was moved there at some point in history - with the speculation being that it is used to harvest our souls, in a factory-farm fashion.


 The only other thing I'll add is it seems clear that UFOs have a keen interest in our atomic capabilities. Note that they don't seem to have an interest in our non-atomic weapons, as there are significantly far fewer sightings over military bases without nuclear weapons than over those with nuclear weapons. Further, there seem to be a significant number of sightings also over nuclear energy (non-weapon) facilities. My conjecture/speculation on this is that, if they are interested in harvesting our souls perhaps they are concerned about what might happen in the event of a nuclear war. Even more conjecture - perhaps death as a result of a nuclear weapon also eliminates the soul, not just our physical bodies - which is why they find it so much more concerning than pandemics, traditional warfare, and heart disease/cancer deaths. 

 


Again, I consider myself a very logical person and personally find this hypothesis extremely disturbing - it has kept me up most nights. Otherwise I do not tend toward conspiracy theories and am of sound mind. I'm an atheist and am not convinced a soul really exists in the traditional sense. **I really want to hear other hypothesis of why aliens are here - preferably with testimonials or some shred of evidence - to help me get this possibility out of my head.**




Also - I posted something like this a week ago and it wasn't as detailed or cohesive as I wanted it to be, so this is my second post on this topic - in case anyone is experiencing some de ja vú.",Why they come here

aliens,"First off, I consider myself agnostic, and I mean no disrespect for you religious folk.

I was listening to an episode of the JRE recently and Rogan was talking about the Bible and aliens. I dont consider myself a conspiracy therorist, as a matter of fact I am usually very scientific. I also went to catholic school for 12 years, so I feel like I am pretty versed Christian beliefs.

If you believe that aliens played a factor in our evolution, and if you believe Lazar's story, specifically about the archeological dig. Isn't it conceivable that Jesus was an alien? It explains many of the unexplainable ""phenomena"" with some biblical story. A couple examples:

- The Virgin Mary
- Turning Water into Wine
- Miracles of Healing
- The Resurrection 

Also, Heaven could be a synonym for space. God could be a metaphor for the mothership. It seems aliens are interested/drawn to our use of nuclear weapons. Obviously, the atom wasn't split in Jesus' era, but perhaps Jesus' teachings of honor, honesty, and living a righteous life is their way of steering our evolution and behaviors to eventually reduce the likelihood that we would be destructive apes.

At the time, I was certain I was visited by something, but through the years as I've gotten older and learned more I've wondered- was it just sleep paralysis? I've never had sleep paralysis before (besides possibly this experience) so here's the story for you guys.

I wake up around 3am, wide awake, so I decide to watch a few old anime reruns on TV before trying to fall back asleep. Still wide awake after  10 to 15 minutes, I hear my door open and something come in. Then it starts chanting. For the first 2 seconds, I was convinced it was my dad coming in to mess with me. It didn't take long for my heart to drop as I realized, there's no way in hell he could make this voice, let alone anything I could fathom in existence with this voice. The closest thing I've ever heard to come close is the ""oh long Johnson"" cat, but even then it was higher pitched, more nasally, and gravelly. It was chanting ""Day, die, doe, dowwww"" over and over, dozens of times. 

For the duration of this, I'm just completely freaked out, still laying in the same position I had been when it entered, eyes closed (because I did not want to see whatever this thing was) and at no point did I move or scream, because in my mind I did not want to piss this thing off or trigger it or something. I'm crying, heart racing, adrenaline rushing, and eventually it just goes quiet. I stayed there just listening, imagining whatever this thing is just staring at me. But after maybe 20-30 minutes, I finally muster up the guts to open my eyes. It's 10am. I'm certain at no point did I fall asleep, my heartrate stayed pretty consistently up for the duration of this event.

This could've been huge news but you know what the general public attitude is like. 

Back to my point, now most of you are familiar with the  patterns of mutilated cattle. It's usually the reproductive/sense organs that get taken. The reasons for that aren't clear but the prevalent theory for now is that they're collecting samples for genetic research.

Throughout the thousands of cases reported, autopsy reports have shown that they're done without anesthetic and as the animal is alive. Probably for the sake of clean and fresh samples.

(There is a Vet who collected detailed information about this, I will tag his website here later)

An often not discussed detail in all of those cases is that the carcass is always found on the ranch it got taken from. Usually within 40m diameter of where it was last seen. I find this quite eerie. If they really just want samples why not dispose of the rest of it? Why leave it where it can be found by it's owners? If they've really been monitoring this planet they know we can perform autopsies to figure out the gruesome way it died. 

This is just my personal opinion/speculation. The evidence could use more refining but so far I find it dauntingly ominous.

2) Advanced alien civilizations in fact do exist and earthlings just haven't discovered them yet. Or we have and it's being kept secret, by either us or them.

3) Intelligent life is too fragile, and it always results in the lifeforms own destruction (exhaustion of resources, destruction of planet, etc).

Instead let's break it down from a timeline perspective, to answer the following: Could humanity be an early civilization? 

\- Universe was created 13.8 billion Years ago.

\- Before any potentially life sustaining planets can form, stars have to form, exist long enough to create the building blocks for life (carbon &amp; other elements created through fusion in star core) and then die in a magnificent explosion, spilling their guts out into the galaxy. Then over time gravity clumps all those star guts together to form new stars and planets. The time for this to happen varies tremendously.

\- Since the universe has been expanding since it's creation, it reasons that the early universe would have been much more dense with matter. As such, one can assume collisions between interstellar objects would have been more frequent. Any collision with enough energy would certainly upset the progress of any evolving life on that planet, as we've seen in the earth's own history.

Multiple studies have also confirmed that earth and the milky way galaxy are in a ""cosmic void"",  largely devoid of other galaxies, stars and planets. This also lends to the argument that our planet would be less frequently impacted by some life-disrupting impact with an interstellar object.

\- The earth it's self is 4.54 billion years old, and intelligent life here still hasn't achieved interstellar capability. 

\- The vast majority of planets discovered are seemingly uninhabitable places with hellish landscapes. Extreme temperatures, lack of atmosphere, etc. A planet with the assumed ingredients for life (water, atmosphere, magnetic field) is extremely rare in the grand total of things. The Drake Equation estimates that only one in a trillion stars create a habitable zone capable of supporting life. Furthermore, the evolution into intelligent life isn't by any means a guarantee, even if life does exist elsewhere, so the probability of intelligent life on any given planet is a mere fraction of the odds that a planet is inhabitable.

Given all the above, is it not possible that humanity actually is an early civilization in the grand scheme of the universe? Perhaps one of relatively few civilizations that are separated by unfathomable distances across space-time.

Yes, even ""relatively few"" intelligent civilizations could very well mean that there are tens of thousands of such civilizations out there, given that there are an estimated 70 quintillion planets orbiting stars in the universe, but when you consider the vastness of the universe, if these civilizations are distributed across the universe then they could be millions of light-years between them.

There are approximately 100 tribes of indigenous peoples, that have extremely limited to no contact to the outside world.

All of these tribes such as the Sentinelese, the Awa etc.. would be there, or more then halfway so to speak.  

So why don’t these beings just have these tribes come out of isolation with their message?

aliens,"We all know cattle mutilation cases but rarely any person knows human mutilation cases.
I've started to investigate in that topic as at least somebody needs to do the job and I start to come across a lot of general issues most people on the world aren't aware of and I wasn't aware of them either till I started investigating.
Rn I'm collecting cases in order to get a better overview of how big the issue of HM cases is.

I don't want you to grow extremely paranoid but I also want you to not ignore the reality of what's going on so I'll give you an overlook of what is known so far. You'll also realise the similarities between HM and CM cases.

1. Cattle and human victims are dissected while being alive.
2. Cattle and human victims share the same wounds (missing eyes, missing blood, application of heat etc.).
3. There is no victim profile. Whether it being male or female etc., everybody can become a victim.
4. Usage of specialised equipment, knowledge of anatomy and surgical precision.
5. It happens seemingly everywhere.

There are of course more aspects, but the ones listed above are the most important ones as far as I can tell.
The problem with investigating in such cases is to know where to look for information. Everything is available online but hidden in forums most people have never heard of, often on some shady forums where you might get a computer virus.

In general there is not much evidence available except the bodies themselves which is why the cases become cold cases. Often they get closed with seemingly mundane or unlogical causes of death, still no suspects gets ever caught.

There are 2 possibilities, 1. it's humans who or 2. it's aliens. It is highly unlikely that some random people go dissecting other random people and have such knowledge of anatomy, the right equipment etc. What stands out most is that who ever kills the people is looking for specific body parts and thus knows what he/she/they is/are doing.
It may be a global organisation of organ traders which go collecting organs some of you might assume. But then again why collecting eyes, mussle tissue, soft tissue, parts of bones? And why collecting the blood, even parts of the genitals? There is some aspects which just stand out which indicate that it isn't a crime committed by a group of humans. And the way the organs are being removed, which is by cutting holes and carving out the desired organs, isn't a procedure humans (doctors or not) follow. In general the dissection process is anything but standard.

The thing why most people aren't aware of what's going on is the amount of secrecy surrounding these cases. The police departments keep their mouths shut and the media doesn't get the information. The relatives of the victims as well.
If anythig gets to the public then only via private investigators or via leaks. It's a gruesome topic and most people don't want to even think about it. But that is the reason why those who kill all the people can continue what they are doing.

It seems to be a matter of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Still I want you to keep an eye out and if possible make others aware of the issue.
If you're even investigating or just started out/are interested in the topic then sure we can exchange information. I'm looking for some other cases so I can expand my collection. I can also share what I have so far if anybody is curious, just dm me.

Stay safe, keep an eye on your friends and family and thx for reading.

If they do really come from different planets in the universe, why would their advanced technology be proof that they are spiritually better than us? If we look at our history, every industrial revolution and technological discovery was seen as hope for a better future but instead resulted in the same old problem just in different forms, so what would advanced space travel prove when it comes to peace and harmony? 

And if instead they're ultraterrestrials, moving between the different planes of reality, why would that mean that they want to help us or that they know what's best for us? What if we are just a form of entertainment for them? 

Another thing that bugs me when I read stories of elaborate contact with aliens is all the manipulation on their part. They cause missing time, they alter people's emotions (i.e. ""all of the sudden I wasn't scared anymore""), they make people do things without them even knowing why. How can we trust something that can influence us that much? Am I missing something?",Why do we think that aliens want to help us?

aliens,"Still they don’t know the most crucial fact:

These objects don’t come from other planets as we think in time and space.

They higher/lower the vibrational rate of the craft. (Via technology or mind). 

Now it looks like they materialize here out of nothing. They don’t come from the space.

In their Dimension / Reality. The so called ship has another structure. Probably it’s even only a thought form.

Now the ship has a quantum physical problem. For the „crew“ are still the physical laws active that they know, because they bend a gravitational field around the craft, but for everything outside the craft, our physical laws are true/correct.

So it’s a massive power that works on the craft. It has to decide to which physical laws it has to work. That’s why it sometimes „jerk“ in the air.
For example: a craft made by mankind would simply fall to the ground now like an Apple. Or even worse.

That’s why the object we see can look very small or very big, that is not the true form of the object. We can’t observe the true form of the Object. We simply see, what we want to see !

Now imagine this „craft“ would crash or hit something like a mountain: in this scenario the craft would have to apply to our physical laws, because it’s interact with an solid object in our 3D.

The craft can maneuver with 1000g acceleration and doing impossible movings that would be against our physical laws - without breaking them.

The silhouette figure then turned towards where his walk-in wardrobe was, followed by 3 (about 4ft) sort of minions, if you will. These 4 figures than walked into his walk-in wardrobe and disappeared. Bob decided to climb out of his bed to try and see where they were going/what they were up to, however, he said the room started to light up and spin which scared him so Bob jumped back into bed and hid.

aliens,"So I'm not saying this is for sure a UFO but I'm not sure what it was.
My and my buddy were leaving work the other night when we were walking to our cars in the sky there was a green fire ball(?) falling towards the earth.
Here is why I don't think if its a shooting star.
1.) I've never seen a green shooting star
2.) It seemed much bigger. If you describe a shooting star as a dime this thing was a quarter.
3.) The tail looked more like fire. It didn't have like a full tail but a short fire-esque tail.
4.) It seemed to be breaking off parts. As it was falling you could see little green pieces breaking away.
5.) Normally when you see a shootijg star it is seen for a long time. Like you could follow this across the sky. This thing just kinda appeared in within 5 seconds it dissapeared. It didn't get out of eyesight, it literly dissapeared.
Does anyone know what this could have been or can give me any info? I would love to get some clarification.",I think me and my friend may have seen something strange. Help?

aliens,"Hey guys! I’m going to tell you my strange story that’s happened to me when I was younger. I was 6 yrs old when this happened, I was in a Mexican small village my parents had a restaurant and we would sleep in a back of the building,So one night I wake up late at night going to the bathroom and I see a gay figure just sitting by the corner so I froze the that’s spot. (You had not idea how frightened I was specially at that age.) I tried to scream to wake my parents up and nothing was coming out as I just stand there this thing it looking at me it doesn’t move just stand there, I don’t really remember what the face looked like.this thing is coming toward me and I can’t seem to move from that spot, I gather all my strengths and ran toward my bed, as a kid I just cover myself with my blanket and pick a little to see if this thing is still coming toward me. I wasn’t dreaming I know that for a fact but this thing looked a little taller then I was it look like it was wearing a gray skin tight suite so I scream to my mom comes rushing in my room and after rush in my bedroom this is where it get more strange. She just see this gray creature and doesn’t do or said anything. She just sit by the foot of my bed and stares at this thing without saying anything. It looks like they are talking through telepathy or something. So gather my strength one more time and push this thing and it felt very soft to the touch. After that I go blank all I know it’s already morning and I was just sitting up in my bed. I can still remember all of what happened. I’m 26yrs so almost 20yrs this thought haunts me. I told my mom about it but she doesn’t remember anything. What do you guys think?",Alien

aliens,"My dad has always been obsessed with aliens, he sits there and watches all types of alien shows. I remember when I was little that’s all we really talked about when we were alone. My dad grew up in a wooded area of PA, and we moved to FL when I was young. Pretty great spots of aliens. My theory here is that us humans can’t tell when it’s an alien unless we have seen one. I began my interests on aliens after reading a few comments on a “I saw an alien” you tube video. She explained that she sees aliens dressed as humans. she also explains how they may be reptilians + could be a piece to the reptilian conspiracy. They can look like us, she says she has an instinct to tell when things aren’t human (I do believe this youtuber because she seems to be at a higher vibration based on her other videos) she explained that after she saw one in a coffee shop she could instantly tell when she saw them on the street/bus/anywhere. the comments on the video said “be careful.” “Don’t talk about this... you-tubers have gone missing” and I believe it. Once ur woke they will visit you, they will have interaction with you. My dad sees “UFOS” all the time in FL. A lot of times he goes to the beach at 3:00am with my step mom and watch for them along with the stars/meteors! When I was 8-9 I used to have to sleep with my dad every night because I would Astro plan into a universe where we all get taken by aliens. The sky was red. Everyone was running around screaming. They were tying people up and taking them on to their ship. One night I even woke up from my dream and saw little men all around my room staring at me, they were gonna wrap me up and take me to their ship. (They honestly probably did) Idk I have a distinct memory of a bright light and them taking me and my dad but maybe I’ve seen too many movies) Just makes me think if maybe I was dreaming of a universe where they came down and were violent. I know they have the ability to make people forget. I know they probably mark people *kinda like American Horror Story* 
A friend at work of mine told me about a case where a woman lost her son. Never found the Body, SWORE IT WAS EXTRA TERRESTRIAL. I believe a mother’s intuition is REAL, but others say she killed him. No body found. Sorry but these creatures are real, they are smart. Our government would never understand them and that’s why they are hiding. We have so much to learn from them. Who knows maybe there is good aliens and bad aliens.. maybe they are time travelers but from my research. They look different. In the Roswell case they tried to cover it up “In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed object: a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul.”  It wasn’t a balloon. It was a little space craft. They covered it up. There was even a body found. A little guy with big eyes only 3-4 ft tall. Do more research, I find YouTube videos are the easiest way to understand the twists and turns of the REAL story. We need to be more woke. It’s almost 2020 and the government has only admitted to an “unexplainable flash” on their systems.. yeah ok boomer we know it’s ALEINS thx. Where do you think we came up with the CD player device ? We leaned that through the machines on the ship @ rosewell. You won’t see spotting in the city, they know it’s too risky. I’ve seen various UFOS in my little town. I think they watch over us to make sure our planets environment doesn’t go to complete shit. Who knows ? Maybe they’re studying us from a far and only taking select things from this planet to their planet. Maybe they are looking to see what WE know that they don’t? Hopefully I don’t get abducted after posting this.

There is a lot of backstory to get where I’m going, but I’m going to try and keep it as short as possible so please stick with me. Please. 

We bought our house almost 7 years ago as a foreclosure and had no information about it. We’ve never found anything crazy in the houses history, but most everyone who has come in our house has had an experience, so we originally though something more paranormal was happening. We used to hear cabinets slamming in the middle of the night, my mother in law saw a little girl in the room where most things happen in, people have heard their names, my husband and I have both heard each other in the laundry room hollering when we’ll be in a completely different part of the house. We have 2 rooms downstairs and a split level room upstairs. We originally only used the 2 downstairs rooms and coslept with our first. At 2 months old I rolled over to check on him and he wasn’t in the bed. We found him sound asleep in the middle of our bedroom floor. My oldest son is 6 and my youngest is 2 (almost 3). When I got pregnant with our second we moved our room upstairs and turned our room into the nursery. When my son turned 5 we decided he needed the bigger room and for the last year my youngest son has had the room where my oldest saw the “white man” and where most people have said they feel uncomfortable.

When my oldest son was 3 he started talking about a “white man”. We thought he was seeing a spirit, but he’d start saying things that didn’t make any sense. He’d say things like “why didn’t you help me when I was yelling for you”. He told us that the white man would speak to him in his head. He told us that the white man would visit him at night and one day he tried to run to our room but the white man was at the top of our stairs waiting for him. He said he’d scream for us but we couldn’t hear him. He’d talk about how the white man would take him far away and watch him. He said when he took him far away in his airplane that they’d go to the present store. They’d let him pick presents and then watch him behind a glass window. He said he couldn’t see his face though because it was all white and that he didn’t know what his voice sounded like because he always spoke in his head. When he was 4 we were watching Dark skies and he walked in and got terrified and said that’s what the white man looked like. After that he never spoke about him again and still doesn’t because he gets so scared. 

Well, my youngest son will be 3 in February. He’s been acting strange and getting scared at night for the past 2 weeks. Tonight he mentioned a “bad man”. He said the bad man comes to his window and watches him. He said he’s white and spooky. This is our first mention from him, but he has a chromosomal abnormality which delay’s his speech so we can’t communicate with him to get anymore information than “bad man spooky”, “scared”, “bad man coming”, and “white” when asked what he looks like. I showed him a picture of a typical grey and he pointed and said “bad man”. I’m 100% sure this isn’t a coincidence.

I just have never heard of any aliens described as having no face and all white. Have any of you? Both boys have identified grey’s as what they are scared of, but because of other things in our house I wonder if it’s paranormal.

I’m just scared and not sure what to do or how to help. Can anyone help?",The “white man”

aliens,"I’ve been following along and watching lots of seemingly real encounters and information on here and documentaries and shows like Hanger 1 on Netflix which had a lot more in depth looks into some of the encounters discussed on “The Phenomenon” and all the JRE podcasts as such. The common theme seems to be that aliens did meet and communicate with US and possibly other governments and they said something to them that obviously scared some of them pretty badly. What do you think that was?

Do you think it’s absolutely unfathomable to believe that some of the things that may be true are so unbelievable that scary that the government just obliged?  

So some ideas I have which aren’t that wild are that maybe Earth is used as a planetary base for these aliens and they need the underground centres to help them reproduce or reenergize. Maybe they feed off the blood of children because they have young DNA and cells that can be useful to them? Maybe that’s why it’s so secretive?  I know Qanon would say yes to this. Is this where it comes from? Maybe the government is run by ETs in human forms. 

But besides the obvious “not wanting to cause panic” or “listening just to appease the aliens”, what would be such a wild reason to NOT tell the public about these guys all these years? What are these aliens up to on earth and on earth and under water and in our sky’s...?",What could be the BIG reason why governments were so scared into not telling the public about UFOs from the ETs?

And just like the ground in Pandora that was interconnected and all beings communicated with each other via the ground glowing connecting fibers that also took back the animals or Navi that died, so too do we have that at earth.  We got a glowing fiber connecting trees and is everywhere on Earth and it takes back the dead back to earth.    The fibers we have are under ground and they bring nutrients to trees and allows trees to communicate with each other to keep the balance of the nutrients they use between each other and smaller plants.

aliens,"So it wasn’t until recent years that I actually believed in life outside of this world. Growing up as a kid, I was born and raised as a Catholic, as I would’ve considered myself moderately religious. I was never told to question anything, just to follow along and believe everything. A few years ago I decided to trip on acid for the first time and ever since that day, I’ve only been able to question my own religion. An idea had occurred to me about how human life started on Earth. 

What if billions of years ago, some intelligent alien life was inhabiting some other planet, when something happened. Maybe some sort of doomsday plagued their home. Searching through galaxies for planets that imitate habitable life, eventually striking upon Earth. When they get here, Earth had currently been inhabited to what we know as dinosaurs. 

Are we really supposed to believe that one day, there was a massive meteor shower that struck down a majority of life? I say to hell with that. What if these aliens came to Earth and completely wiped out these dinosaurs, as they knew they would not be able to start a new life on this planet with these creatures. It is known that there is life forms out there way more intelligent and advanced than we are. It would’ve been nothing for them to wipe out off these giant creatures. Thus leading to the beginning of a new life, where they left some of their kind on Earth to adapt, evolve and become who we are right now. 

Has anyone else noticed the odd resemblance of depicted aliens from accounts and records? Supposedly grey figures, with larger brains, two large eyes, a small nose, small mouth. This is how they ended up evolving after living life on another planets/throughout space, whereas humans adapted differently, but still very similar. 

The reason there has been alien sightings all throughout history is because they have been checking in on us. Studying us. Guiding us. Seeing how we live our lives and see how we have adapted over the years. We could be their offspring.

aliens,"So, theorists claim that there was an all-out ancient nuclear war...which means we’ve got sanskrit war epics, desert glass, and Robert Oppenheimer to talk about. So sip that coffee and strap in. We’re starting in ancient India. 

**How about a glass of Ice cold Fusion?**

The [*Bhagavad-Gita*](https://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-2nd-Eknath-Easwaran/dp/1586380192), the great Indian war epic completed around the 2nd century BCE, is a mythic text. But the descriptions of the wars inside it have led to theories that these battles weren’t just stories. 

In the *Bhagavad-Gita,* the “Book of Drona,” describes magical weapons called astra that could destroy entire armies, “causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees.” (That could just be describing any explosive, but wait, there’s more. Sooo much more.)

The most devastating astra was known as the brahmastra. It was depicted as a “single projectile charged with all the power in the universe...a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race. There was neither a counter attack nor a defense that could stop it.” (Now we’re getting closer to nuclear. If only there was something that described the mushroom-like cloud or toxic aftereffects, right???)

The brahmastra was said to produce “an incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns that rose in all its splendor. After, corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned white…After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected.” 

Doesn’t that sound like [Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://www.history.com/news/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bomb-photos-before-after)? 

**Never trust an atom…they make up everything.** 

Now I know what you’re thinking. *Okay, cool, an old story. Is that all you’ve got? Really?*

Oh, we’ve got more. See, there’s a substance known as [trinitite](https://science.howstuffworks.com/trinitite-first-nuclear-bomb-turned-sand-to-glass.htm). It forms when a nuclear blast turns sand into glass and received its name from the Trinity team, which tested the [first nuclear explosion](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/07/75-years-after-bomb/614260/) in the United States. Trinitite is often also referred to as desert glass, nuclear glass, and atomic glass. 

Albion Hart, an engineer on the Trinity team, first noticed and examined the trinitite. He claimed it was identical to material he’d seen a decade earlier in the African desert. Further, he even noted that the amount he’d seen in Africa would have had to come from a blast 10 times the size of the Trinity bomb! But, alas, no one believed him at the time. 

However, since then, trinitite has been discovered in neolithic, Sumerian, Babylonian, and ancient Egyptian archaeological sites in modern day Egypt, Libya, and Iraq. Trinitite was even found in the tomb of [curse-enthusiast](https://conspiracynibbles.substack.com/p/the-curse-of-king-tut) King Tut, decorating [a necklace](https://craighusar.com/blog/1172018king-tuts-breastplate-features-a-scarab-carved-from-rare-libyan-desert-glass) he wore...

Importantly, the glass found in Libya is estimated to be over 28 million years old. According to our calculator app, that’s uhh, really old. 

**Any other explanations for this? Yeah, if you’re boring.**  

Many scientists dismiss the ancient nuclear war theory, asserting that trinitite can also form from meteor blasts and lightning strikes. 

However, it should be pointed out that meteor blast glass tends to [bead up](https://www.livescience.com/62250-glass-spherules-ancient-crater.html), and doesn’t look too much like the trinitite found after nuclear blasts. And if it was lightning, that’s quite a lot of strikes. 

Before we move on, there’s a quote from [Robert Oppenheimer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/J-Robert-Oppenheimer), a member of the Trinity team that we found interesting. When he was asked whether the Trinity explosion was the first ever atomic detonation, Oppenheimer replied: “Yes, in modern times.” Sounds like our guy Bobby O. was on board with this one. 

**Enjoy some conspiratorial dives on the topic**

So I guess the question is...did an ancient, technologically-advanced civilization self-destruct into modern humanity’s Stone Age? If you want to take a deeper dive:

aliens,"So to start off this dream happened about 2-3 years ago, but it's one of the only ones in my life that I still remember vividly. My ex and I were laying in bed together, she was awake watching TV and I was sleeping (this is significant). In my dream my ex and I were out on my balcony where we would usually smoke and it was dark. A bright light shined above us and I looked up at the object which looked like a UFO. I looked back down at my ex and her eyes were huge and pitch black (like in a possession movie) and her mouth was wide open (like in the movie the Fourth Kind). In that moment I felt an extreme amount of fear which caused me to snap out of the dream but I didn't come to immediately. 

This is where it gets weird.

When I awoke from the dream I didn't come to immediately. My ex said I sat straight up very fast from a laying position into a 90 degree angle (I can't even do that while awake) and I immediately grabbed my forehead. When I started to come to it felt like someone was taking a extremely hot poker and sticking it straight through my forehead into the center of my brain. The pain was so intense tears were rolling down my face, I couldn't move my hands from my forehead, nor could I speak. My ex looked very concerned and helped me relax until I fell back asleep.

aliens,"Before I go further into my experience. I want to be straight forward and just let everyone know that I’ve been experiencing nightmares/sleep paralysis recently. 

I’ve been really trying to figure out what I went through or if it was just another nightmare, some things just don’t add up. Nevertheless, my sister and I work together. Usually we take turns carpooling. We do a 6pm-2am shift so usually I’m pretty beat when we get off. Well this particular night I was super tired and the night really just seemed like a blur to me. It was my sisters turn to drive so I was kind of relieved it wasn’t my turn. I remember getting into the car, but after that I totally blacked out or something. It could be possible that I feel asleep. (Mind you, I haven’t really been getting great sleep since I’ve been having countless nightmares.) I remember having this vivid dream. I was with my sister in our town and we for some reason weren’t in the car. I remember in my dream there was a loud sound almost like ringing, I just remember looking up into the dark sky where I seen a UFO. In my dream I was terrified. It looked like it was out into the distance, but for some odd reason I have a lot of fear. I kept telling my sister “come on let’s go”, but she seemed shocked and just wanted to take a picture. I remember trying to run, but I couldn’t. It’s weird because in this “vivid dream”, I felt like I was dreaming so I was trying to wake myself up, but I couldn’t. I remember just looking down at my feet and looking back at the UFO and saw my sister and I just slowly levitating off the ground. Whatever I went through dream or not was a big blur to me. I don’t remember coming home that night, nor do I remember falling  asleep either the last thing I remember was getting into the car and my memory was shot. When I woke up the next day I was still in the same clothes and laying on my couch, that’s definitely not like me. The odd part is that I asked my sister about it the next day. And she said I wasn’t like myself. She said she would ask me a question and I’d take a while to answer. Usually when we drop each other off we’ll wait for the other to open the door and get into our home before leaving. Usually when my sister drops me off I always wavy at her and immediately turn on my lights. (I’m terrified of the dark) She stated that night I never waved at her nor did I turn the lights on. She said she waited about two minutes before leaving to see if I’d turn them on, but I never did. Then the rest of the night to her was a blur. She said she was so tired that she thinks maybe she forgot when or how she got home.. I really don’t know what to think of this or if maybe all that was a coincidence and I was just super tired. It’s all just crazy to me.",Abducted or was I just dreaming?

I believe i was abducted over the course of those years, bi monthly. The first night I remember it happening, I was laying in bed and something seemed to snap me out of my sleep but I couldn’t move, my door opened and in walks what I can describe as a very tall, big slant eyed grey alien. I black out. This happened to me bi monthly, with every encounter varying from the last. Every time they were close, something would trigger me to wake up, and i couldn’t move. I was never scared, always nervous. Sometimes I would come to, but i couldn’t see a lot. But... I would sometimes see a glow, a red-orange glow when I would open my eyes, but i could never look directly at what was emitting this glow, and then I would black out again. One time I think I woke up on some sort of table, all I could see was one standing over me in a room that was so bright and all I could hear was a whirring sound. I looked up at this thing and then blacked out again. This happened to me for years, and I think I was studied. They abruptly stopped one year, and I remember the last time it happened clearly.

aliens,"I don't believe in aliens but I am interested in them.
So far I didn't had (probably) experiences with them,but I still have had some really weird experiences I was thinking I should share.

First of all,the most interesting one. Among other things,I have a farm house at a village. When I was young many times I was dreaming one same dream and a possible OOBE.
I am not entirely certain how all that was beginning but I think I was in the bed at start in my village house. Suddenly I would begin flying and would be going in the direction of our orchard, where a big walnut tree is present. I am not entirely certain but I think that in most or all of dreams there was my old grandfather below it, possibly making a basket out of branches and possibly other people from my family. I am not 100% certain if all my dreams themed like this were 100% same since a lot of time has past since I dreamt this the last time. After I would approach the tree,I would suddenly wake up a moment before I hit it. I dreamt this dream many times but I wasn't thinking it is something weird back then. 
What do you think?Is this an OOBE or something related to aliens?I would like to know.

The second experience is recent and I think it is still happening. Sometimes on the other sides of the closed doors with glass on them I see something like a ghost or a being with a large head. Probably pareidolia,but I don't know. Really.

The third one is also very recent, possibly earlier than the second but I don't know.
A few times recently a picture of grey like aliens,but with oval and possibly red eyes and traces of greenish colour was suddenly arriving in my head, combined with sudden fear of aliens and a wish to run. Could be an imagination (I am good at them),but maybe also could not. My relationship with otherworldly is complex:I sometimes love them and believe they exist,sometimes I am totally afraid of them, sometimes I think they are non- existent. It is also notable that I believe in God a lot. While I can watch Star Wars without problems,I would probably die if I see a real alien in front of me.

What do you think? What were these things?Are they connected with aliens?

Have a good day!

aliens,"Hi,

I don't believe in flying saucers or gray aliens which abduct people but in any case one of the most intriguing elements of the narrative involves the apparent plan to create viable alien-human hybrids. This would presumably entail the creation of lifeforms of intellectual and cognitive abilities equal to that of a human/alien (whichever one ranks lowest out of the two) but which was also capable of bringing healthy, viable offspring to term using strictly biological reproduction methods (I imagine that the rate of miscarriage, stillbirths or deformities would need to be no higher than 10%). Basically you would have the creation of a species capable of existing independently and naturally growing a population and civilization if the technological element was regressed or removed.

Now to me at least this seems like a monumental challenge and an incredible feat for a purported race to actually achieve. Bear in mind that we ourselves can only create hybrids between genetically similar species (more-or-less anyway) e.g. tiger and lion, donkey and horse and assuming the hybrid can even breed to begin with (usually they can't) its difficult for it to produce healthy, live young. Bear in mind these are genetically similar species - the aliens would have found a way to produce a viable, intelligent hybrid race between two species which not only operate beneath vastly different genetic codes but which didn't even evolve in the same primordial soup! When both efforts are compared it would be the equivalent of building the Great Pyramid of Giza compared to building a sandcastle. The magnitude and scale of the achievement is immediately self-evident.

In any case, would it actually be theoretically possible for a sufficiently advanced species e.g. humans 5000 years from now to actually create a hybrid race by combining its DNA with a completely alien one? If yes how difficult would it actually be? IIRC the gray alien narrative states that initial hybridization is achieved by injecting human fetuses with alien DNA and then injecting that hybrid DNA into another human fetus (and so on) until you have a hybrid stable enough biologically to survive and reproduce. But even then I imagine actually getting the alien DNA to successfully ""fuse"" with the human DNA would be immeasurably difficult and making it so one half of the genome does not reject the other to be even more so.

Many thanks.","Would it be theoretically possible for us to create e.g. a human-alien hybrid? If yes, then how difficult would it be?"

aliens,"New to this subreddit, and just realized I could put this info out here to see if anyone else possibly saw what I saw back in 2012. 

My friends and I were camping in Leadville at Turquoise Lake around June or July. We were camping along the eastern side of the lake.  Yes, we had been drinking but I was only buzzed during this sighting. I was with my boyfriend-now-husband, a good guy friend, and best friend that was visiting. My best friend and I were on the same level as buzzed when we saw what we did. 

It was nighttime and I wanted to look at the stars over the lake along the beach, so my friend and I went to do just that. (There are so many stars out there!). It was a clear sky, no clouds to be seen, and on the opposite end of the lake there were silhouettes of 2 mountains, littered with stars behind and above them. It was gorgeous. 

We were just talking and admiring the reflection and view when we both saw this white light in the distance. It seemed as far away as the stars, but perhaps a tad bigger in size, and was between the 2 mountains at about mountain peak level. But it was moving. And not airplane/satellite/helicopter in the sky moving. It was erratic, had no rhyme or reason other than it seemed to buzz around in the same general area. Left-Up-Down-Right-Up-Down...no consistency or repeating. It couldn’t have been a plane/helicopter with the distance it would move-planes and helicopters don’t move THAT fast or in the directions it was going. I had never seen this before! My friend and I both saw it and couldn’t explain it away. My boyfriend popped over at some point and although he was drunk, he did admit that he could see what we did and couldn’t figure it out.

I wanted desperately to keep watching, but my friend was tired and I wasn’t about to hang out there alone.

Hi, I have been trying to find answers to this experience for years. I wanted to post her and see what you guys think about this experience and what it could have been visiting me. 

About 10 years ago I was lying in bed one night sleeping, and I woke up around 3-3:30 am. I was completely wide awake and just rolled around in my bed trying to get comfortable to fall back asleep. Eventually I rolled towards my doorway, and laid there staring into the hall. Directly across the hall was the bathroom, and right next to it was my sisters room.

As I was laying there I saw the bathroom door handle begin to jiggle. Moments later, the bathroom door slowly creaked open. I was terrified because the bathroom door was CLOSED, and would need some sort of force to be opened.. out stepped a very tall completely opaque black shadow figure. It turned to look the direction of my sisters room, and then slowly turned to the direction of my room. It started to slowly walk towards my room, and i was trembling. Tears started to pour down my face, without me even realizing it. Whatever this thing was looked disfigured I guess?? It was about 8 feet tall, and had lumps along its arms. The head had some of the similar bumps and protruding objects, and also indentions. 

As it got closer i pulled my covers over my face and tried to hide I guess. All of a sudden i had a feeling he was there, and lifted my covers from my eyes. This thing was standing in my doorway. It was about to take another step forward, and out of instinct my arm flew to my bedside lamp and flicked it on. As soon as the lamp came on, this creature began to fade out. 

Scariest experience of my life. I will never forget it, it was so vivid. And I know this isnt sleep paralysis because I moved so much during this. I could not fall asleep for nights. 

Thanks for reading and i hope you can help me identify what this entity is, i appreciate it",Tall dark shadow figure

&amp;#x200B;

**Skinny Bob Notes and details**

Details are what make the videos compelling. I have tried to rate the level of importance for detail out of 10 because not all are clear/easily seen or very convincing. This is a sort of self-check and admission to others.  1/10 is low importance/lower evidence to consider and 10/10 is highest.

&amp;#x200B;

**Full admission**

1) The quality of the video are poor. My interpretation is film reel to digital, like VHS, to tripod recorded off a screen.

2) The clips are short. Longer would be better of course.

3) Some clips are very shaky, however that shake and the artifacts it creates are consistent for object movement. Keyframing CGI movement does not always line up with camera movement and there is no such indication of CGI keyframing issues, and thus interpreted as consistent with natural movement of the camera and objects being filmed. (8/10)

4) List of theatrical movies with possibly comparable facial CGI detail: Avatar (2009), Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), and Paul (aliens) (2011). CGI at the time *could* have been good enough, but those are major films with budgets ran $40 to $240 million. Corresponding clip segments and cost would be associated with making these clips as realistic as the movies listed above. (7/10)

5) There is one head movement of Skinny Bob that is very jerky. It is the only time in that clip it makes me pause. (5/10). Point is important to consider, but doesn’t debunk, especially with respects to the entire compilation of content and because the video frame rate is lower and thus sharper movements would be assumed due to portions of the movement missing as it is not 24+ frames per second. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall video series points**

1) Videos were released by Ivan0135 in chronological order. (4/10)

2) So much content and tells a coherent story. (7/10)

3) To plan and make all the different clips and ideas would be hugely difficult and time consuming. (9/10)

4) No one has claimed ownership or credit since 2011. (6/10)

5) Different black out box shape for timestamp coverings in each clip. (6/10)

6) 60’s clip are better quality framerate without ticking noise (indicates some form of digital tape recording). (7/10)  

7) One cannot take the video series and speed it up to make it proper frame rate. If it was recorded at say 14 frames. There is a claim of 12 frames per second and that might be low but to speed up a video to 18 or more frames per second interjects more variables than analyzing the video and content as is. The 18 frames per second also seems goofy and too fast. Dimmer bulbs could also allow for slower frame rates, however this is just conjecture. Frame rate speed is a minor point IMO, but could be deeply expanded on if desired. (3/10)

8) Each sound waveform from the shutter speed is unique. This is extreme level of detail to include if this has been fabricated. Another point is that there are some frames that do not line up with each sound waveform. This, in one case in the seated skinny bob clip, took around 27 waveforms to add one image frame. In the UFO flying videos there are some added frames. The only early explanation is that when recording from film projector to record tape and then digitized some frames and audio sounds were lengthened or shortened based on the recording device and its frame rate of recording. Recording to a newer device will seemingly add the occasional frame, and audio should be recorded exactly as what is being produced from the earlier version. I.e. sound recording is seemingly continuous and not ""broken into slides"". All this needs to be examined further with a full analysis.  (7/10)

* a. To add from Ben Philips (from Reddit post linked below in ‘Videos and comments read and reviewed for research’), “the first clip of Bob the clicking is heavier, slower and low in tone. The second clip has the clicking slightly cranked up and little faster in frequency and higher in pitch. The first clip depicts the sound of the film being pulled from a full and heavy ‘supply reel’ onto the ‘take up reel’.... the second clip tells me it’s sequentially later in the footage because the supply reel is lighter and smaller, having filled the take up reel.” Maybe the lighter reel point is correct, but the second clip also has the correct corresponding image to sound coordination and unique sound waveforms.

9) There is only one repeated blip in general shape at a later time, however not exactly the same (discussed below), and as far as I have seen no other spots, or lines in the series of videos are repeated and only last for 1 frame. This indicates natural artifacts on the original film. (7/10). If there is claims to the contrary evidence must be provided with screen captures. There are two other times that have been seen where there is a spot or line that exists in sequential frames, for example 5 sequential frames however they shift slightly in their position.

* a. People have said otherwise that the film artifacts repeat, but have not sighted any definitive examples/evidence.
* b. The one repeated spot is what I call the “duck spot” because of its shape. It appears in the UFO flying clips when viewed above the house and from the air. It appears at 00:08:46 in the ground view and 00:27:38 in the flying clip, based on the timer in the bottom left. They do not appear in the same intensity, do not appear in the same location of the film and the exact shapes are actually slightly different, especially the smaller duck to the left of the larger, one and the ground view is darker over all. If the darker spot is the earlier in the clip that would mean it could have overlaid the later spot from the flying clip, and perhaps have been stained by water or something. One would have to know the number of frames that would be wrapped around the film spool and know how far in the spool these two clips were. No way to know. If this was a digital artifact inserted, did programs at the time have this capability, and if so, further capability to slightly modify. They occur for 5 frames and so it is an unknown to me how 5 frames can have that similar pattern across them. These artifacts do not appear in any of the other clips. The presence of this artifact does not debunk the plethora of other points related to this video series. 
* c. This needs further and perhaps even a full investigation into all the film artifacts and their locations. If there is a person that exists who specializes in film artifacts this topic within this film series would greatly benefit from their expertise.  

10) There are no explicit errors in time stamp. Breaks correspond to logical time breaks. (3/10)

&amp;#x200B;

**Skinny Bob video (not necessarily in order with progression of the clip).**

**Seated clip**

1) There are [horizontal](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/60701/why-do-i-get-dark-horizontal-lines-stripes-or-bands-in-bad-lighting-with-my-fu) and rainbow-diagonal banding artifacts, I do not believe this effect was available in any editing software at the time, and to varying degrees as shown between the clips (5/10)

2) “Eyebrows” raise with corresponding eyelid movement (4/10)

3) Muscle in back of neck bulges with head raise (7/10)

4) Mouth movement open close twice and subtly (7/10)

5) Skinny Bob’s neck is thick and muscular and very likely enough to support his head size. (6/10)

6) Forehead wrinkles/lines. A level of detail to note. (5/10)

7) Shadows are consistent with lighting source in both clips. (3/10)

8) Hand movement for grasping and corresponding coordination between both hands interpreted through the shoulders. Very accurate to physics and complex movement involving many parts. (9/10)

9) Blinking is extremely natural looking and bilateral all the time. (9/10)

10) Dual eyelid, top and bottom. (6/10)

11) Skin stretch is graded from top to bottom (6/10)

12) When Bob lifts his head at the end of the clip at his collar line more neck skin appears to come out of his jacket/shirt. Could just be lighting making this look this way however. (2/10)

13) Overall complex and multifaceted body coordination and movement. (9/10)

14) Estimated that the reel to reel video was filmed with a tape (VHS) from a screen, then the tape was recorded with a digital recorder from a TV. This would have the sound from the projector included, the digital timestamp presented in the bottom, and then the scrolling “light rainbowing” artifact which then also effects the imaging of the digital timestamp. The digital timestamp might be partially covered because the year was could have been wrong and would be a distraction, therefore it was blacked out in a digital video editor before uploading to the internet. (2/10)

**Standing clip**

1) Pant crease corresponds to hip tilt. Deep level of detail. (6/10)

2) Complex hand and finger movement in both clips (9/10)

3) Right hand and arm is lower than left in standing image and corresponds correctly to stance and in order to balance the upper body over the centre of balance, the right hip in this example. This seems to be backed up by the right shoulder being lower than the left when the upper body is viewed. (8/10). 

4) Slightly shifts posture in exactly the correct way from resting on right hip. (7/10)

5) Knuckles and tendons in hands are extremely well proportioned and pronounced. Deep level of detail. (6/10)

6) Subtle eyelid movement just before blink. Extreme level of detail to include in a supposed hoax (9/10)

7) One of the few videos that show an alien not angry or scary or grossly deformed. (4/10)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to drive clip**

1) How to drive clip shows 4 points of contact on the plate that would presumably correspond to the hand placement of 4 fingers. (5/10)

&amp;#x200B;

**UFO flying clips**

1) Light or power pole look slightly diagonal as does happen when filming from a moving object and vertical objects, such as poles, are shown. This would also appear diagonally if videoing a screen projection. However the poles could also just be slightly diagonal. Interactions/oddities could be happening if/when the video was film to tape to digital. More research perhaps is needed. (2/10).

* a. Pole also has a stabilizing guy wire as commonly do power poles these days at corners and at Ts. This matches the view of the house as you view the front of the house and then side of the house in the clip indicating a turn by the vehicle. The house also stays centre to centre right of the frame indicating a turn rather than a slow fade off the right. (3/10)

2) Parallax effect from turning the corner indicates the craft was behind the house and at the distance of the “bubbly trees”, and perhaps not even moving at that time. (6/10)

* a. The overall parallax effect is all seemingly accurate with regards to the foreground and house. This of course could be an existing video with the UFO overlaid. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Crash landing**

1) These clips have been seemingly motion stabilized as shown in the top and bottom of the screen. (3/10)

2) The crash landing clips have video shake that is akin to walking movements and aligns with the camera movement. This is a deep level of detail to add if CG. Thus if practical there are many elements and cost associated to include. (6/10)

3) The standing alien (presumably Skinny Bob) is standing and his suit has similar rippling patterns, however the suit seems to be more shiny on the right shoulder and has a wider neck and in the Skinny Bob clips. Perhaps the sun being brighter causes more reflection, but the collar is definitely wider. (7/10)

4) Parallax effect in this clip is accurate, and if CG very well build. (4/10)

5) The fire/smoke from the craft seems accurate and does change, as would be expected. I do not believe CGI effects for fire and smoke in 2011 as “realistic” as shown in the video. Even though the part that does show the fire is so short. (5/10)

**Autopsy**

1) Possibly slightly motioned stabilized vertically. (2/10)

2) Like person surgeon with appropriate clothing on. (6/10)

3) Why make the last clip and basically show nothing, especially the second part with the fingers in supposed chest cavity. It would be a huge amount of time commitment and cost investment in a hoax, and only to show around 110 frames. One would be leaving so much content on the table to not show more off. (7/10)

4) The “bicep” and arm proportion is also very similar to what is shown when Skinny Bob standing. If Skinny Bob is CGI and autopsy is practical effect everything is built extremely similar between the methods. (6/10)

&amp;#x200B;

**Family Vacation**

1) The movement of the aliens in this clip are very fluid and accurate to lifelike kinetics. (8/10)

2) Lighting of the clip is consistent and from the top right. (3/10)

3) It very much looks like one of the Aliens blinks while the two are looking at each other, and again when they are facing left the one on the left looks like they blink. Deep level of detail if correct. (2/10)

4) No vertical artifact lines in this clip, as are with all the other older clips. Indicates newer technology used to record or detail added to make the “hoax” more complex. (6/10)

5) Stabilized version with some repeating parts.

* a. [https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HotCharmingIncatern-mobile.mp4](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HotCharmingIncatern-mobile.mp4)

6) Foreground and background aliens walking by. Counted 7. The foreground height of the camera approximately corresponds to a camera being held at maybe around 3.5 feet. When panned down briefly it shows legs and then back up to showing aliens in the background maybe around 15 feet away. (4/10)

* a. Very bumpy and blurry and hard to gleam much precise detail from this clip however the parallax effect seems to be accurate with regards to real world placement of the aliens. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall and specific questions surrounding the video clips.**

1) Why make all this and not take credit since 2011? Even the Santilli film was proven to be a hoax and he even was the one that promoted the video.

2) Why have the layered video (old, to film, to digital)? A lot of work to fool people unless it was necessary.

3) The budget to make all this content and places/sets, details would be very expensive. Who has that money to just spend on a hoax? Has anyone ever spent that much money on an ongoing hoax?

4) No one person could have built and filmed this series of videos, especially the flying and the autopsy. Why has no one not come forward that was involved in the supposed recent production to tell the truth?

5) Why is there a double image of the time stamps and UFO above the house, and to varying amount? Video artifact or purposeful artifact. If purposeful it is an extreme level of detail to have.

6) Who has the foresight to include, in a hoax, all the micro movements, macro movements, and details in the 7 different locations in a combination of CGI and practical effects back in 2011?

7) Why the response video defending the video content? Very layered hoax and time to make that response.

8) Why haven’t all the people that were needed to make this haven’t come forward?

aliens,"Just something i thought of recently that i thought would be interesting to hear other opinions on. 

So I know a common theory is that we started being visited once we developed nuclear bombs and started testing them. There seem to be several credible reports of sightings around nuclear weapon sites and may even seem to be gathering information and messing with what we have. So my theory is what if they ARE interested in our nuclear weapon technology/advancements and that is what brought a lot of recent(last ~100years) encounters however it is NOT the nuclear bomb that they were worried about/investigating. Maybe there is a different nuclear weapon made using similar methods/concepts that they were actually looking for we just aren’t aware or have’t made them yet. Nuclear bombs are devastating themselves but what if there is the possibility if a nuclear weapon that would not only be devastating for earth but have an impact on the entire cosmos as well and they are really trying to prevent that. All speculation obviously but just thought it was interesting maybe a lot of people are right about why they are here just maybe we arent as far “advanced” as we or they realized at first. 

Also a more “fun” secondary theory what if the aliens that visit earth are just the “troublemaker teens” sneaking out and stealing there parents ships and going on joy rides to distant planets lol. 

Also just wanted to add some other interesting things to think about but in my opinion if aliens are actually visiting us today then they have been for a majority of the lifespan of humans. Also I think that maybe in more ancient times before there was a means or as much of a need to communicate globally there could of been way more interaction then there is now. Since if they wanted to “experiment” or see how helping/hindering us in certain ways would effect us it could be more controlled of a experiment. Since now if it turned out the us government had aliens actually directly helping us it would shock the entire world. Compared to ancient civilizations where it may have only been known by that specific group. I think aliens may have helped ancient civilizations become better at what they are good at just like they might do for us some day. Like thats why we dont have artifacts of ancient egyptians having planes but we do have giant unexplainable pyramids. They didn’t have planes and didn’t necessarily need or want planes. They were obviously very intelligent and capable though but maybe just had different goals. 

Anyways that might be a lot of random rambling and might not make sense but if it does i hope it sparks some interesting conversation. Id like to hear what others thnk",Theory: Nuclear Weapons

aliens,"After reading the magic mushrooms post, I feel as though some people may be receptive to further discussion.

**Preface for those who don't know much about DMT:** 

It is found in various tree bark in nature and can be extracted and smoked. With enough vaporized and inhaled, it induces a \~15 minute period that consists of you laying down, eyes closed. This isn't the type of drug where you get up and do things, you lay down to experience this as if you are sleeping. Mike Tyson is fond of a potent form of DMT from toad venom. 

**My Experiences:** 

I have had numerous contact experiences with what appear to be intelligent entities in the ""DMT world"" after using DMT. They communicate telepathically, like airdrop for your brain. It is a strange mechanism, it feels like something the human brain is not meant for. That world is so fundamentally different (language is limiting) than ours. From the people I know, not everyone experiences encounters with entities that communicate. Some do, some have the entities but they never communicate, and for some, DMT is just a swirl of fractals and intensity. It would be interesting to gather some data to analyze for the prevalence. Among the people I know it is a toss up. 

DMT to me seems distinct than psilocybin/magic mushrooms or LSD. I have never gone to a different ""dimension"" and traversed within it on Psilocybin or LSD. The DMT world feels realer than real. Sometimes I have a body of sorts in that realm and moving within the DMT world is like moving in a dream. Other times I am simply an observer. I am inclined to believe there is some shared mechanism between dreaming and the DMT world. The way that the trip memories fade fast reminds me of how people don't remember their dreams well. 

I do not do DMT often by any means. **I'm no hippy smoking changa in the jungle, I'm just a college student at a top 5 US university in the sciences hoping to become a doctor some day**.  I have only had 4-5 entity encounters of various complexities. I have used DMT maybe 10 times. 

**Ideas and Discussion** 

I am curious to see if DMT induces neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons in the brain) in the areas described by Stanford's Dr Garry Nolan as being characteristic of encounters. 

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes)

""Between the head of the caudate and the putamen"" in the brain is where Dr. Nolan is seeing increased connection strength. DMT actually induces neurogenesis!

 This is a fascinating study from Nature in 2020 on DMT's ability to induce neurogenesis in mice:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01011-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01011-0)

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I was on DMT, the entities were trying to convey a concept about how information is encoded/transmitted. The way I parsed the communication is that ""The information is in the experience"". I am still unsure what to make of this. Upon appearing, they seemed surprised and quickly understood that **a)** I was not supposed to be there and **b)** I had a very limited window of communication. The ability to perceive entities is at the peak of this 15 minute journey, and it fades really quickly. 

Maybe it means that doing DMT transmits information via the trip? Maybe the fractals seen contain the information? What is this information? Is the neurogenesis induced by DMT like a spinning-disk hard drive, literally writing to your brain?

aliens,"I'm not against exploring possibilities and off hand discussions. But I have been getting notified of posts here for some reason, and one of the biggest misconceptions seem to be in estimations of how technologically capable an interstellar civilization capable of 10% or even 1% light speed might be. In some cases civilizations are measured by something known as the kardishev scale, it's basically a way of categorising a civilization based on the amount of energy it controls. We're a kardishev 0.7 civilization, a kardishev 1 civilization would control all the energy on the planet, kardishev 2 would be their star, and kardishev 3 would be a galaxy. We might seem to be close to a kardishev 1 civilization but the scale is logarithmic meaning linear differences are exponential, just to give it prespective every hour earth receives more solar energy than the world consumes in an entire year. If they didn't want you to find out you wouldn't, they wouldn't need to make surgical scars that you would be able to see or detect later on, they and the ships would be practically invisible to the naked eye. They wouldn't need to kidnap hundreds of humans to experiment on them, well maybe I'm wrong about that maybe they've hundreds of interesting experiment that can only be performed on one human and then they wouldn't be suitable for the second one. Just to give an example we can already grow artificial organs, they wouldn't need to collect organs and kill animals. And you wouldn't get ufo crashes. I haven't read many mythological stories but according to my perception of it by all accounts they would be more powerful than gods in ancient stories and this would just be a type one civilization. Of course all of these advancements are guesses but we can do variations and small scale versions of them now, so it's not out of the realm of possibilities. It just doesn't make sense to think a species that has travelled the stars is so un advanced in what they're doing even if they aren't careful or didn't care.

So this is something I've seen alot that I just genuinely don't fully understand the thought process behind. Typically this comes from conversations involving nihilistic misanthropes,  which are for some reason pretty common in alien discussion. Humans aren't as intelligent as aliens. We're dumb and they think we're idiots.

What the fuck does that mean? Humans aren't intelligent? In what ways? The word ""intelligence"" is a pretty broad thing that's rather hard to scale for an ENTIRE race. Is it emotional intelligence? Tactical intelligent? What type of intelligence are we lacking in so highly that alien races have apparently conquered.

To be intelligent does not require having an all knowing nature. One can still be flawed in one area of knowledge without being dumb. I am extremely bad at mathematics but that hardly makes me an idiot and if you say so I will decapitate your family.

We aren't so dumb that we cannot possibly comprehend aliens or their technologies. They're not Lovecraftian monsters that make men kill themselves just from the knowledge of their existence. They're living beings just like us and while we don't know what makes their technologies run it's not like we can't learn or atleast could understand it if were explained to us. Infact I'd argue that we are probably just as smart as them we just haven't made the same discoveries as they have yet or physically can't.

I mean let's look at humanities achievements for such an inferior species. We split the fucking atom, we completed the human genome project 18 years ago, we can clone animals, and have developed instantaneous world wide connections and have as much understanding of our own universe than any species bound to only it's home planet should. These aren't common feats that anyone can pull off. I think we'd know if dolphins had did it first.

And really what about the aliens in question through all of this? They aren't a collective hivemind people and I really doubt that the average alien is so far ahead of our people that it's not comparable. What could they possibly do that we don't? Intelligence doesn't mean anything for an alien when I could probably slight of hand pick pocket it just as easy as a human.

aliens,,Why We Should NOT Look For Aliens - The Dark Forest
aliens,"I think about this a lot lately.

When I was in the 7th grade I had a best friend that I would have sleep overs with at her house. We were only close like that for a short amount of time but in that time we had many sleep overs. The details are foggy now but I remember her telling me (before the first sleep over) that she doesn’t sleep in her room because she is scared of the aliens. I’m very much the type of person that laughs and makes jokes about anything to relieve tension. So I joked with her and told her I wanted to see too because I thought she was lying. 
At the sleep overs we would stay up late because this would only happen from 1-3 am. We would sit in her bed in the dark and wait. An orb would appear on her wall. Sometimes it was white, sometimes it was blue. It was pretty large like the size of a beach ball or even bigger. The orb would move up and down on the wall that are backs were facing when we were in her bed. We would sit there and be scared but also giggle because what the hell was going on ya know? Like I have to laugh at the awkwardness of the unknown. We assumed that light was coming from her window that faced a corn field in our Midwest town. We would tell her parents and they wouldn’t necessarily believe us but they would try to help us find answers. I remember one suggestion was that may be there was a light house that was sending light signals ?? This didn’t make sense though because although our town is on the Mississippi River, we were on the opposite side of town. There’s just no way. Her house was definetly on the outskirts of town surrounded by farm fields. We would go to school and tell our other friends and one time we had a sleep over with two other girls as well. This one was the last one because it scared us so bad. All four of us sat in her bed around 2 am and we watched two different orbs. One was basketball size and white and it just moved up and down on the wall. After awhile a second one appeared and it was tinier like the size of a baseball and it was red. The red orb went from above our heads on the wall behind us to on the bed in between our legs. Once it went on the bed, we all ran out of there. Anyway that’s all I can remember but like what do y’all think?? I have no clue what that shit was but it haunts me to this day.",11 years ago I saw orbs

aliens,"I was reading an old AMA thread that George Knapp did back in 2013 and I found one of his replies really neat. It seems to predict the current UAP/UFO slow disclosure that we currently find ourselves in. He was asked what he thought of the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure that occurred in 2013. He replied (the wall of text is how he had it formatted sorry):

""  I support the general idea of disclosure and think they had a top notch  lineup--with a few clunkers thrown into the mix. However, as I  mentioned in response to another question, I do not believe disclosure  is going to happen, now or anytime. I do believe, as J. Vallee has said,  that there is a treasure trove of UFO evidence somewhere because the  government is the one with the sensors and radar to collect such info,  but IF it still exists, it most likely has been transferred out of the  government and into private or corporate hands so that someone like me  could never find it via FOIA, or--more likely--so no one in Congress  could find it. I have been told by person who are highly placed and whom  I trust very much that a policy similar to disclosure is underway now.  it is something akin to confirmation of the basic core story. It is a  gradual, long term strategy and will not involve a sudden announcement  by the President. We have all heard rumors about this sort of thing in  years past. For the first time, I now believe something really is going  on.  I applaud S. Bassett for his commitment to the cause. as a 1st  amendment guy, I beleive in the public's right to know, but--as  mentioned--disclosure is not going to happen, not unless it is done by  another major government or by some kind of irrefutable gesture by ""the  visitors"", whoever they might be. They seem to have shown no interest in  giving us proof positive, beyond tantalizing glimpses, so ti seems like  they favor a gradual release as well. I have not met Greer but am not a  fan. Every time I get an email from him, he is asking people for money,  and it always seems like the issue of the day is about HIM, more than  the phenomena. Maybe if I had a chance to meet him face to face, I would  form a different impression. ""

Further theory leads we might be living in a neurological dream which we perceive as physical, this further relates to the simulation theory debated by scientists. It's not always technology that aliens use but mind techniques like telepathy, neurological engagement, energy waves turning into photons. 

According to abductions, aliens seem to be able to turn into a light source that can tap into our awareness. Creepy sightings that we see have a lot to do with beings hybridizing themselves into our simulation through DNA. I personally have a theory that I will save for another post. But the Pentagon connects aliens with poltergeists, lights and weird creatures. Sightings are recently increased during lockdowns for both, paranormal and UFO sightings.

Do I believe the Dark Forest theory per se? Not necessarily. I'm not entirely convinced; but I'm not counting it out, either.",Kurzgesagt Just Released a Video on The Dark Forest Theory
aliens,"I actually emailed George Knapp and asked if he had ever heard of anything similar and he emailed me back and said he hasn’t but that I should ask others if this has happened to them. So here it is. I was living in Riverside, California at the time I was around 27 years old, I fell asleep on the couch watching tv. I woke up around 3am and when I opened my eyes there was a strange star in my vision, I closed my eyes and it was still there. The only way I can explain this is like if you were to have a picture taken with a flash at nighttime and if you close your eyes after the flash you are able to see whatever was in front of you at the time of flash for a few seconds there after. Only thing is I was in a dead sleep, alone and no such flash occurred that night. And it also lasted for longer than a couple seconds. This star was unique and hard to describe. I can say it was either a 7 pointed or 6 pointed star which was elongated at the bottom( meaning the bottom points of the star were longer than the top half. I’ve never really brought this up to anyone so if anybody has had this happen before I’d love to to get answers. This has always bothered me and made me feel uneasy. I’ve thought about having my memory regressed to get answers aswell. Any ways I hope to get answers or maybe pointed in the right direction.",Waking up seeing unique star pattern
aliens,,Kurzgesagt - Why We Should NOT Look For Aliens - The Dark Forest
aliens,"So I know I just made a post on a similar topic around half an hour ago if I remember correctly, but I wanna speak about this anyway. Apparently it’s not just a fun thought experiment I randomly came up with, but an actual scientific hypothesis based around the idea of theoretical alien life. 

What if we’ve already found aliens, but rather than the government covering it all up, we simply haven’t realized or can’t see them?

#Theory 1: Cloaking
I’m not talking about high-tech sci-fi cloaking devices, but rather a mundane, common organism capable of hiding its presence from electronic devices like ROVs, radars, and satellites.

This is just an example of one sci-fi creature which evolved a way to disarm electrical devices. The Crabsquid. If you don’t know what they are, they’re a gigantic deep sea octopus-like crustacean native to the tropics of the fictional alien planet 4546B. They compete with another apex predator: the Shocker/Ampeel. And the two don’t get along. 

What the crabsquid does is it generates an EMP field to disable the Ampeel’s electric-based defense/hunting mechanism to make the bulky fish an easier target.

What if life on Mars has evolved something similar for a similar reason? A cloaking device to hide from electronic/radar based predators. Think of how a shark like the hammerhead senses electric pulses to help track down prey. Now combine that with deep sea animals such as the big red jellyfish, vampire squid, and several species of whalefish and toadfish. Since red light doesn’t reach that far down into the sea, the red coloring makes them practically invisible to most predators. Of course there’s species like the loosejaw and barreleye which have evolved counters to this strategy, but overall it’s an incredibly effective cloaking device.

What if alien life isn’t on the visible color spectrum, or has evolved to avoid detection from electronic devices? Most of Mars’ water is groundwater, so it’s likely if the planet has any complex life it would be underground. And radar-like vision would very much assist a subterranean predator.

Anyway Reddit is having a stroke from how much I’m typing (I’m wondering how tf horror writers put up with this) so imma cut this short.",What if aliens are just straight up invisible?

aliens,"With the creation of the Galileo project and the passing of NDAA and the UFOx task force stuff. I think that the DOD knows that there is absolutely no way out. They've been mated, and they know they'll 100% lose, the only question is will it be in 2 or 5 moves. DOD will try to prolong the process, but eventually the previously mentioned organisations will give us undeniable proof. And that proof will be the information Lue Elizondo uncovered during his tenure in AATIP. One among many things the DOD fears is their deeds from 1947-1980 being made public, so what we'll hear is that the discovery of aliens happened in 2007. There was no Roswell, no one was assasinated, no UFOs were reverse engineered, we only found out about it when AATIP started investigating things, there were no aliens or signs of aliens before AATIP. We'll only get the HD pictures and videos Lue gathered with AATIP, that's the only way the DOD is willing to lose.

The self hate thing bothers me the most but it's also just a nonsense notion that a space/time fairing species wouldn't be very interested in studying and experimenting with any intelligent life it comes across.

aliens,"I was reading [this article about the Stanford scientist studying UAP materials](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nzkq/stanford-professor-garry-nolan-analyzing-anomalous-materials-from-ufo-crashes?utm_source=reddit.com) and really enjoyed the straight to the point perspectives by the professor. 

However while reading it, he mentioned a certain Dr. Kit Green, and Vice links to [this article](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9382232/leaked-memo-suggests-fake-roswell-alien-autopsy-video-real-cia-scientist-pentagon-briefing/). I am not a believer of what theSun posts but what gave this some credence for me:

1. The Stanford Professor Garry Nolan mentions Dr. Kit Green
   1. ""He was in charge of studying some of these individuals. You have a smorgasbord of patients, some of whom had heard weird noises buzzing in their head, got sick, etc. A reasonable subset of them had claimed to have seen UAPs and some claimed to be close to things that got them sick....That was when we realized that these people were not damaged, but had an over-connection of neurons between the head of the **caudate** and the **putamen**..the putamen influences motor planning, learning, and execution."" Why I am ***mentioning the neural stuff*** here, will become clear at the end of the writing. 
2. Vice links this particular article; there can be a few reasons

* This is the most apprehensive article on the subject of Dr. Kit Green + the memo + video , all in one -- so it made it easier for the writer to show everything with one link
* I am guessing Vice interviewer checked with Professor Nolan and he said yes that summarizes well
* I don't know, the above two bullet points can be wrong, but I am taking the Vice article as well written, the Professor credulous, hence the Sun link = less salt

I read the article and in it there is a mention of the memo, the Sun article has two pages of it, but here is [the full one.](https://pointblank.company/memorandum.pdf)

* It's basically a summary of points by Dr. Kit Green from Eric Davis to Bigelow and cced Colm Kelleher (Colm is mentioned in the Vice article) + emails
* The summary goes deep into the professional thoughts of Dr. Kit Green re: the alien autopsy video 
* Here is a link to the [full autopsy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukbzCC3cfQ), I am sure all of you have seen this
* I had seen this as well and in my mind always dismissed it as fake, but never watched it to the end, where there are ibeams shown as well, which is crazy cool 
* Basically Dr. Kit Green says that the video is legit
* You will find lots of debunking of it, but it seems it was done after the fact and the original guy that released it, Santilli, just stopped giving a two after years of harassment and went silent. 

I also researched the areas that Dr. Green mentioned were missing in the brain, or different from human anatomy:

1. No Corpus Callosum -- This is an area that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. Lack of this in humans is known as **Agenesis** of corpus callosum, which results in epilepsy, retardation, or can be mild and go unnoticed, also ""Some patients may have deep-set eyes and a prominent forehead. An abnormally small head (microcephaly), or sometimes an unusually **large head** (macrocephaly), may be present.""
2. No Sylvian Fissure -- is essentially a deep layer within the brain that separates the frontal lobe and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe. It's functions are ""allow\[ing\] for continued growth, overall increasing brain function.,"" ... ""speech production and speech recognition were organized as a kind of two-lane, two-way highway around the Sylvian fissure. ""**Damage** above the Sylvian fissure, in the parietal and frontal lobes, tended to cause speech production deficits; damage below the Sylvian fissure, in the temporal lobe, tended to cause speech recognition deficits. These results provide new evidence that the cortex around the Sylvian fissure houses separable neural specializations for speech recognition and production.
3. No Temporal Lobe -- ""The function of the temporal lobe centers around auditory stimuli, memory, and emotion."" **Damage** to the temporal lobe(s) can cause ""difficulty placing words or pictures into categories. Language can be affected by temporal lobe damage. Left temporal lesions disturb recognition of words. Right temporal damage can cause a loss of inhibition of talking.""
4. No Occipital Lobe -- vision center. Lack of this does necessarily indicate no vision, it can mean maybe ""[Color agnosia](https://www.flintrehab.com/agnosia/) is similar to normal color blindness. Except whereas color blindness affects color *perception*, color agnosia affects color *knowledge*."" -- This can explain the lenses on the [eyes at 10:23](https://youtu.be/pukbzCC3cfQ?t=623), you can see the ""physicians"" removing it from the eyes.
5. No Vernix -- ""Babies without vernix might have drier skin than others.""  Not sure if this is the reference here. There is an area in the brain called **Wernicke's** Area, which is responsible for ""It is located in the temporal lobe on the left side of the brain and is responsible for the comprehension of speech."" ""When this area of the brain is **damaged**, a disorder known as Wernicke's aphasia can result, with the person being able to speak in phrases that sound fluent yet lack meaning.""
6. No Cerebellum -- ""The cerebellum (“little brain”) is a structure that is **located at the back of the brain** Although the cerebellum accounts for approximately 10% of the brain's volume, it contains over 50% of the total number of neurons in the brain.""... ""It helps coordinate motion and ensures that you remain balanced and controlled in daily life. When the motor cortex in your cerebrum tells part of your body to move, the cerebellum makes sure that motion happens in the right way.""... ""Even though the cerebellum has so many neurons and takes up so much space, it is possible to survive without it, and a few people have. There are nine known cases of cerebellar agenesis, a condition where this structure never develops....People with cerebellar agenesis are clumsy. Most can walk (though they may need a cane), but fine motor skills like writing, typing, and speaking are a challenge. Their speech is never quite perfect and their handwriting is always a bit off."" This might explain why the alien has six fingers, maybe for better coordination: offshoot speculation; take this with insane amounts of grains of salticles.
7. No Medulla Oblongata -- ""The medulla oblongata plays a critical role in transmitting signals between the spinal cord and the higher parts of the brain and in controlling autonomic activities, such as heartbeat and respiration"" ... and apparently ""**life cannot be sustained without the work of the medulla oblongata**."" .. this might explain why the **heart**, as mentioned in the [memo](https://pointblank.company/memorandum.pdf) (page 6), as ""a single contiguous non-muscular vessel through the heart"" ... my guess is that since there is less regulation of it from the brain, thats why its a single vessel vs the five vessels in a human heart. Just from my brief 2 min search from google, I have no idea on biology.
8. No Rugae -- the ridges on the brain. I am not sure what the lack of this constitutes. 

It's peculiar that Professor Nolan (stanford) mentions Kit Green and studied these areas from the MRIs of  brains of injured/innate people. I am taking a leap of faith and drawing a conclusion that there is a correlation between the lack of areas in the alien brain and the hyper availability of **caudate** and the **putamen of the ""in contact""** people. Also, maybe the lack of emotions as observed from our perspective of emotions might also be due to their inherent brain structure. (Super late as I am writing this, will reread tomorrow and see if what I wrote makes sense)/

Also, ibeams at the end of the video as mentioned in the Roswell crash, had not seen that before. 

Anyways, thought to share my train of thoughts, hopefully leads to some insight. 

***TL;DR -- was not a believer in the alien autopsy video but reading the vice article about Stanford professor researching uap material went on a rabbit hole to discover dr. kit green's analysis of the video and seems legit.***","Stanford Professor UAP analysis, Dr. Kit Green, alien autopsy video, lack of brain areas in aliens, what that can mean."

These mutations are, from my understanding, a viruses ability to adapt and change to survive.

These changes are then stored and programmed (similar to computers) and passed along as the spread continues. Does that action not constitute intelligence?

aliens,"We got the term flying saucer from a report in 1947.  Since then, we have had countless eye witnesses state that they have seen flying saucers.  The problem, however, is that the original witness in 1947 did not describe flying saucers or disc shaped craft.  He described flying wing like craft what flew like saucers skipping across the water.  Prior to this incident, people had mostly only see lights, and odd craft, but never much described as a disc, saucer, plate, or even a bowl.  

Fairies are in a similar position.  There are no shortage of accounts over the past century of people seeing beings straight out of a children's book or Disney cartoon.  The problem is that the popular image of fairies was almost entirely invented in the 19th century and popularized in works of fiction.  The hundreds of years worth of faerie lore that predates it bares little to no resemblance to the popular representations seen today.  

So now the uncomfortable part.  Seeing as how in both instances, the most common descriptions given after a specific form is popularized line up with that image, despite the image being a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the original concept, how many of these reports are simply made up?  How many are people's brains filling in blanks of an otherwise mundane occurrence, based on their own biases toward certain imagery?  

There is still room for the strange, however, as it has been suggested that perhaps the things that people see are not what they seem to be, but rather present or otherwise imprint themselves in a way that the target will find acceptable.  People of the 1800s saw airships.  Then they saw strange lights and aircraft, until people who only read headlines spread the idea of literal flying saucers.  Likewise, for centuries, there were a wide variety of strange seemingly otherworldly entities engaging in disturbingly similar behaviors, but today it is pretty much a handful of alien races, and ""cartoon"" fairies.  

Fairies take it a step further, however, as almost all of the disturbing behavior has been transferred over to alien beings, right down to paralyzing wands, bright rooms with no light sources, asynchronous time passage, an interest in reproduction, passing through solid objects, and vanishing in and out of plain sight.   Most winged fairy sightings that I have seen these days tend to lean toward the bizarre or are just brief sightings of a small ""winged humanoid.""  So it is interesting to see how, despite faerie lore being almost completely divorced from modern fairies, the concepts present in old fae encounters have continued under a completely different label.  

That said, I think it is important to understand that while that may be the case, that it is also very common for people to lie for attention, for a variety of reasons, some for greed, and others for loneliness or illness.  I feel it is important to remind ourselves when spending time and energy looking into topics like this that we have to be vigilant and not just take everything at face value.",Flying Saucers and Fairies.

aliens,"Hey y'all, I've been posting this in various places and thought here might be a good place to post. Would love to hear your opinions. Originally posted on a message board so apologies for the green text format.

[here's the image I reference below](https://iili.io/78kXP2.jpg)

&gt;Around 10 y/o
&gt;Playing out back with my friend
&gt;He's like 13 at the time
&gt;We are on our Razor scooters having a blast
&gt;Have an idea
&gt;Want to make a figure-8 for some dumb kid reasons 
&gt;Make pic related figure-8 with the scooters on my parents driveway for no real reason other than for fun
&gt;My friend is the red line, he went around in circles (his direction could have been reversed but I believe it was counterclockwise)
&gt;I was the blue line

Before I continue I want to add that directly below the picture (so this would be the bottom of the square in pic related) there was an alley. Across the alley there were around 4-5 boys from next door playing basketball. They were close to our age.

&gt;We start to do the figure-8
&gt;The boys across the alley are being loud and yelling (normal kid stuff)
&gt;As I (the blue line) make my final circle in the figure-8 I see one of the boys shoot the basketball
&gt;When I hit the middle of the figure-8 I stop (now facing up on pic related, toward the garage)
&gt;My friend stops as well on the right side of pic related just at the edge of the square
&gt;Waiting to hear the basketball drop from the hoop
&gt;Hear nothing
&gt;Turn around
&gt;The kids across the street are gone
&gt;The whole block is very quiet
&gt;I turn to my friend and ask him if I'm retarded or if there were kids playing basketball literally 5 seconds ago
&gt;He turns around and starts freaking out when he realizes they're gone
&gt;We both question our sanity and are genuinely shocked. Neither of us have experienced this before.
&gt;Talk for a couple of minutes making sure we knew FOR SURE that the guys next door were playing hoops
&gt;Feel so shaken that we go next door and knock
&gt;The kids mom answers
&gt;""Hey, weird question, but were the boys outside playing basketball a few minutes ago?""
&gt;She responds: ""Oh they left like 30-45 minutes ago, they went to the corner store.""

aliens,"They advanced far beyond the other animals, much as humans have among mammals, and left when the extinction event occurred. Now they're back and have found Earth populated by a new type of sentient creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

First. I wonder what's more likely, hyper-advanced beings develop twice, on the same planet, despite being part of a different animal class, or, that a species of even more advanced beings created both us, and our current advanced avian visitors. This is a possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, despite the possibility of a master race, master of the green/grey avian visitors, and us, this might explain why people say they have 'bases' under the oceans. They learned their lesson the first time not to build too much on the surface, as it's too vulnerable relatively speaking and might be why they seem to have little interest in invading and/or using our dry land. 

&amp;#x200B;

It might explain why they are such advanced experts in flight, why the ancients worshiped birds such as the Egyptian ultimate Sun god Ra (in some way showing respect to their birdlike alien visitors possibly), or in movies, such as the Owl in 'The Fourth Kind'. 

&amp;#x200B;

They seem to keep their distance just as birds do and are rarely ever seen on the ground, maybe for a brief moment for it takes off once again, like a bird. They even seem to act like birds, just as humans in some ways act like 'apes'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think what might fascinate them most about humans is the fact that we are sentient, and our culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

Culture is what is unique, it's in part what makes us mammals, and it's also in part what makes us humans. If there is one thing we have that they don't, it's our culture. Our food, movies, music, behaviors, reactions, everything, that they are probably quite interested in, but much like birds they might be fundamentally predatorial just a bit, but that doesn't necessarily mean evil and dangerous, and it's our relatively calm temperament that also probably fascinates them to some degree (being mammals).

aliens,"Reasons. Every thing in universe has a reason there is a reason for you reading this right now, may be you are bored. There is a reason for us to go to work everyday. If something happens with out any reason then we call it accident. In my opinion accident can also be considered as reason. So , why they (others, aliens,spirits,greys or whatever they are)why do what they do. What are reasons. There can be many species of them.i'm not going to analyse every species of them. I'm taking worst possible scenario,that is existance of worse possible evil omnipotent and super intelligent entity and going to analyse it(NOTE:  i'm not saying it exists,just analysing why it is being so evil if it exists).why so many wars, why so many conflicts in world?
I mean if it is omnipotent why all this drama,when it can simply create its own cities,bars,amusement parks and all the pleasures that exist in world. 

So reasons can be,


1.Bored
2.Lonely and uncertain
3.lack of freedom and limitations
4.Multiple intelligences and races
5.Artificial intelligence or bunch of rules
6.accident
7.something we cannot comprehend
8.full freedom 

1.i don't think it's boared. I mean it can literally do a lot of things, can't it stop the feeling of boredom by any other means then being so evil .(still there is possibility) 

2.lonely. if its lonely why being so violent.when there are million otherthings
(Still there is possibility) 

3.lack of freedom, i personally think it is most likely. Where there is no freedom there conflicts rises. If you have complete freedom in life, why go to work when you can create own money. Why eat when you can survive without it. Why need car when you can fly. You can be god. Why this drama.(still there can be other possibilities). 

4.Multiple races and intelligences some good,some bad and some with own agenda. Some may trying mess things. while others protecting for own reasons.(might be) 

5.AI or bunch of systems managing things.
Like some bug or glitch or  programme might have gone rogue in simulation(well if simulation exists). That just doing its thing. 

6. May be we are accident and everything might not have an reason. Everything maybe just circumstance. 

7.some thing we cannot comprehend. 

8.Full freedom, may be everything exists some good, some bad, some dumb ,some AI, some interdimensional and some extraterrestrial.Some of might be omni potent and omni powerfull. So what happens when two equally powerfull guys with different agendas fight. They don't get along. Its like giving guns to chimp. Unlimited power without law and order can be dangerous. Before we arrived, they might have messed up things. Thus, may be this drama. 

Conclusion.
There are 6 basic behaviours in psychology
1.Personnel.example ego.
2.Motivational.
3.Developmental.
4Genetic.
5.Unconscious.
6.Social.
Its definitely not genetic, Unconscious.
Its mostly not motivational, personnel because i don't see any motives behind it.
Maybe social
I personnaly think its developmental behaviour that this beings are showing.(well if they are real). It is behaviour seen when someone tries to develop something(like birds gathering saplings to built nest).But why develop world in this harsh way unless you have strong reason or limitations. 

But i don't see any other good reason other than 3,4
(3.lack of freedom and limitation.
4.multiple races and intelligences)
Either way it is likely we got messed (well again, this is only if they exists &amp; omnipotent &amp; evil).
I understand why lue said sombre. 

(Well again its all just speculation of possible existence of most evil and most potent being ruling us. Take it with a grain of salt).
Limitations are very dangerous and
I think Freedom is most important thing.
If they god, aliens, interdimensional, higher beings who ever they are that are watching or governing us and even are benevolent,If they don't have complete Freedom and god like access. It is highly likely we are messed up.

Maybe humans are slower to get it done cause at the end of the day, we're all a bunch of lazy asses.

In whichever hypotheses shows  to be true in the  end extraterrestrial or inter-dimensional beings being true. The conclusion in the end is that the mind is much more important and  powerful than we thought. 

If Interdimensional Being are true , than somehow our consciousness is in that extra dimension. 

 If extraterrestrial exist and we are  hybrids of a species able to communicate with the mind, our mind is  thereof a intergalactic tool. able to telepathically communicate with other beings.

aliens,"This happened to me a little over a year ago, but I haven't shared it with many people because of how insane I felt at the time. But I figured this community may have some insight on what happened to me because well, it's safe to say it's been a very.... interesting year since this.

So, I'm a hedonist; I enjoy baths. I'm chilling (partially reclined) in the water when suddenly the most bizarre feeling comes over me that's hard to describe. It's like I subconsciously knew I was about to black out, so I grabbed hold of the shower curtain so I didn't sink underwater, and then everything went dark.

I felt intense vibrations through my body, and then felt myself 'lift' out of myself. My vision was limited, and saw only brief flashes of imagery flooding my thoughts. The most clear thing I managed to see, or what made its way into my vision, was a blue skinned, reassuring looking being wearing white clerical robes, reaching their hands out to me. Looked like what I guess some people might categorize as an Arcturian? I ended up drawing my own artistic interpretation of what I saw [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHo0xu2Dorz/?utm_medium=copy_link). There was what felt like a flow of energy throughout what I suppose was my astral body, before the sensations faded and I went back into body.

I had no idea what the fuck actually happened to me, or how much time had passed, but when I came to I felt very... refreshed almost? Like this ET gave me a quick soul cleanse before peacing out? The only way I could describe the sensation, overall, is that my mind/soul/astral/etheric body was taken out, blown into like an N64 cartridge, and then put back in.

I did get pretty freaked out though later though, wondering if I'd had a seizure and was hallucinating or something. It was a mental state unlike any other one I've been in. Pleasant yet bizarre. 

Now that I've learned a bit more, I've realized that was probably an OBE (and I can see how that can overlap with epileptic disorders as well). Even if this was all in my head, it felt significant.

Can anyone offer some insight on this experience? Did I get abducted in the astral to get a quick purification? Or was I just blacking out in the bath while hallucinating vividly lol. My mind likes to say ""both"", but that's just me being open to whatever's possible I guess.",My first OBE was also what I believe to be an encounter

The author went on to explain that the many supernatural occurrences within the Bible were in fact extraterrestrial encounters. The angels, the flying scrolls, flying pillars, shields, humanoid beings etc. 
The ancient authors who wrote the Bible lacked the proper vocabulary to explain the phenomenons. The original Bible was also written in Hebrew not English, so when it was translated that could have twisted even more words. The space age also did not exist until hundreds of years after the Bible was written, so words like ufos or extraterrestrial not existing in the Bible would make sense.

About 3 or 4 weeks ago I had some kind of vivid dream about being in contact with aliens. It was such an intense dream/experience that it haunted me for days afterwards and I couldn't stop thinking about it and was questioning whether it was just a dream or something more.
But here's the weird thing. I know that I pored over the details of this dream for days, trying to analyze it. That much I clearly remember.

2. water planet. Finishers/ biologists seed it with organic life, and fine-tune it for evolution and colonization. Going to need to create the seeds for lots of fossil fuel to help the colonies.

4. Post-humanoid planets. Alien engineers begin work on a highly sophisticated and technological planet after successful colonization and stock-piling of necessary raw materials. Maybe there are a few humans still left to operate mines and factories.
5. Finished products. The engineers have completed their assignment and hand over the product to their leaders higher up in the administrative hierarchy. The creator is the top dog of that hierarchy.

I'm not here to argue or debate whether you think this is a real or fake experience. I want opinions, as to how this ""lifeform"" could function. This could be life, not as we know it. Or, it could be some technology being controlled by life. Either or, *I want your explanation to how you think this thing works.*

I did a lot of searching and have found other people including another person on reddit in my same city with the same exact experience.

I was in bed with my girlfriend. I woke up in the middle of the night to a ""black mass"" spread out like a sheet inches away from my face. It was spread out over both of us, over a king size bed. I instantly launched my arm at it to point at it, in a state of shock. The part I pointed at, instantly avoided my hand. It was at this point, it started consolidating, moving up towards the ceiling. I shook my girlfriend up and told her to look. I noticed that she sat up and froze, staring at it with me. It moved slowly. It look like a unique state of matter. Like a fluid / dense gas like appearance. It did not appear like ""smoke"" and seemed to have some type of ""membrane."" It was very dark, but still transparent. In some places it was more thin, in some places more dense, it just depended on how it moved around. I remember seeing a faint, dim orange glow in one part of it. It moved up to the ceiling, spreading itself out, like an octopus. A appendage formed out of itself, like it was reaching out, and the rest of it followed that part and it seemingly slipped through into the vent and vanished.
 
This was in South Texas and it happened many years ago. I asked my girlfriend what she saw, without telling her anything, and she described exactly what I saw. Other people have seen this exact thing. In fact ""black masses"" have been reported for a long time.

You don't have to believe this and I'm not here to debate. I only want your explanation of if this was life, what do you propose it might be made of?

 It kept up with the plane but once my brain fully kicked in and I called my sister to look it pulled straight back and slowed down to the rear of the plane and then I lost it. 

No one on the plane mentioned it so Im not sure if anyone else noticed it.

aliens,,The Remarkable UFO Encounter Incident by British Policeman Alan Godfrey
aliens,"Do you believe in light and darkness? Well you can see it. There is also a God and a Devil. It's the laws of physics, not religion. Basically humans are on the earth in a temporary matrix test to see if they do good or bad things when nobody is looking. Upon death we go to the sun where God and all those who have died live. I had an out of body experience and can confirm that the light at the end of the tunnel is the sun. I got carried back to my body and went in it. So basically Aliens have souls like humans. They just use technology to latch their soul onto a body. We are born but they are created. So Aliens know what happens on death. Murderers and bad people go to the sun to get judged. God will cast off dark people from the sun because they go against the synergy of everyone else there. So Aliens are trying to help as many people as possible get to the sun, aka heaven. But because people reject whats right, and the earth is being destroyed by people, the Aliens will eventually be told by God to reset civilization. Its the same concept as the cows who refuse to believe there is a slaughterhouse. People refuse to believe in a higher intelligence than the human race. Thats why Aliens are banned from revealing themselves. We are not ready. Most people don't use telepathy, aka praying. There are also opposing races fighting for their flock of people. An area 51 for every superpower country. Eventually they will have to fight over resources. But they have been keeping us from using ICBM's and preventing a nuclear war. So now every major Alien race working with its country has a select group of citizens on a list that they will abduct to save in the event known as Armageddon. When the battle between extraterrestrials over control of the earth begins. Thats why in the Bible it talks about judgement day and the rapture. The Alien ships will show up and blast their horns. In the last days the Trump will sound. Letting everyone know that it's judgement day. People will get lifted up and saved. While the surface of the earth will be reset. Aliens will literally use lasers to melt everything to obsidian. Including billions of good people. They do it fast enough that its painless. Burning everything. It happened 6,000 years ago according to some people. Basically judgement day is when the Aliens decide to fight. They keep it a secret from each other more than from the public. Aliens don't want other Aliens to find their secret entrances under the ocean. They have bases. Oh and another thing. The universe is full of life. Every sun is full of intelligent people living in synergy. Aka heaven. So the whole point of your life is to make your own choices whether you will go to heaven or hell. Its' your choice. It doesn't matter what religion you are in. The laws of physics apply to everyone. All men are created equal according to George Washington. So when you generate dark energy with your actions you are seperating your soul from the light, slowly. This life is the only middle ground. The sun and black holes are extreme energy forces. And we are the balance between them, set up to filter the good from the bad. So the Aliens will kill the people because they are using the planet to make a better society than before. And they understand it's not murder because they got the orders from God on the sun to enact judgement day. That's why you see video's of ships the size of earth siphoning energy from the sun. They are Gods. And we are trapped here because we are all lower intelligence fighting each other.",The Alien Agenda is God's agenda

aliens,"As I often get ask how to connect to the galactics, I will now share with you a few protocols, given to us by the Galactic Confederation and brought to us via the speaker of the Resistance Movement. If you want to try them, I'd ask you to keep an open mind and simply let go into this experience not expecting too much. It really depends on how much you are willing to actually believe in it as this will determine the level of your openness and receptivity.

**These are the Commands:**

\- ""Command 12 21"" (Calling your Personal Team)

\- ""Command 771"" (Emotional Healing)

\- ""Command PB Stardust"" (Easing Chronic Pain)

Ofcourse you dont really need protocols to connect to them, but they can truly enhance your experience and help you with specific things. So I'd recommend for all serious Lightworkers - if you feel so guided - to ask for your personal team (“Command 12 21”) and use the one for emotional healing (“Command 771”) as often as you feel like it and whenever you want support working through emotions in your ascension process.

I can imagine, that part of your “personal team” will be soul family of yours (if not exclusively so) and also that it may even be the same team who can support you with emotional healing when using “Command 771”. When I use one of these Protocols, I feel instantly comforted and held by them.. 💖

✨ Please share with us your experiences! I'm curious about your feedback :) ✨

**Command 12 21 (Calling your Personal Team):**

*“A special Surface Task Force has been formed on the motherships of the Light Forces, with global teams working on the planetary energy grid, and personal teams working on assisting the individual Lightworkers and Lightwarriors, monitoring and evaluating their development and preparing them for Contact.*

*If you wish a personal team to be formed for you and assist you, you need to say the following protocol aloud three times: “Command 12 21” (pronounced command twelve twenty-one). The first time you say this, a personal team will be formed, and each time you invoke the protocol after that, your personal team will check your status and help whenever and however they can.”*

**Command 771 (Emotional Healing):**

""*Pleiadians have communicated that they have finally developed a protocol for emotional healing. If you wish to receive emotional healing from the Pleiadians, you need to repeat three times “Command 771”, and Pleiadian medical ships will assist you with their healing beams. It helps to lay down and allow 20-30 minutes for the healing process.""*

**Command PB Stardust (Easing Chronic Pain):**

""*The Pleiadians would now like to help people with chronic pain and have developed a protocol that can help ease the pain. If you have chronic physical pain, you can repeat three times in your mind.*

*“Command PB stardust”*

*The Pleiadians will then use their advanced technologies to access your central nervous system to ease your pain. This new protocol is still in development and is limited in its efficiency and the Pleiadians are asking for feedback. Those who will use this protocol, are welcome to report its effects in the comment section on my blog where this article is posted.*

*Command PB Stardust Pleiadian protocol for removal of chronic pain has been proven to be about 80% effective. Main factors reducing the effectivity of the protocol are suppressed guilt, suppressed negative emotions, past life soul contracts with the dark forces and extremely complex and / or strong medical conditions.*

*You need to understand that this protocol in most cases does not heal the cause of the pain, it just adjusts the central nervous system so that is decreases the pain signal. Moderate pain signal is then simply a sign that something is wrong with the physical body and medical attention is needed. This protocol is NOT a substitute for medical intervention by conventional and / or alternative medicine.*

*The Light forces have requested that this protocol gets viral as it has the power to drastically reduce the amount of unnecessary suffering on the surface of the planet.""*

And a lot of people think both are real at the same time. Aliens existing. Yeah, sure I can see that being legit. It's a big universe after all.

 But aliens traveling to Earth for hundreds or even thousands of years is insane. And hard to rip my mind around. If you ignore Hollywood movies and early eras civilians' descriptions of a UFO for a second. Aliens traveling to Earth in 2017 for the first time ever would still be far-fetched. But in 2017 or later years, the traveling would still be more believable than hundreds or thousands of years.


There are a lot of factors I can't even bring up here. Too many to bring up. For starters, the universe is too big. It would take the alien race actually thousands or 100 years to even get here in 2017, 2021, or 2022 in the first place lol.

On October 21, 1978, Frederick Valentich, a 20-year-old Australian pilot was flying from Moorabbin to King Island, the trip was supposed to be with his fiance but she couldn't get away from work early and never made it in time. 

At approximately 45 minutes into his flight, Valentich reported to ground control that he could see an unidentified object that was flying faster and higher than he was. 

Ground control in Melbourne confirmed that they knew of no other aircraft in the area and that nothing was showing up on the radar. 

Valentich described four lights, that looked like landing lights on the object and that it was long and metallic in appearance. 

Shortly after a signal disturbance appeared to happen between him and ground control and communication was lost, that was the last time anyone heard from Valentich. 

The full story with audio recording is in the link above.

Sandia is the engineering arm of the U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise. We weaponize the nuclear explosive package to create an effective and sustainable nuclear deterrent.

The nation's nuclear weapons must always work when commanded and authorized by the president of the United States, and must never detonate otherwise. Nuclear weapons must survive extremely complex and often harsh environments. They may remain dormant for decades, yet must be immediately available during high alert/readiness levels.

These highly complex technical challenges require a multi-disciplinary approach of systems engineering supported by deep science.

Sandia’s foundation is science-based engineering, in which fundamental science, computer models, and unique experimental facilities come together so researchers can understand, predict, and verify weapon systems performance.

1. Why was the head of Air Material Command (based at Wright-Patterson Airfield) in New Mexico in early July 1947? Twining was at Sandia Base to attend a course regarding atomic weapons, as the airfield was home to the 509th Composite Unit. (Fact Vs Fiction Pg. 134) 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Why was Twining fielding questions from reporters, per the Oregoner article? The commanding officer of Roswell up to 8 July 1947 was lower ranked - William H. Blanchard, who at the time was a Colonel. (Fact Vs Fiction Pg. 165). Twining was told to STFU by Brigadier General Roger Ramey, head of the Eighth Army Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, who quickly pronounced it a misidentified weather balloon. Unusual for a Brigadier to countermand a Lt. General? It was probably coming from Lt General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Deputy Commander in Chief of the Air Staff. Following the division of the United States Department of War into the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, Vandenberg was designated the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on October 1, 1947, and promoted to the rank of full General.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Col. Blanchard ""goes on leave"" on 8 July 1947, replaced as Commander Roswell Army Airfield by Lt. Colonel Payne Jennings. (Fact Vs Fiction, pg 105).

&amp;#x200B;

3. Page 5 of CIC/IPU says Vandenberg limited comms from airbases. Interestingly, this report was re-classified in 1960 by the authority of Allen Dulles - the ""Top Secret"" part is crossed out and the word ""MAJIC"" is stamped across it - indicating the MAJIC classification is either above top secret or in an entirely different classification altogether (like an Atomic Energy Commission classification because of the propulsion system?). The dissemination limiting marker, ""Ultra"", remains intact though.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Major Jesse Marcel was in the Intelligence cell at Roswell Field in July 1947. Major Sheridan Cavitt (later Lt. Col.) was in the Counter-Intelligence cell at Roswell but didn't report to Blanchard. He reported to 700 CIC in Bolling, Colorado, and was taking orders from them about the incident. (Fact Vs Fiction pg. 165).

&amp;#x200B;

5. Fact Vs Fiction report page 134 has the order sending Twining to the 509th and is dated June 1947. The same document also has Vandenberg's appointment diary for June 7, 8, 9, 10 which chronologically lists all of Vandenberg's meetings and phone calls during that time. Includes call from Col. Hackett from Oregon, as detailed by the Oregonian newspaper article. (pg 145).

&amp;#x200B;

6. Fact Vs Fiction pgs 145-147 also lists several meetings/phone calls with Stuart Symington, who at the time was Assistant Secretary of War for Air. On September 18, 1947, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force was created and Symington became the first secretary. Symington had a stormy term as he worked to win respect for the United States Air Force, which previously had been part of the Army. He had numerous public battles with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Symington is an interesting figure - a close friend of John F. Kennedy. The CIC/IPU report pages 5 and 6 details that the Counter Intelligence Corps learned that Congressman John F. Kennedy was leaked information about Roswell from someone in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force - most likely Symington himself.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. The key thing here is that if any ONE of the Majestic Documents turns out to be real, they are ALL likely to be real. The massive can of worms this then opens up therefore is that the Burned Memo will also likely be authentic - meaning a group of unelected government officials successfully organized the assignation of the President of the United States to keep the truth from the general public.**

aliens,"If you look at how quickly the closeness of man and machine has developed in the last 10 years, it's interesting to imagine where that will lead. 10, or even 50 years is not a long time. And even now, most need their smartphone on the toilet, they get lost in their own town, or need instructions on basic life skills through youtube. It's safe to imagine this is only the beginning with integrated microchips under the skin and robotic prosthetics. 

In a mere 200 years, we can easily speculate that if humanity somehow survives, it will be completely reliant on technology, microchips that monitor every fascet our bodies and minds to ""advance"" our lifestyles, everything connected to other users through a network of moderators that ensure the political and medical side of things. But what if that is still the beginning foundation?

What about in another 1000-3000 years? It's already apparent that machines can read our thoughts and emotions, that's the direction we're going. Who's to say we're not morpthing into something very different with the addition of machine learning? And literally, almost anything could be implemented under the guise of the ""betterment"" of humanity. I don't see much of a fight against it after the next few generations die off. 

I wouldn't be surprised if what we're seeing is a race of beings that have outright shelved their biological bodies after eons. Their minds and personalities could be uploaded to cloud storage and connected to machines that can travel the galaxy without the challenges that biological bodies present. Now, what would that look like? It could look like a glob of plasma energy that can travel near the speed of light with integrated technology that isn't solid, but conscious. Seems insane, but park an SR71 on the lawn of the top university in the 1800s, allow the best minds in the world a crack at it. They wouldn't be able to even start the process of figuring it out. That's a mere 60-year gap in technology, so imagine another 1000. There's also the possibility that they could be millions of years ahead, which would seem godlike.

But I wonder, is this just the beginning of what most intelligent civilizations eventually face? At some point, wouldn't it be safe to assume that machine technology would advance the species beyond what biological ever could? My point is, whatever we're seeing, might not be anything like the biological structure they used to be.",Could the smartphone be the foundation for what we're seeing in our skies?

Actually being transdimensional suggests near instantaneous 'travel'. Therefore travel by rocket power from some place a million light years away would be meaningless.   

 If astral projection is a real thing that a few humans do then a civilization a million years ahead of us should be adept at it and it seems able to return to a solid physical state once they reach their destination. We know that from solid recovered craft and bodies.  So it could be a blend of psychic ability and Newtonian and quantum physics that they use.  A better guess for me is that being so far evolved they don't even live on planets but exist in some other way and can just drop in and then take on physical form.",Transdimensional

aliens,"To be clear, I believe many of the experiences people report to have with these beings are 100% physically real. They're not delusions.

However,  there's definitely a psychological aspect to these encounters, and I feel the different alien races represent different parts of our subconscious mind that our conscious mind may knowingly (or unknowingly) be grappling with. They represent our greatest hopes and fears for ourselves, and they're the ones running the show in the background, projecting our innermost desires into physical existence.

Consider:

* A  seemingly angelic race of Nordic (""Tall White"") aliens that preaches spiritual development. Fun fact: Eisenhower apparently turned down a deal with these guys in favor of working with the Reptilians and Greys, who promised more military technology.
* A  tall, muscular, intimidating race of ""Reptilian"" aliens that secretly lives under the Earth, regularly works with the US military, and abducts/rapes women. They're said to be psychically powerful and give off a ""sexual"" energy. By far the most intriguing and terrifying race at first thought.
* A sort of asexual, physically atrophied, short, skinny, homogeneous race called ""The Greys"" with giant, black eyes on a perpetually expressionless face. Also has advanced technology and abducts humans. **People who encounter The Greys often report that they are the future collective form of humanity, a dying, hive mind race that's unable to reproduce and thus must take from our gene pool in order to keep their race alive.** Yikes.

It's interesting -- you never really hear much about the Pleiadian *people* or Reptilian *people*, it's generally encounters with individuals from different species. What are they up to?

aliens,,Albert Rosales 1000BC - 2007 HUMANOID REPORTS
aliens,"I wanted to outline what the word ""skeptic"" means to me because to me the meaning has nothing to do with disproving something or assuming nothing interesting is going on.

The skeptical mindset is not about rejecting things nor does it entail reaching some tipping point where you are ""convinced"" and then stop being a skeptic. It's also not a matter of being closed minded. For a skeptic, open mindedness means that you give ideas a **fair** evaluation, which means that everything is subjected to the same kinds of tests. However when something pseudoscientific or unreasonable is presented and does not pass these tests, it means it has not passed a fair evaluation that is up to the same standard that everything else has to pass for you to take it seriously. That's what a fair skeptical evaluation should look like, and what it often does.

Now to explain the title: why am I a ""skeptical UFO believer""? Well I am a UFO believer because I believe there are unidentified flying objects in our atmosphere. I also think it's very possible that some of them could be alien crafts: if most civilisations generally keep quiet, the galaxy all around us might be colonised but we are not able to detect it, and alien visitor crafts would not be an unthinkable occurrence. Some might just be cruising by and someone could even have seen one and made a report of such. 

The skeptical part however is important because presently we do not have any way to tell which, if any, of the reports thus far have actually represented a genuine alien craft visiting the earth: that's why I am skeptical, because I am always open to new evidence, but when the real evidence arrives, I expect it to hold up to a battery of skeptical evaluations and essentially survive unscathed. Because then we will be able to tell for sure rather than potentially getting fooled by fake evidence. 

It's important to hold a high standard of evidence for this because here is a fact that is often obfuscated and denied, because it doesn't sound good: we do know that liars and intentional hoaxers exist in the world, and they have operated inside the UFO community before. We also know crazy people do actually exist and sometimes report crazy UFO occurrences but it's ultimately nothing but a figment of their imaginations.

We also know sometimes people are wrong and fail to identify objects that are not actually aliens, such as hundreds of aviators every year who misidentify the planet Venus as a UFO because it can look like it is moving when it is really bright and near the horizon, and the landscape shifts relative to the plane and the sky. This parallax illusion doesn't indicate pilot incompetence, it's just a human error that can happen to anyone depending on the situation.

Also lots of people simply misidentify planes, satellites, drones and balloons all the time. It happens with anything from a big Mr Peanut balloon to a bunch of mylar balloons tied together that get misidentified as ""shape shifting UFOs"" because they jostle around in a big cluster. Likely way more than 99% of UFO sightings are the result of misidentification of some mundane object. Most UFOs just remain UFOs because there is simply low information about them and they will never be resolved because they consist mostly of a story or maybe if you are lucky a bad video that shows nothing, or something that claims to be amazing footage but with zero context or information about its provenance so it's impossible to tell it apart from the thousands of other CGI hoaxes out there. In fact many proven hoaxes still get recirculated, showing how much easier it is to make a mess with bad information than it is to clean up with good information.

And further it must be noted that even large groups of extremely well trained, highly educated, competent, decorated and intelligent individuals armed with the most sophisticated equipment on the planet, can sometimes simply be wrong. You might recall reports about the ""[Faster-Than-Light neutrino anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly)"" back in 2011 that came from the OPERA experiment at CERN. Well it turns out that after months of many scientists and engineers thoroughly scouring through all the systems and data, the observation was found to be flawed because it was the result of an improperly plugged fiber optic cable and a timer difference between 2 facilities involved. 

So: we know for a fact that sometimes mistakes happen, and liars and crazy people actually do exist. Meanwhile we have 0 evidence of unambiguous evidence of alien visitations. 

As such there is a very good prior reason to be skeptical about any such report, *specially* if you care about getting the actual evidence when it actually arises. 

Thus being a skeptical believer seems to be the right way to go about things: I believe in the fact that people do see objects in the sky that they can't identify and I want to get to the bottom of this issue. However I'm open minded to all sorts of solutions, including multiple solutions for different cases. In some cases they might be very interesting solutions, such as plasma phenomena in the atmosphere, or in select cases perhaps alien visitations. But in other cases, probably a majority of cases, the solution might be simpler, such as being a result of misperception or the limits of the reporter's observing capabilities making it difficult for them to identify an otherwise mundane object, or in some cases even mass hysteria or psychogenic illness such as in the case of ""Havana Syndrome"". I'm not going to deny that such explanations might turn out to be true just because I really want the aliens to finally arise: I do, but that might not be necessary as an explanation for many such cases. If that's the right explanation for a case, you don't want to miss it, even if it's not as fantastic as aliens. At minimum it should tell you it's not as fantastically unlikely as aliens being the explanation for any given incident. 

Similarly, some of the sightings might be the result of actual human advanced or secret technology, whether our own or a foreign adversary. Perhaps some of the sightings represent Chinese or Russian drones that are violating our airspace in some unauthorized manner. Those are real possibilities and they also merit investigation. More importantly, we do know that such technologies could exist and aren't beyond the reach of humans, so they are more realistic possible explanations that deserve more attention than, for example, the possibility that it could be aliens. That still means it could be aliens but that's overwhelmingly unlikely to be the right explanation on average in any given instance: there are just too many other possibilities that are not just plausible but actually are confirmed to have happened multiple times already, if not straight up being totally frequent occurrences. If one of those explanations is the right one, you don't want to miss it. 

Often skeptics are accused of being unable to see the ""big picture"", which means the narrative painted for the ETI hypothesis from various individual incidents, because they delve into the details of those individual cases too much for the overall narrative to continue to make sense. But my opinion is that the big picture is formed from little pixels: if the components of the picture are wrong, the big picture won't be what it should be. Perhaps there is no big picture and sometimes we connect events that really have no relation to each other. 

So each case should be individually, fairly evaluated for ALL possible explanations. If and when the right explanation is aliens, that will be the best fit. But it's because I can value that process in its entirety that I find it most reasonable to be a skeptical UFO believer.

aliens,"**Hi,** 

So I was asked to elaborate on this; on them. I’ve met them a few times, I feel like it’s been a lot more, but there are only a few I consciously remember. I will preface this with A-regardless of their intentions, they are bastards, and B-I have told pieces of these stories on other accounts years ago, but not all in one place. I don’t care if people believe me or not, I’ve given up on finding out ‘the truth’ a long time ago.

The first time I was 11 or 12, (6th grade). I went to bed like normal for a school night, but it was hot so I had my window open. We lived in a ranch style house, so all of the windows were only a few feet off the ground. I had my bed on the opposite wall from the window. I was woken up by what sounded like radio static and blue and yellow lights, (bright enough to wake me), but my brain assumed the neighbors were throwing a party (In the middle of the night on a weekday…), and I tried to go back to sleep. I woke up again sometime later, it was dark again but I saw to my right, standing next to my bed, a ‘gray’ alien. It was facing towards my feet and I assume it must have noticed that I was awake, it turned to face me.  

It was fucking horrifying. It didn’t move like regular things move, it was like, stiff and jittery. It couldn’t have been more than 2 feet away from my face. It was probably about 3 1/2 feet tall (based on how tall my bed was), and it’s features were not ‘rounded’ like how TV and movies makes them appear more ‘real’, organic, or even slimey. It was sharp and angular. Dry, pale, and just unnaturally artificial looking. It’s face was 2/3rds big black eyes, and had no discernible nose, and a tiny slit for a mouth. It wasn’t actually gray, and it was dark, but it was more of a light caramel color.

There are only a few pictures floating around that look like what I saw, [one of them is this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/97cd9f6f8c9d83963361ca3bdd705bea/tumblr_oideyo8lHt1ujgi1qo1_1280.jpg). Whitley Streibers [Communion book cover](https://www.amazon.com/Communion-Story-Whitley-Strieber-1988-02-01/dp/B01NH0M6TG/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&amp;keywords=communion&amp;qid=1632944511&amp;sr=8-14) is very close too. (I don’t think it’s meant to be a stylized representation, but rather that is exactly what they look like. Unnatural and 'sharp'.)

As soon as it turned to face me, I crossed my legs (so my feet weren’t exposed), and threw my blankets over my head. I was covered head to toe. Then I started praying to every god I could think of to protect me and to make it go away. Jesus, Buddha, etc. I wasn’t raised religious, and am not now, but I didn’t know what else to do. I stayed there, sweating under those blankets, praying, barely able to breathe until I could see daylight through my covers.  

I don’t know how long I stayed like that but I know it didn’t get light until around 6:30am, (which is when I needed to get ready for school). I slept with my head under the covers and my bedroom lights on for years after.  

I didn’t tell anyone about that for a long time, but I did start to research the subject, and I read stuff like the Time Life Mysteries books and I tried to read Chariots of the gods, (unsuccessfully).  Within six months to a year after that I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  I don't think they are related, other than most people that get T1 have some kind of traumatic event that coincides with their diagnosis.  

The next time I met them I found myself waking up, sitting cross legged on the floor in my kitchen. This was a different house, (still a ranch and only a few miles away from the old one). Sitting across from me, about two feet away, was Helen Hunt. (!). 

I was groggy but could move my arms and speak freely. The regular kitchen lights were on and everything felt really… nice? Copacetic. I said, ‘You don’t really look like this, do you?’

She told me, ‘No, we thought this would be more pleasant for you.’ I couldn’t tell you what she sounded like, and I don’t really remember her actually speaking. But she ‘said’ these things to me. I say she looked like Helen Hunt, but I don’t actually remember Helen Hunt being there. Just an impression of her? I couldn’t focus on her nose or mouth and have a clear picture of her. I just knew, hey, this is the pretty blonde lady from TV. (This was in the 90s BTW).  

I felt very safe, and comfortable with her. I got very loving, nurturing vibes. Until I looked around the edge of my kitchen wall, (the living room was visible from the kitchen), I could see a reclining chair we had in our living room, and I saw one of the big eyed scary ones peeking out from the side. I felt very cold, mean feelings from it. I asked her what his deal was?

She said, ‘don’t mind them, they’re just jealous’. (I might be paraphrasing there, but that’s the gist of what she said.).  I always thought that was an odd answer and assumed it was a language barrier/understanding thing. I am aware of all the bullshit about abductees being told they are special etc, and maybe it was something like that. Like they tell us that so we’re more accepting of the circumstances. Either way, I don’t trust a word they say. 

I know we spoke about more but I don’t remember what. I woke back up in my bedroom a few hours later.

I’ve thought about what if these were just dreams or sleep paralysis. But I could move fine each time, and I was awake. I remember these just as well as I remember anything else that happens to me, maybe even more because it was so odd and eventful.

The next time I saw them face to face, I was about 18-19 years old.  

I still lived in the same place I was at during the previous incident, I was still sleeping with my lights on and my head under the covers. I woke up with my head uncovered, but the light was still on, there were several ‘aliens’ in my room having what looked like a mock party. It was bright and they looked like fuzzy blue muppets, dancing and bouncing around. kind of similar to Grover from Sesame Street, only smaller. It looked super fake and patronizing to me, so I said, ‘I don’t believe this, this isn’t what you look like.’

Then the room suddenly got dark and was filled with blue light. I heard them say ‘we were trying to make this easier for you but thats not going to happen now.’ They peeled back the muppet faces to expose the big eyed scary alien faces. I remember these guys were smaller than the other ones I’ve seen. They looked the same but they were more pale white, but it could’ve been the rooms lighting.  

Then a big alien came out of my closet. (My closet door was already open, he could have just been standing there the whole time). He glided over to me, I was still laying in bed, but now I was crying, because this shit was terrifying. This guy was tall, 6 feet at least, very thin and white. Big head and black eyes. He cradled my head with one hand. I don’t remember his hand feeling weird or how many fingers or anything. He turned my head to look directly at him. (I was scared and didn’t want to make eye contact.) I heard him say, (without moving his mouth), ‘you’re not ready.’  He was very stern and, unfriendly.  Very, very scary to look into the face.  Fuck.

Then it was like a snap; I woke up in bed, in the exact same position, lights on, with tears dried to my face. I jumped out of bed and searched my room; no one was there.  

That was the last time I saw them face to face. I’ve lived in apartments since where I’ve thought they were around late at night. I’ve woken up at 3am and searched my house/closets but I’ve never found anything. I’ve woken up screaming several times, but never remember why I was screaming.  

I’ve been in therapy for years. I’ve had hypnosis and EMDR done for this. All of my therapists agree I have some kind of PTSD, that something happened to me. I can’t say if it was real space creatures in my house or not. I don’t even think that’s what they really are. (I think they try hard to give us that impression.) Something happened, but I don’t know what. I used to want to know, but the older I get, I realize I’ll never know and I’m starting to accept that.

In the hypnosis, the only thing I got from it was an alien ‘woman’ in a red dress that I felt safe with as a little kid, being outside in the snow barefoot in pajamas, being in a white hospital room alone as a toddler and having a toy with owl faces on it, and that they’ve been around a lot more that just the 3 incidents I remember. But no real answers, or reason why.  

I can assume if they went though the effort to try to make it pleasant for me, maybe they don’t have bad intentions? Or maybe that just makes their job easier? (Using good bait to catch a fish…). They’ve never really told me anything, no real answers, no anything except for what I wrote here. This is why I don’t trust them, also creeping into little kids bedrooms at night?  What the fuck.  If you want to talk to me, hell, if you want biological samples, knock on my door and ask.  I wouldn't be so inclined to respond with violence now, (pretty sure if I saw one now I would try to kill it), if it was a more open and honest process.  

I’m not as afraid as I was in my older age. I have kids (adult kids now), and they’ve never shown signs of them messing with my family. I have security cameras around my house; I’ve never caught anything. I think they don’t mess with me anymore. (I hope it stays that way).  

Occasionally I have dreams about them. It’s never obvious stuff that makes me think they were in my house again, but weird stuff, like here’s a river, how would you catch a fish? Then it resets again and I have to try to catch a fish with a spear, then it loops again until I end up breaking the dream logic and I wake up. Sometimes I see them in my dreams disguised as people. I’ve been chased by them in dreams too.  

But these are clearly dreams, much different than the other memories I have. So, I don’t  know.  I don't think we're really ever going to get disclosure. I don’t think the government’s of the world really know much more than we do, (besides playing with found technology and maybe dead bodies).  

If it comes out that I’m wrong, and we do find out the US governments been keeping this a secret/colluding, I’m probably going to sue the shit out of the government. This has been a lifelong problem for me, and even now, as I’m less paranoid about it, I still think about it 100 times a day. I still look around corners at night and I still check my security cameras at 3am. It’s exhausting.",Lifelong problems because of contact

This goes all the way back to Project Stargate's claims of spying on Soviets with remote viewing (the subject of the book and film the Men Who Stare at Goats, Putoff was one of Uri Gellar's strongest proponents). Although Stargate and other paranormal programs were officially shut down in the 90's, Bigelow managed to convince Senator Harry Reid to fund a new version of the program in 2007 called AWSAP/AATIP. Congress realized Reid slipped the line item in and let AATIP run out of funds.

What's the big deal about a bunch of quacks in the military intelligence industrial complex chasing flying saucers? Well, they seem to have used the the UAP investigation narrative as a foot in the door to fund ""investigations"" into the other pseudoscientific views that they hold. This includes things like quantum consciousness, non-physical beings, poltergeists, cryptids, ESP, the whole paranormal kitchen sink. 

Essentally, these guys used government funds to support and promote their personal paranormal projects and views about the nature of reality, which is getting awfully close to using taxpayer money to fund religion. Imagine if the Department of the Interior funded a study into how witches and demons affected crop yields. My worry is that by leading the charge in getting UAP investigated they are going to accrue a whole lot more credibility within the government and the population than they are qualified to hold. Most chilling are comments they have made in the past about the efficacy of the scientific method in uncovering reality. Elizondo in particular claims the UAP phenomenon isn't a scientific issue but an ""intelligence issue"". He and his backers have actually claimed that the paranormal is precognitive and resists efforts to record it or measure it scientifically, which begs the question of what they need to spend the money on if they can't study it. This precognitive intelligence they go on about sounds an awful lot like a deity and they are beginning to sound an awful lot like priests interpreting ""its"" will.""

I didn't realize he was such a proponent of the fake alien invasion hypothesis. He asserts that all of the people involved in this recent mainstream UFO disclosure, Elizondo, Mellon etc. are all disinformation agents, and completely 'in-the-know' when it comes to black budget projects and human-ET technology. 

Greer has been knocked down a few pegs lately, having allegedly faked a CE5 encounter with flares. ([WP article](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/did-steven-greer-fake-a-ufo-with-flares)) Then again, I'm not 100% sure I believe the article, as Greer has probably pissed off quite a few people, some may or not own and operate the Washington Post... It's a tossup for me.  But considering his efforts of the last 25-30 years, I still respect him and appreciate his thoughts. I'm not going to believe everything he says, but I can entertain his ideas. 

So has the disclosure movement been hijacked by the conspirators? He doesn't offer any compelling evidence in the video. It's mostly accusations that come across very emotionally charged. 

Surely it's a possibility though, maybe not the same extent that Greer claims, but one would think that IF an elite cabal with advanced ET tech existed, they would be capable of pulling these strings. 

I'm just going to suspend all judgement and wait. If the narrative goes toward hostile invaders, it will be pretty obvious pretty soon here.

aliens,"In this post I will share all the evidence I have gathered so far. I'm not sure how good the evidence is.

Probably not coincidental:

* The Great Pyramid points to true north with 0.06% error and the other corners point to the other cardinal points with similar accuracy.

* The Pyramid of the Sun and surrounding landmarks form an accurate model of the solar system. One issue is that this model [requires cherry picking of landmarks](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/the-teotihuacan-solar-system-revisited) and there are many landmarks to choose from. Nevertheless, the four original terraces of the Pyramid of the Sun would still be an accurate model for Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

* Pi and phi (golden ratio) are incorporated into the geometry of the Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of the Sun: [source](tenochtitlan).

  * The height of the Great Pyramid divided by the perimeter is approximately 2pi and accurate to a few decimal places. Most sources indicate that the value of pi would have been discovered some time after the Great Pyramid was built.

  * The height of the Pyramid of the Sun divided by the perimeter is approximately 4pi and only off by 0.025%: [source](https://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/Reynolds.html).

  * The slant height of the Great Pyramid divided by the base of the triangle it forms with the base of the pyramid is approximately phi, and is accurate to a few decimal places.

  * The slant height of the Pyramid of the Sun divided by the base of the triangle it forms with the base of the pyramid is approximately 1/phi.

* The names of the three pyramids of Giza are Mykerinos, Chephren, and Cheops. Cheops is the Great Pyramid. These three pyramids may correspond to Mercury, Venus, and Earth, since [their positions would reflect the orbits of those planets](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Correlation-between-the-inner-three-planets-of-our-solar-system-and-the-three-pyramids-of_fig14_279852699). [There are some other relationships between the pyramids that also reflect relationships between Mercury, Venus, and Earth](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Correlation-between-the-inner-three-planets-of-our-solar-system-and-the-three-pyramids-of_fig14_279852699):
  * The volume of Cheops divided by the volume of Chephren is nearly equal to the volume of the Earth divided by the volume of Venus.
  * The base length of Cheops divided by the base length of Mykerinos is almost equal to the aphelion distance of Earth divided by the aphelion distance of Mercury.
  * The base length of Cheops divided by the speed of light is almost equal to the volume of Earth divided by the volume of the Sun.

Maybe coincidental:

* [Orion correlation theory:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_correlation_theory) The three largest pyramids of Giza may have been a map of the Orion belt which first appeared in the night sky in 10000 bc. According to the wikipedia article, the position of the pyramids does not line up well enough with the Orion belt. I haven't been able to figure out if they really do line up with the Orion belt or not. The Pyramid of the Sun has a similar placement in relation to the other two main pyramids in Tenochtitlan.

* The coordinates with the same numbers as the speed of light is about 8m away from the apex of the Great Pyramid, but accounting for continental drift, the coordinates would be only 1 meter away from the apex in 10000 bc and potentially closer than that.

* The perimeters of the Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of the Sun only differ by 3% whether you divide the perimeter of the Great Pyramid by the Pyramid of the Sun or the other way around.

Very likely coincidental:

* The weight of the Great Pyramid multiplied by 10^8 is roughly the mass of Earth.

* The length of the base of the Great Pyramid is 1/43200^th of the Earth's diameter, and the height of the Great Pyramid is 1/43200^th of the polar radius of Earth. 43200 is quite arbitrary but it is the number of seconds in half an Earth day, and the significance of half a day would be dividing the day into daytime and nighttime.

Debunked:

* The Great Pyramid is located at the geographical center of the Earth. This was calculated using an inaccurate map of the Earth in the 1800s. Though I haven't seen anyone do a calculation using a map of the Earth from 10000 bc.

Also, we still don't know how the Egyptians cut and moved 2.5 ton rocks around, especially in the vertical direction, so that's a form of evidence.

“Greetings. We are the Arcturian Council. We are pleased to connect with all of you.


We are so very capable of seeing the patterns as they emerge on your world, and right now we can see that the patterns are indicating a greater awareness of your place within the galactic community, especially amongst those who have been non-believers in extra-terrestrials for their entire lives. The way their newfound beliefs manifest is in their willingness to investigate, their willingness to go further than they have ever gone before with a sense of curiosity about who or what else exists in this universe. 



Skepticism is healthy to a certain degree, because it allows you to tap in to your discernment abilities, which you need, but when someone is skeptical without ever questioning their skepticism, that’s when you know there is something larger at play within the individual that needs to be uncovered. And that is also happening; people are questioning why they believe what they believe and why they don’t believe in certain things that others believe in, and that is a positive step forward for the collective consciousness of humanity. You do need to question everything in order to examine it fully and draw your own conclusions. 


You were never meant to align yourself with one set of beliefs from the day you were capable of having a belief and adhere to those for the rest of your lives. That would be quite limiting and it is something you are moving past at this time. Of course, there have been humans who have done this, and there are humans who are doing it right now, and these are the humans who are awakening. Everyone has to start from somewhere, and so you have there on your world much more evidence of the existence of extra-terrestrial life and consciousness than you have ever had before.



It doesn’t take much nowadays to make someone into a believer, and that is a critical first step. There does, however, need to be a second step after that. People then need to understand that e.t.s are not to be feared. They are not to be feared just as no aspect of yourself should be feared. You are there to have your initial reactions, but then ultimately to embrace everything and everyone, including the unseen, including the e.t.s who have yet to make themselves know to the vast majority of humans there on Earth. 


And that next step is coming for so many who have begun to open themselves up to the possibility that life beyond Earth does in fact exist. This is a huge step forward for the human collective and a huge step toward joining the galactic community, officially, which is something you will do and you will do soon. Just be patient with your fellow humans; they have chosen a different path than you have, but it is still a valid one. It is still one that needed to exist.

aliens,,Disclosure- 2021
aliens,"This assumption seems pretty clear based off of the “Admiral Wilson” memo. Wilson is a former Director the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Being the director means that he has detailed knowledge of ALL of the black programs that the U.S. taxpayer funds. Yes, the director of the DIA has more knowledge about these programs than ANY modern day President has. Wilson noticed that there were a few black projects that he could not access and that was unheard of for him since he has complete oversight of them. He went and requested a meeting with a scientist who was a part of these projects and was denied access to the SAP, due to not having a need to know. He threatened to label them as rogue programs thus killing any contracts swearing the people who are working on them to secrecy, meaning they could speak about what was going on without any repercussions. The scientists then said he could tell him If that was the case, but it had to be off the record. 



I’m 90% sure that at this point in time, the people who have control of alien tech. are not under any control by the main US government. These SAP’s were granted by a former President (idk who it was) and when that President left office, the SAP’s basically black listed any future President from knowing about these programs by requiring a “need to know”.


The easiest way that I can explain this is these programs were known about by the elected officials who allowed them to be created, but when those officials left power, the programs took control of who gets to know and basically became their own thing, free of government oversight, but they still get to keep taking tax payer money. 

The people who have this tech don’t answer to anyone and that should make everyone concerned.","The DOD, Pentagon and President(s) of the U.S. do not have any knowledge of theSpecial Access Programs (SAP’s) that have alien tech. They genuinely do not know what the UFO’s are or where they come from."
aliens,"If they're so advanced, they probably view us as inferior species, as far as those beings/things are concerned, we're not equal. 

We might be merely NPC's in their universe, to the advanced aliens, we don't have equal rights at best, we're insignificant at worst, which means the implications are never in our favor (for better or worse) as the sole masters of our own planet. To ensure the survival of our species, we must act like our immune cells, when potential threat is detected, our immune system doesn't let a foreign pathogen hang around and monitor it's behavior before finally making a decision.

Although the idea of directly learning alien tech from those beings sounds amazing, I don't think it will happen anytime soon, because as species we haven't evolved passed our archaic instincts and territorial tendencies. We're basically apes with smartphones. Which is fine, I believe humanity as a collective, is capable of overcoming any challenges in the future despite our shortcomings, and we don't really need an alien assistance for that. We've been doing just fine for thousands of years, all things considered...

They're not our friends, and should never be viewed as such, since we don't understand their psychology, let alone their motives.

aliens,"So after reading thousands of stories on both the topics of aliens and ""spirituality""... it seems to me  what's going on is that spirituality may be the ""ultimate technology"" while aliens are simply just futuristic (or different) versions of ""us"" (as main products of this simulation).  It all starts with relativity... the rate of time changes as gravity and velocity change.  Time proceeds slower with increased velocity but faster in a stronger gravitational field... which seems to tell me we're living in a created ""simulation"" (since time can proceed quicker or slower depending upon variables).  So this simulation may be what's responsible for ghosts, NDE's, the 6th sense, etc... we may have evolved in this simulation to the humans we are today (possibly with the help of aliens if the briefing is correct that Bob Lazar read).  So this simulation may have achieved millions of different species throughout our universe (possibly with different dimensions) and could be responsible for all the variety of relatively intelligent aliens such as the greys, tall whites, ""bigfoot"", reptilians, cryptids, etc. that are believed to exist elsewhere in our universe. And so it may be that we, as the main product of this simulation (along with any other intelligent aliens), have been given access to ""spirituality"".  i.e. Bigfoot may not only be more intelligent than us but also spiritual.  I don't mean to push any religious view as I was raised with nothing said about religion and am a life-long agnostic... but there's no ignoring the other side of it all (whether that's aliens or spirituality)...  and many people do want to ignore the other side.  I can't. So are UFOs just aliens traversing by warping space-time (as Bob Lazar describes) in this created simulation that has given us (and the aliens) ""spirituality""?","Aliens vs ""spirituality"".... two differing levels of technology?"

aliens,"I know that in general, when people tend to hear the word UFOs or anything related to that topic they disregard it as bogus. I understand where they are coming from because I tend to be the same way. With all the conspiracies, fake claims, videos and things like that surrounding the topic its hard to take it seriously. Unless it’s verified or comes from a source that I consider reliable. I’m not in the loop when it comes to UFOs. I find the concept of UFOs/Aliens interesting but that was about it, never really paid much attention to it. 

Until recently… When the Pentagon came out and disclosed some information about them. Now I feel a little different about, I think that there must be some kind of intelligent life out there. I don’t know what they look like or whether they are organic,multidimensional, inorganic, etc. I don’t know if I’ll ever know. 
Now with all the reliable evidence that is being presented to the public in the past couple days, it’s hard to ignore or disregard as nonsense and has changed the way I look at the idea of there being intelligent life in the universe besides us.

I’m kind of puzzled as to why the media hasn’t talked about this very much. I feel that the Pentagon must have good evidence to come out and address this topic publicly. They’re a reliable source of information, so I don’t understand why is that this topic doesn’t have a lot of coverage.",Why there isn’t a greater coverage of UAPs in the mainstream media lately?

aliens,"Sorry if this is obvious and has already been talked about, but I'm not well-read when it comes to the alien subject.

If for years, governments across the globe has hidden the existence of aliens from us, whatever those reasons may be, why do you think they are now preparing us for the revelation of their existence? I've seen arguments that we have better technology available to all people that make it easier for us to detect UFOs, therefore making it harder for governments to continue denying they're real, and that the world is going through a transformative stage spiritually and mentally which means humanity is at a point where we can accept the truth that life exists outside our planet. There's other arguments too, but for me they all don't give a good enough answer as to *why now?* Governments have done just fine continuing to deny the existence of aliens and any form of visitation, they could still continue to deny everything and get away with it because, as I'm sure most of you can testify, the majority of people have no idea about what's going on and will believe anything governments tell us. They could suppress people like Lue Elizondo and Jeremy Corbell and things can be business as usual. So why are they allowing greater transparency and seem to be allowing for disclosure to take place now? Why change tactics now and allow people from presidents to the homeless know of the existence of aliens? 

Maybe their hand is being forced. Maybe this isn't a case of having a change of heart, but they know something is coming and need to prepare us for it now before it takes place. Whether you believe u/throwawayalien and their revelation that aliens are going to descend from the skies on July 8th or 18th 2021, whether you think aliens are going to reveal themselves to us at some point, I truly believe this is why we're being conditioned to accept UFOs and the existence of aliens. These beings have made a decision, communicated that decision to world governments, and those in charge are powerless to stop them and change their mind. I don't know if they have a game plan as to how they'll maintain power once aliens arrive or whether they know their reign of control is coming to an end (because shit will be crazy for a while and humanity will likely turn to these beings for answers, rejecting world leaders). If an alien race(s) are coming to earth, this would explain in no uncertain terms as to why disclosure is underway.

Of course, this is all speculation, all stuff just knocking around in the ol' noggin'. Please, tear me apart in the comments, I'll happily read everything as I want to understand more about what is going on and *why* it's going on.",Why do you think disclosure is supposedly coming this year?

aliens,"I've come to the tentative conclusion that the UFO phenomena is \*something\* -- as in it is not concocted by crackpots (even if crackpots exist in the field), and people are witnessing a physical (even if ethereal) thing/event that is unexplained by human technology or physical nature as we understand it

Given the a priori common sense of the Drake equation, we can logically deduce life exists elsewhere in the universe. I'll digress slightly -- because \*perhaps\*, this is an appeal to scale or large numbers. There is a paper that lays out such an argument (that I have not read yet) that would be worth reading -- at least for objectivity's sake: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/188351?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/188351?seq=1)

With that out of the way, even though there does seem to be progress in terms of governments 'coming clean' so to speak, with regard to this phenomena, I don't quite understand the tendency to ""wait for disclosure"" -- as if only the state can confirm or deny the existence of something unexplainable or unknown. This is very poor thinking, and makes no sense. Consider waiting for the government to conclude the earth is round or that it revolves around the sun or that there are 7 continents or that electricity is a a thing we can benefit from. Absurd. Pretty much all of the knowledge we benefit or enjoy today has come from people and the discoveries they have brought to the rest of us -- usually through market mechanisms. If we relied on governments to tell us what was true or not, we'd likely still be in the stone ages, and in some places, where the governments control information, they indeed are in the dark ages, at least

I do understand most people's worldview consists of the delusional belief tax funded government agents are supposed to be working for the tax payers, and therefore they should disclose what they know -- but of course this is naive, and while this paradigm is wide spread, it is inaccurate as to how things actually are. Tax funded agents operate out of their own self interests just as anyone else does, and the mechanisms we, as peon tax victims, have to force their hand are next to pissing against the wind. The government (the United States or any other) has never told the truth and likely never will. They have no incentive to do so. Understanding this would bring anyone to the conclusion that it is completely unreasonable to expect governments to not conceal and or lie. And of course, the history is filled with governments doing just that -- despite the romanticism some have over state military and republicanism

So, we're left with what? We have our ability to act -- to affect our own ends, of course

So...

If we believe some \*thing\* is here that is either

a) from another planet

b) some kind of interdimensional and ancient earthly intelligence

c) ethereal and angelic/demonic entity

then why would we not organize ourselves in order to ""make contact""? What holds us back? Nothing besides organization. If I had a say, I would certainly suggest we organize. If the phenomena has any mal-intent or is neutral to our safety, then perhaps large numbers are a safe way to proceed

If we are curious enough, then there is no good reason not to organize, and attempt to make contact with whatever in the hell these things are

Waiting for government lords to tell us what they know is foolish and naive -- and it will likely never happen in full given the actual relationship between the people the government rules over and the government itself

So I say let's organize an effort to reach out to these things -- whatever these things are","Why wait for disclosure? Summon the phenomenon, and see what happens ourselves"

If you are human, crocodile guy, lobster sprite guy, fish guy, owl guy, or anything else at all, we are all related and we are all brothers and sisters. WE all come from THIS particular universe. We are not from other dimensions. It is they who are from other dimensions. Spinning at different speeds than us. When you travel through time, you are not traveling through time. You are going to another dimension when you run into a soft spot like those you know of such as the Bermuda triangle effect. The Bermuda triangle effect of something disappearing means the plane or boat hit a soft spot and went to another dimension. These spots are all over the planet and they can be tracked. Do not use them. 

So the crocodile guys are not aliens. They are just guys. The only problem I see is they want to eat us. So we need to work on that. And they are really dum too. Other than that they are cool guys, bro. 

The owl people are pretty cool too but they are from another dimension. So. They are from the future. In the distant future, the surface of this planet gets taken over by giant owls who are highly intelligent and have language and they have small hands too. So if you find a soft spot that sends you what seems to be into the future, you will be seeing what will eventually happen in our dimension. Which is owl guys.

This all happened about a little under a year ago, a couple of weeks before Christmas. A friend and I had decided to drop a tab of LSD (I'm not sure how many micrograms, although you can never be sure) and go see a Christmas light show after we made it through the come-up. 

Afterward, we roamed before stopping at a park we often smoked at that we called the ""duck pond"". For reference, the park is on the edge of a fine line between suburbia and bluegrass horse country. In the center of the park is a small lake with a road that runs all around it. There are two exits, one leading towards a neighborhood and one out towards the country roads.

We arrived at the park around 2 AM, give or take about eight hours into the trip. The visuals had tapered off and were not noticeable by this point. We both exited the car with hoodies to shield us from the frozen winds blowing across the water. Both of us were excited to get out of the car, stretch, and look at the frozen-over piles of half-melted snow with the strange sort of ""night vision"" LSD can give you due to pupil dilation. We had parked near the boat ramp for the lake, our usual smoke spot, which had an adjacent cement dock with a few tables that we made a B-line for after we got our bearings. We wanted to be out on the pitch-black water.

Standing on the corner of the dock and focusing on the rippling water that merges into the treeline and night sky, I appreciated the perfect silence. Then realized it was too quiet. I thought about the bleak environment, bare trees with no bird song, and cold hard dirt without paws or bugs. In theory, we were the only creatures dumb enough to be wandering around such a harsh place. The thoughts passed as we stood on the tables and got bored of the dock. As we started to mosey on back to the car I noticed a strange light.

This appeared to me at first as two distinct points of yellowish starlight, two lightning arcs connected the points as they moved from a distance closer towards us. They moved slowly with intention. I shrugged it off. I had tripped before and was able to roll with the strange things I saw. *It's probably a plane*, I thought, *there's a shipping hub in the nearest city and we get planes overhead all the time*. I kept the sight to myself but also kept my eye on it. My friend looked up and stood still staring at the lights. They seemed to be dropping from the sky and descending straight towards us now.

""Do you see that?"" they said, not looking away. I confirmed and we both stared with a growing sense of unease. Something about looking at the apparition was deeply unsettling. We started to debate about the best course of action: Running back to the car or standing our ground to see if the lights really were just a plane. We lasted up until the points of light became the front lights of a triangle-shaped silhouette now hovering 400 feet in the air on the other side of the lake.

We went back to the car laughing and deciding it was not worth it to risk probing while tripping. they drove as I kept staring out the front windshield in disbelief. The object looked like a snub-nose compact version of the [Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk). Two white lights shone out the front while a tiny red light blinked from one wing and a blue light blinked from the other. These lights blinked from the top of the object. I noticed a yellow light-emitting out the bottom. The silhouette had become the vague shape of an object and was eyecatching in the cloudless sky and bright moon.

My friend opted to exit on the country roads side so we could get closer to the object from the safety of the car. This entire time the craft has been steadily lowering itself towards the lake. My friend and I continued to exchange what we were seeing with me being the main spotter while they drove. The longer we looked at the object the more adrenaline pumped through us. As we neared the exit we came directly under the craft now as it hovered about 200 feet above us. I twisted myself to look straight up through the front windshield. On the belly of the object, I saw a small trapezoid opening at the pointed nose end of the object. From the opening came a harsh yellow light. Silhouetted by that light were two humanoid figures. I flipped out with the idea that someone, some*thing* was staring down at us. The driver could not see though so I couldn't be sure.

After watching the object fade under the tree line as we drove away, we decided to go to my house. Once we got ourselves collected I drew [this](https://imgur.com/a/Gr9U9Q8) as my point of view directly under the object.

I am willing to accept this entire experience as a shared hallucination, it is more than likely and makes the most sense given the circumstances.

However, a few things happened afterward that made me think about the experience.

Two months after the trip and sighting in early February, there was a ""military practice operation"" over the airspace of the county. There were a lot of dark clouds that night but no rain. The sound of low flying jets and helicopters could be heard around the town from about eight at night till midnight. I saw a jet in a gap in the clouds while I took out the trash.

There was a sequel encounter. A few months later we were eating dinner in the early afternoon at the same spot. A light rain deterred everyone from coming to the park. I was eating takeout sushi when I spotted a pair of yellow headlights in the hazy grey clouds that hung low over the lake. A cone of illumination came from each one like a car in the fog, but the car was hanging stationary about 300 feet on the other side of the lake in a dense cloud. We both saw it. Neither of us could make out the details of the object besides the two shining lights that faded after a couple of minutes. We were both sober this time.

Interestingly enough there are a few Lockheed Martin facilities in the state with one being based out of a fort's airfield. So maybe it was an experimental aircraft? Of course, the drugs involved with the first sighting made it feel impossible to tell anyone because who would (rightfully) believe us? Has anyone had similar experiences in the Southeast?","Seeing a UFO on LSD, then seeing the same UFO sober months later"

aliens,"The matter of the ""Skinny Bob"" footage isn't going to be resolved by thinking or talking through it. But let me lay out a (minimally substantiated, it's true) case here, which some may find helpful or intriguing. My opinion centers mostly around the detail of the eyes -- specifically, the eyelids.

People's experiences with Greys tend to cohere around a group of commonalities, and one of them is the sense that Greys appear to have foregone the usage of certain parts of their body in favor of other developments: for example, telepathy supplants vocalized speech. In a couple of cases, people have heard Greys produce guttural or buzzing sounds, but it's not clear if this is a basic form of linguistic communication or something else. Anyway, abductees often describe Greys communicating with them mentally, sometimes implanting images. Abductees also describe Greys' mouths as unmoving, or barely moving, slits; and the noses as having been pretty much reduced to a pair of holes. Overall, Greys' bodies seem to be anatomically weak, comprised of obviously vestigial parts, and ultimately in service of a predominant mental capacity.

The most distinctive aspect of the Greys' appearance is their large and black eyes. I recently read Raymond Fowler's book, *The Watchers*, which details part of abductee Betty Andreason Luca's experiences. In one of her accounts, Luca describes observing Greys placing a (hybrid?) fetus in glass containment chamber, but -- here's the kicker -- not before *circumcising the eyelids*: meaning, in effect, that the being would either be *incapable of blinking*, or that blinking would be another kind of vestigial act, and that the eyelids would *not cover the whole eyes* when being used to blink.

Consequently, the most suggestive detail for me in the ""Skinny Bob"" footage center on the eyes and lids. [The figure in the footage indeed blinks, but note how *the lids only seem to cover an upper portion of the eyes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxCQiys2u-0). This could be a trick of the lighting. There are very heavy shadows around that region of the face. But if the lids are indeed only partially brought down, this would be a bizarrely specific detail for hoaxers to have included.

As a side note, I would say that, for me, the most compelling part of the alleged ET/UT/CT footage from the 1997 documentary, [*Area 51: The Alien Interview*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdzV3VGzwo&amp;t=1934s), is precisely that which compels some people to laughingly dismiss it offhand: that is, the fact that the figure appears to have practically no facial movement besides a slight opening of the mouth when it is ostensibly in distress, and also appears to have an almost comically weak coordination between its head and body. It seems to me that if one wanted to fake footage, in the late 90s, which would be guaranteed to have a sensational effect, one would prioritize a model whose expression and bodily movement wasn't so inorganically static and puppet-like, respectively speaking.

P.S.: I think that Luca's account of the Greys tampering with fetal development brings up at least one immediate question, which is: if the fetuses ostensibly *become* the Greys (which is what Luca says the Greys told her), what would a Grey have been like *before* fetal tampering?","The most suspicious, or convincing, aspect of the ""Skinny Bob"" footage: eyelids/blinking"

aliens,"*  **Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalyonok:**  

On May 5, 1981, Retired Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalyonok saw  something remarkable from the porthole of Salyut 6. According to  Kovalyonok, at around 6 p.m., when the spacecraft was flying over South  Africa moving towards the Indian ocean, he saw an elliptical-shaped  object that was flying along with the spacecraft. From the frontal view,  it looked like it would rotate in flight direction.

 “The object resembles a barbell. I saw it becoming transparent and  like with a ‘body’ inside. At the other end I saw something like gas  discharging, like a reactive object. Then something happened that is  very difficult for me to describe from the point of view of physics,”  Kovalyonok said.

He further added: “I have to recognize that it did not have an  artificial origin. It was not artificial because an artificial object  couldn’t attain this form. I don’t know of anything that can make this  movement… tightening, then expanding, pulsating.

&amp;#x200B;

 Then as I was observing something happened, two explosions. One  explosion, and then 0.5 seconds later, the second part exploded. I  called my colleague Viktor Savinykh, but he didn’t arrive in time to  see anything.”

He explained: “the object moved in a suborbital path, otherwise I  wouldn’t have been able to see it. There were two clouds, like smoke,  that formed a barbell. It came near me and I watched it.”

Subsequently, they entered into the darkness (terminator or twilight  zone) for some time after the incident. When they came out of the zone,  the two spheres never returned.

* **Astronauts** **Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong:**

 Two UFOs fly over the lunar surface during the Moon landing. “On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window  that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of  what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country  or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or  the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the  rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close  vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And I feel absolutely convinced  that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels.  Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be  “unidentified.” - Buzz Aldrin

Participated 6 times in different space flights.  Between 1983 -1996, Musgrave spent almost 54 days in space.  In 1994, he told this story:  On two of his missions, he saw indefinable ""snake"" like objects in space.  They were estimated to be about 25 ft long (7.62 meters).  Musgrave believes there are more developed civilizations outside of Earth far ahead of us.  He also believes the universe is teeming with different lifeforms.

aliens,"okay so let me start this off with the fact that this happened years ago and my brother and friend (she was there and saw too) still talk about how unbelievable it was and how crazy it was.

so lets get the night started, my friend (c) came over and we just did the usual stuff that young kids did, watch funny youtube videos, gossip, etc. when we stumbled across ufo videos on youtube, and my friend commented on how she doesnt think aliens were real and how ufos are just fake, i then stsrted telling her all about my brothers (j) experiences and she still didnt believe me. 

few hours go by, my brother comes home from work and comes into my room (him being older than me so he annoys me) conversations happened and i brought up how (c) didn’t believe in aliens and thinks its all a hoax, my brother cant believe it and says “hell no you’re coming outside right now and we will find a ufo.” 

since it was summer it was relatively warm out (around 5°c) so (c) and i agreed, we grabbed shoes and sweaters and went outside with my brother, we spent around an hour and a half to two hours out in the backyard, we were sitting in chairs with pillows behind our necks so we didn’t notice lots of time going by.

we saw quite a few ufos or satellites either or there was lots, and some moved in ways that satellites would not be able to move in, so i 100% think ufos, you can think otherwise.

my brother proceeds to get frustrated cause we haven’t seem much and he wished something would happen, so we decide to go sit in the front to see if the other side of the sky we couldn’t see that we would see something better (little did we know we got what we asked for).

my friend and i proceed to get tired since we had to stand in the front to look up, we take a seat on the front steps and just start chatting, when my brother is like come look at this tiny star i found, i didn’t properly hear him so i freak out seeing him point up thinking something is there so i pull my friend up and drag her over to see what my brother was point at, and thats when we were looking all at the same empty area in the sky, no planes, no satellites, no drones, no clouds, completely clear just stars glistening, this fucking grey/blackish (hard to tell cause it was night) triangle appears like it was just sitting there invisible and shot across the sky leaving a blue/purple/green line behind it and then just disappeared like gone straight up vanished in plane sight.

it was crazy, my friend and i started crying and my brother was so hyped since this was the first time he actually could show me what ufos looked like, and then my mom pulled up to the house as she just got off work (around 11pm) we immediately told her and she was amazed and wish she saw it too.

this was maybe around 5-6 years ago and whenever my friend and i see each other (we dont see each other that much anymore) we always talk about the experience and how she always looks at the stars at night while she takes her bong rips hoping to see another one someday.

this experience for my was extremely important in my life since i have always been a believer of aliens and always wanted to see a ufo (especially because growing up my brother always told me about his experiences with ufos and made me always look at stars.

i’m now 17 almost 18 and i still look at the stars every night with my brother and i till am euphoric about that experience because it was amazing. 

thanks for reading my story and any questions you have i will try to answer! :) i hope my experience made you feel as excited as it made me feel! ahh oki thanks for reading byeee

So what are the chances that Elons family are descendants of an Advance Intelligent Alien race? Or do you guys think that Elon just happens to be one of the smartest people on the planet just because those type humans come around every 50-100 years or so?

It’s interesting to think about. You have the reports of scientists might think there are humans everywhere in each galaxy/universe. Then you have the UFO sighting in Zimbabwe in ‘94 that was close to Musk hometown in South Africa, I’m not saying Elon was there but if Aliens showed up to some random kids in Zimbabwe in ‘94 what are the chances they showed up previously in Elons hometown trying to alter some Human DNA before Elon was born to create Elon? lol, it’s a bit of a stretch, I know. It’s just intriguing to think about from UFO events of the past then fast forward the UFOs/UAPs topic is hotter then ever and Elon is just casually creating a better future for humanity one day at a time, trying to get our asses on Mars and revive a dead planet.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to live in Changchun, Jilin, in the northeast of China as an English teacher (unfortunately hired by a corrupt dispatch agency, but that's a whole other post for a whole other subreddit). It was around late Spring/early Summer, 2020, the hard lockdown had just ended, and people were out and about (masks, and QR code scanning was mandatory, and for anyone who's ever lived there, you'll know that the Chinese don't really have a concept of ""social distancing"").  I'd just finished something I'd been working on and felt pretty good about myself.  I lived in the Nanguan district, really close to the river and had a habit of going out for evening walks. I enjoyed watching the varieties of dance/tai-chi/kung-fu and so on, and on rare occasions, participated. Anyway, I wasn't long into my walk when behind me I hear a collective ""Phwoar!!!"" I do a full 180 spin around, and look up and there I see it, a rotating triangle craft (I'd say about the size of a typical suburban house), hovering just above the trees (I don't like to say 'hovering', because other than rotating, it was *perfectly still*) I think to myself ""Is that drone? What a bunch of c\*\*\*\*."" (Yes, I realise how thinking that makes me look, but in my personal experience, some Chinese are known to have utter disregard for the rules until caught, and then act all like ""Oh, look at me. How naughty of me. I got caught! Tee hee!"" My mind went to ""drone"" first because over the weeks I'd often see grandpas out with their grandsons (presumably) uncles/nephews; dads/sons... whatever... flying drones. I don't recall seeing any ""no drones"" signs around, but just that fact that it was so near powerlines made it seem really unsafe to me. Immediately after I'd thought what I'd thought - like, the split second I finished thinking it - it stopped rotating and went up, slightly to the north, faster and quieter than technology we currently know of. And it was SO QUIET. It was literally so quiet that you could, for lack of a better term 'hear the silence.' Had it not have been for hearing that collective ""Phwoar!!!"" I never would've turned around, and never known it was there)  For some reason seeing that ""drone"" weighed on my mind and it wasn't until falling asleep that night that I realised ""That was no drone! I saw a UFO!!!""

By the way, when I say ""triangle"", it's more like hexagonal, but with three much longer sides, and three much shorter sides, giving the overall impression of a triangle. It had (red) lights on the shorter sides (like, actually on the side, not underneath). It was slightly domed in the centre at the bottom.

After some online research I've discovered that these can be attributed to either the Essassani or the Yahyel, which are various generations of grey hybrids, I believe, but I'm not sure which generation either one is.

  
Pre-empting your questions:

**Why didn't you take a photo/video?**  
Why would I take a photo/video of something as common as a drone?

**How low/high was it?**  
Just above the tree tops (were I atop a tree, I could've reached out and touched it).

**What colour was it?**  
Matte black, with red lights.

**Missing time?**  
None. Remember, I saw it amongst a crowd of people (which I'm assuming makes a difference).

**Have there been any reports (official or otherwise) from China about this?**  
None that I know of.

**What do you think they were doing?**

aliens,"Okay, my topic (and question for debate) is... (drum roll)

Do you think that the Nazis recovered a UFO just prior to WW2 in the Black Forest (I think it was in 1935 or 36), and if so, do you think they back engineered it to build die glocke? Assuming you believe so - is die glocke the same object that was recovered in Kecksburg, PA in 1965? If that is the case, who do you think was ""recovered"" from inside the Kecksburg object? Okay, that's actually four questions - at least they are all related :)

aliens,"I started watching the show last night and it is hard to enjoy it. Everything just seems so forced and not actually scientific. I didn't see the first season and started off on the second, but even in the first episode, they looked to dig in a hole that was predug and covered with debris. They dug a few feet down then just stopped as ""spooky"" things happened. Not sure if they revisit the hole again, not that far. But I just can't shake how this program just seems to be a waste of time that trickles small nuggets of real info. 

In my opinion so far I can see this show going one of two ways. They are either going to stumble upon a craft in some future season that brings the tech into the public's eye. Alternatively it's a coverup where where they are actually describing working/figuring out such a craft/tech and they call it the ""ranch."" I'm skeptical of either and open to other thing, but I think it's the best way to hide a secret project right in the face of the public. The way they describe the ranch is almost like an inside joke.

aliens,"Let me start this off by saying the that anything discussed in this thread is more than likely (almost definitely) going to be speculative or, at best, an educated guess. 


Several months ago I read a thread on here entitled “divine beasts.” It did not gain much traction and the comments were mostly people calling the op crazy. You can’t really blame them as the op was making some wild claims and presenting them as facts. However, that thread really got me wondering what the limitations of our biological bodies could be with the most scientifically advanced bioengineering. This is something I’ve always occasionally thought about but that thread really got me thinking about it.


On one hand, I am inclined to believe that it is more than likely that there is no limit to what science can achieve. On the other hand, if there were no limits to science then there would be no need for ETs to have crafts and there would be no need for the biological drones known as greys (the seemingly prevailing theory to many).


It’s not hard to imagine that the most advanced civilizations would be able to biologically engineer themselves to be super human. The would likely be able to make their body stronger than steel, their muscles over 10 to maybe 100 times stronger than normal, and they may be able to grow organs when their own start to go out that they may be effectively immortal. But where does that end? 


If zero point energy is possible, the answer may be wherever we want it to. A body may be able to be engineered that did not rely on food, water, and oxygen. Some or all organs could be deemed unnecessary if we are able to modify the body up to a certain point that we no longer rely on food for energy. New organs could be designed that make the energy from the zero point source usable by our bodies. It could be completely self sustaining and have unlimited power. 


The argument could be made that even given bioengineering sciences advanced to their maximum level would still run into the problem that a device capable of generating zero point energy would not fit into the size of a typical body or would create too much heat. I would argue that if we are to the point of being capable of zero point energy then we would likely be able to manipulate the fabric of reality and such issues would be trivial to solve. One idea is that the energy could be teleported to were it is needed - which if we were capable of zero point energy I would assume - big assumption - we would be capable of. 


But such technological advancement would effectively make an individual god. If we had the technology i mentioned then there would be nothing stopping a self sustaining individual from being able to manipulate the fabric of reality. 


I understand that this is wildly speculative and had no scientific backing and this post makes me sound really crazy, but I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts and speculations on this. Anything from bio engineered steel skinned super humans harder than steel to zero point energy powered gods.",Maximum potential and limitations of bio-engineered bodies?
aliens,"Life as we know it is not rare, I’d go as far as say it’s somewhat common, depending on what scale you are talking about. If we’re talking about the minimum requirements for life, (which we can’t even agree on) sticking with a conservative figure when accounting for planets in the goldielocks zone, there would still be tens of thousands of planets in our galaxy harboring life.

Let’s be honest, microscopic life is nothing to get exited about. What we really want, and what the whole point of this subreddit is about is advanced, intelligent life with technology so beyond ours that we could consider them gods. 

While this is still something that I consider within the realm of possibility, I think a more realistic approach is that these types of civilizations are extremely or do not exist yet. My reasoning for this is simple, look at countless amount of events that had to occur just for us to be here. Change anyone of them and there’s no humans. I’m talking about mass extinction events, countless mutations which had to coincide with the conditions of the earth at the time, all had to happen in just that way and in that order for us to be here. 

The dinosaurs existed for 150 million years and as far as we know they were just big dumb animals the entire time. A one in a billion collision changed that, but imagine if it never happened? Then there’s other mass extinction events that allowed other species to emerge and thrive and allow our ancestors to have a go at it. And even then, we just happened to have adequate biological characteristics to make the most of the opportunity.

The more I learn about biology the more I understand how rare out existence really is. Take trees for example, I never gave much thought to them, but they existed for tens of millions of years without ever decomposing. Before fungi randomly mutated and developed the ability to decompose them, dead trees would just pile up and occasionally light the entire earth on fire for thousands of years.

There’s countless examples, but it all comes down to having specific mutations happen at just the right time on earth where just the right conditions were present. We have the skewed perception on just how incredibly rare that is because we ourselves are a product of these conditions.

Despite all the odds, here we are, and as far as space travel goes, we are still very primitive. This is why I think intelligent life, capable of interstellar travel is extremely rare or nonexistent. Perhaps they are out there, but the vast distances in the universe pose a serious challenge. Let’s leap into sci-fi for a bit, let’s say we leave for the stars today, at the speed of light. We could only hope to colonize our galaxy and local cluster. Maybe less then 5% of the observable universe. This is due to the expansion of the universe, we will literally never reach furthest regions of the universe. It’s the same for any other civilizations out there, this is why I say we are essentially alone in the universe.",Intelligent life is incomprehensibly rare that we are essentially “alone” in the universe

Pretty quickly, I noticed that the kid below me is pretty into edm music (electronic dance music). Not that I have any kind of problem with that or anything, I just thought it was a little peculiar how it's really like all he listens to, and u can hear him playing it at all different hours throughout the day lol. I wanted to get a chance to run into him eventually, because I had some songs I wanted to recommend to him n was also curious about some stuff I heard him playing. Well, when I finally did, I was just a little shocked to find out that this dude is in his atleast mid 40s lol. And then so on top this, hes bald, and has a very peculiar face, kind of like he looks like he could be woody Harrelsons brother or something hahah. His voice is strangely alittle high pitched, and he has a interesting dress style thats similar to like a yoga instructor or something. like real loose fitting clothing with sandals, that I can see he's still wearing even though it's getting into the 40s here now though. So it did t take long for me to conclude that this dude might be a freaking alien lol. A Nordic to be specific, because I know I've read that a lot of them are really into electronic music. But the only thing is, he's not that tall or anything and he's bald too. So maybe he could be some kind of Nordic hybrid. Which would kind of make sense because of the connection u could make.between his strange looks and him being the result of interspecies relationship hahah. Or I guess he could always just be a weird dude in his mid 40s who just really likes techno. Idk. He's nice though and I always have a little chat with him now whenever I see him.

aliens,"I know I just posted something else, but is it possible we are witnessing Gog and Magog? I don't know a lot about the ""zoo theory,"" but when I think about how humans interact with different species my concerns grow.  (Are humans food?) 

I used to look to the stars with wonder and believed it more likely for beings from space to be benevolent than malevolent. I suffer from an incurable naiveté in some respects. I have started to think people who have repeated sightings or encounters are groomed. 

I don't want to sound preachy or overly religious, but I think the ones who resist, can be saved from having their lives devoured and kept from falling into the various UFO cults. 

The human species though, if ""aliens"" are as far from us as we are from apes, then I think we all have cause for concern. When we think about how apes interact with their environment and we compare how humans interact with their environment, it isn't very difficult to see how an alien race might find our species to be ""defective."" 

Think about it, are there any other species on earth that destroy their own AND adjacent habitats? This really brings the teachings of Christ into sharp focus, ""Love you neighbor as you love yourself."" 

I think Christ was giving us a cautionary tale and an allegory about ""victory over death."" What does ""everlasting life"" really mean?

Human beings are very perceptive. When children hear their parents fighting, children act out. The rising tensions all around may be pointing to a conflict that is already happening beyond what's happening within our own societies. 

I have the sense that governments have already surrendered. Not just that, I think it's possible that governments may be undermining the individuals among us who are willing to stand in the gap so to speak. 

I could be wrong or crazy. I don't know because I have suffered so much mental harm. The war in heaven is happening in the heavens and how contact and sightings have changed over the last 20-30 years might be a clue as to how that war is going. 

What do you think? I think good will overcome evil in the end. How we survive between now and what life on earth will be like when victory is won, we have been given a path to salvation.

aliens,"I posted this on /r/ufos but it was removed for being off-topic, so hopefully it fits here a bit better. 

We often take a fairytale view of the cosmos, and this could be a massive blindspot that endangers our species.

A lot of our science fiction portrays humans coexisting alongside alien species relatively peacefully. We're usually shown having technological parity with them, too, by which I mean human weapons and space ships are more or less equivalent in power and capability with aliens so we can defend ourselves. Obviously our capacity for spaceflight right now is extremely primitive, but we like to believe in a future where we can build big, cool ships with guns and lasers that can fight back against aliens with some level of symmetry to the warfare.

But think for a moment about this. What I'm describing here boils down to the Dark Forest theory, and my thoughts were inspired by the Three Body Problem trilogy of books:

* **It's unlikely that we'd ever have technological parity with an advanced alien civilization.** Think of the difference in just 200 years of Earth technology. That's horses and muskets and cannons vs. jet airplanes and satellites and nuclear weapons. Could an army from 1821 hold out against a modern military?  
Now contemplate how unlikely it is that our civilizations happend to develop and advance within 200 years of one another... they could be 500 years ahead of us, 1,000 years, 10,000 years. They could have technology we don't even comprehend, based on science that we haven't even started to realize. Our most advanced weapons could be laughably primitive, easily destroyed, posing absolutely no threat.
* **The possibility that we** ***could*** **reach technological parity with an alien civilization might force them to destroy us pre-emptively.** Think again about how far human technology has progressed in just 200 years. That's a technological explosion. We went from agrarian societies to industrialization in the blink of an eye on a cosmic scale.  
In another 200 years, humanity could take gigantic, transformative technological leaps we can scarcely imagine, and that fact alone could make us a defacto threat to any other intelligent civilization.  
We often believe that a sufficiently advanced civilization wouldn't worry about us because they could easily overpower us, so we present no threat. But we could grow into a very real threat that can no longer be contained, or a niusance that gets in the way of their plans. Either way, we'd be fully at their mercy to decide our fate.  
Whichever civilization holds the asymmetrical edge in technology directly threatens the existence of their neighbors, or at the very least threatens to expand so rapidly as to take all the nearby resources they depend on for their own expansion. So if you allow any intelligent species to develop unchecked, there's a chance that they could some day subjugate you or annihilate you.
* **We can't know the true intentions of any alien civilization.** We think about aliens in the same way as we might think about two different human civlizations meeting. But there's a possibility that there would be such stark differences in our evolutionary biology that we might seem incomprehensible to one another. Our motives, our thought processes, our survival strategies, our willingness to trust one another - it's all in question. We already struggle to treat fellow humans with dignity based on the tiniest differences in skin color or culture.  
Even if we assure one another that we intend to be peaceful, how can we be certain? If one side or the other lies and gains a technological advantage, you again run the risk of extermination. That causes suspicion, and that suspicion causes fear, and that fear could, again, motivate pre-emptive annihilation. If you guess wrong and assume a violent civilization is friendly, the cost is extinction, and therefore the stakes are as high as possible.
* **It may be that we've never found an alien civilization because being found leads to destruction.** Given the number of stars in the galaxy and the age of the universe, the chance that no other life exists in the cosmos seems unlikely, and yet, small as our sample size is, we've never found evidence of intelligent life (Fermi Paradox). It could be that life is harder to develop than we realize. It could be that they developed much farther away than we can see or contact. Or it could be that they are hiding.  
If we take all of these ideas together, the best strategy for any civilization to survive is to stay hidden. If you can't be found, you can't be killed. If you can't be killed, you can expand and advance until you become the dominant civilization that's no longer threatened. And if you become the dominant civilization, you may have to eradicate everyone else you find to protect your hegemony.
* **If we have indeed encountered extraterrestrial space craft on Earth or found evidence of ET civlizations, governements may choose not to disclose this information to keep panic and risk at a minimum.** Military thinkers no doubt have contemplated these exact issues before. If we do indeed have reason to believe aliens have found Earth or are aware of our existence in some way, they may not reveal this information because of the potential for instability.  
We have no idea how the planet as a whole would react to this information. Even if we did, there's probably nothing we could realistically do to thwart an alien threat to life on Earth. We're the cosmic equivalent of newly evolved human beings who haven't even ventured out of Africa yet. We're ignorant and vulnerable to an absurd degree.

So perhaps it's best to hope that everything you see on [r/ufos](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufos/) is fake or misdentified. We look up at the stars with wonder and amazement, hoping to become part of a friendly galactic club of intelligent life forms, but we may be looking at a savannah where predators that dwarf us lurk around every corner, a battlefield where snipers and artillery are positioned to kill anything that moves, a life or death game of chess where we're hardly a microbe on the bottom of a pawn, ready to be wiped away without a second thought.",We often underestimate the potential danger of communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence

aliens,"weird alien story here?? Idek what to call it. 

okay so this is so bizarre and y’all probably won’t believe it...but here we go. I grew up in Maine, pre rural college town. I was maybe 14 or so when this happened. I’m now 23. I remember this clear as day and have never been able to explain it. In fact I often am embarrassed telling people this as I struggle to trust it happened it’s so bizarre...

It was a late spring, early summer night. A girlfriend and I decided to walk into town and hang out on this walking bridge that crossed over the railroad tracks in my town. we went for walks and often ended up there as it was quiet, and made us feel like little badasses to sit on the side of the bridge, feet dangling over the tracks. So we’re talking and looking at the stars when we notice these two orbs of light kind of orbiting each other. Almost as if they’re playfully teasing one another, moving and and moving out in proximity in this strange way. They loved quite fast and seemed to be moving upward and to the right slowly, mostly staying in the same general area. We got really quiet and watched them for at least 20 minutes. We couldn’t figure out what it could be especially as we lived two hours from the nearest city and hardly had any light pollution. 

After awhile we decided to head home as it was after 10:30 or so and it was about a 20-25 minute walk back to my house. the bridge we were on was located in back of the Public library next to an old school house that was used as a community center and thrift store. On the other side of the bridge was a low income retirement and apartment area. To reach the street we had to go past the school house and through a small community garden as well as parking lot before making it to the street. As we turn to go we are perfectly alone. We hadn’t seen anybody around the hour we were there. As I said, quiet, sleepy, town. It’s dark as we turn to go, but we don’t see anything out of the ordinary. The Parking lot is lit and empty. Before leaving we take one last look at the  lights which are still pulsating and dancing in and around each other. When we turn back we freeze. In the middle of the Parking lot ahead, lit by a street lamp, is a hunched over man(?) in an overcoat and what I remember to be a hanging chained pocket watch by his side. He’s looking right at us. He appeared so suddenly there was no time to think: we ran. We ran to the left up the hill in back of the library so fast I lost my bracelet I always wore. We didn’t stop until we were across the bridge to the other side of town where I lived. Walking back out of breath we hardly had words for what happened. We could barely talk about it that night, and even the next day after we went back to retrieve my bracelet, proof of what had happened as it was on the grass where I’d lost it, we couldn’t talk about it. But deep down I knew there was a link between the lights and the creature that pretty much materialized out of nothing. 

When I did mention it to my brother down the line, he chocked it up to be lights from the airport in the town over. I think it’s too far away, and I’d never seen lights chase each other like that, let alone in skies that are always clear and that I’d looked at often. I used to think it was an old man from the apartments on the other side of the bridge, but that doesn’t make sense either. And the two gotta be linked. He didn’t feel human. Or even ghostly. Sometimes I think I saw a time traveler. He appeared in no time at all and had this ineffable, eerie quality. 

I’ve never been so afraid.

Ive had a lot of paranormal visitations, signs etc but those feel very different in nature and posses a different quality whether those experiences were positive or negative.  this, however, was my first alien experience? inhuman? I don’t even know what words begins to describe it. It felt so unnatural, I guess, and that’s what instilled me with the most fear, I think. Thoughts and questions welcome!",Time Traveler encounter?

aliens,"So I’ve been having multiple lucid dreams over the last few weeks/months and some were some of the most incredibly deep felt vivid dreams I’ve ever experienced. One was with someone I hadn’t seen since my final art exam in my final week at school 7 years ago who was never my friend merely classroom accomplice.

One of the dreams was walking up to a group of people of what looked like a random busy place on a busy stretch of road on a corner and she was huddle walking next to me they were rushing towards us as if they knew we were about to tell them something huge. I look up and see this ship rapidly take off at 90 degree angle. As if I was saying goodbye almost. 

I’ve had other multiple dreams about being on an operating bed usually tied arms and legs with creatures stood around me of all kinds. Not greys, more like reptilian creatures. I’ve never felt anything in these dreams only knew I was dreaming or at least I fucking hope I was. Then again I’ve been hoping for an abduction because regardless; I’m one of those that want to experience it (even if it’s negative because in my eyes it’s a lifetime of an opportunity) (I’m sorry if this insults anyone who have had genuine awful abductions). Anyways. 

I lucid dream a lot which is alarming enough but I think that’s because of my sleeping difficulties and bad sleeping rituals that cause them likely. However; the type of dream is usually harmless. I never seem to be overly afraid of abductions either. I seem to feel pretty calm and content while dreaming them.

I’m just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience whether I’m just fucking loopy and alien obsessed or if it might actually signal or mean something? Is it warning me about my future? Could I end up being abducted and living a nightmare? Who fucking knows anything anymore to be honest but I’d thought I’d share because I thought it would be interesting if anyone has felt they were abduction had similar symptoms before after or during.

Thanks! Lol sorry if this is weird.",Can lucid dreams about alien abductions be an actual alien abduction?

Many ppl know the videos of Skinny bob, but I think fewer saw this freakingly unbelievable video of what has been described as an alien interview from Area51, and I just want to share it with y'all to know your opinion about it.

For me personally, I find it more interesting than the Skinny bob one, and the main reason is that towards the end of the footage, you can see some doctors/nurses getting so close to the alien and interact and examine him! I was just blown away when I saw this cuz I didn't expect at all the humans there to get that close to him, in every single video of a supposed alien, you never ever see humans interact with the alien, but this one ! it's just amazing.

tho there is only one thing that kept me from believing 100% this footage ( and thus losing my mind lol ) is that you never see the alien blink, so if this ""alien"" is just a kid wearing some type of s suit, it will be so hard to simulate the blinking of an alien.","in case you didn't see it, you HAVE to watch this video of an alleged alien interview in Area 51, it's just the best one so far."

aliens," 

I did a probe of [u/AlienWhoFoundReddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/AlienWhoFoundReddit/) and here's what I'm noticing so far.

There are about 330 diverse words/labels that occur only once (separated by spaces). However, many word-parts repeat often (separated by apostrophes). About 20 words are repeated multiple times by different identities. Word parts have 2-5 letters. Words have 3-10 letters consisting of 1-3 word parts connected by 0-2 apostrophes. All words are within these parameters.

I tried translating on different websites with every language available. A few of the word parts seem to be Latin, but a few could be other languages. Yet for the most part, they don’t translate at all. The whole words don’t translate into any language.

15 individuals posted or commented (12 greys, 3 overseers) and some of these are mentioned by others. Many more individuals are mentioned who didn’t post.

Three human strands are mentioned six times by different greys (12,073, 11,385, 11,245).

Several identifiers are repeated at the beginning of various identities. For example, there are eight ZV- types, six CX- types, five ZZ- types, four XR- types, etc.

I did not include plain numbers or English words in this analysis. However, there are a lot of numbers, long strings as well as smaller sets that appear to be data or identification.

Sau’zrk means Sauron and is mentioned several times, including specific ones. Some saurons appear to make confrontational comments trying to divert people who comment. The greys respond politely to saurons and people.

XNN- is a space/underwater craft identifier.

XMN- is an identifier for something/someone seeded with human strands.

Xor’ren might mean Xarvian or Grey as it appears before this one, XVG-17891, a couple times.

So what do you think? That it’s all nonsense and I just have an unhealthy obsession? Lol! Or is it a real alien language? Yikes! I hope not.",Deep Dive into the Xarvian Collective

They are probably closer to how the military probably is here on earth, and maybe their race back home acts &amp; operates completely different under different laws or rules. Even could be nicer or meaner overall, who knows! They may even have different belief systems as their counterparts visiting this planet do. I mean think about the level of experience you need and training etc you have to have just to fly an aircraft.

The aliens we encounter on our planet may or may not even be an accurate representation of how their culture is.

aliens,[deleted],Many of you asked the source of the document that states “aliens are among us and undetectable so disclosure can’t happen because of inevitable chaos”. The source is in comments.
aliens,"Most people agree that The Disclosure event, when then governments disclose a possible truth about so called aliens, will be a significant milestone in humanity's history. But how exactly it will change the course of history? Let's speculate!

The Disclosure will most likely be done in phases, for example first the governments will admit there are aliens and then, after a while, what kind of aliens, then their origin, then their technology and so forth. The Disclosure thus may not be a single, but multiple events spanning weeks/months. Documents will also be gradually unclassified.

Most people will be definitely shocked at first news, but will likely be back to normal in a matter of days. Mentally unstable people may be struggling more. UFO sightings and encounters had occurred throughout the whole humanity's history, so most of the population already consider there may be an unknown life in the universe, or even here on this planet. There will unlikely be any significant planet-wide panic.

Most religions will be able to adapt to the new paradigm that we're not alone. Some religions are already enough alien-proof today (Buddhism, Hinduism, Scientology etc.) Certain religions proved to adapt to a changing world, like Christianity embracing Solar system concept, then sex for pleasure and gay marriage. These will adapt to the new reality. Some religions will find references in their respective holy books, which will make them compatible to a multi-life universe. In any case, the amount of religious people will expected to drastically decline after the event. Some brand new religions will definitely be started.

The most profound effect and result of The Disclosure will have the unveiling of brand new technology. This will most likely be a single most important driver for the event to occur. It is considered the governments have acquired the failed extraterrestrial craft and reverse-engineered some of their tech. There will be announcement and declassification of files related to the reverse-engineered tech (like transistor, radar, Teflon and other breakthrough technologies).

Applied sciences like physics will change significantly, although not all of the alien knowledge will be made available, but most likely only related to the reverse-engineered tech. It will still be a huge paradigm shift.

The most sought after tech is undoubtedly new energy tech. Once unveiled, it will make fossil fuel-based energy obsolete. The price of energy will decrease by orders of magnitude. Most likely governments will provide energy for free to some low-income groups. Research and development of energy-efficient tech will decrease, because of the sudden abundance of energy.

Countries, which heavily rely on fossil fuel export, will suffer a lot (think Russia, UAE, Venezuela etc). They will try to diversify, but this will take years/decades.

Fossil fuel-charged climate crisis will lessen and humanity will finally have a chance to reverse the warming without affecting production much.

At some point it will be possible to make contact with aliens. First online, then physically. Think about any kind of contacts.

There will be transfer of a lot of knowledge, but most likely aliens will not gift humans technologies which humanity didn't yet obtain. Philosophy will progress a lot, spawning new branches.

Finally, what happens with the governments? It is tempting to think about some kind of a World Government, but frankly, this has to be started by humans themselves. And humanity as a whole is not yet ready to be truly united, so the new reality will most likely not change anything in this regard. But the concrete knowledge that we're not alone will likely help people think about what unites us, and not what divides.",After The Disclosure: let's speculate

aliens,"just woke up and wanna share this with y’all. this is one of the most vivid dreams i’ve ever had

it started with me browsing Twitter and suddenly seeing a bunch of videos of reddish/orange orbs on my feed of all around the world. they were trending #1 on Twitter. i went outside and I could see them too. a few of my neighbours were looking at them too. i remember staring at one and thinking “hi, oh my god, are you guys finally here?” like I had a connection with the orb. they moved without a purpose for now, just showing up and disappearing

soon after, I guess the government couldn’t “hide” (not exactly hide, i’ll come back to it later) it anymore. my phone beeped with that AMBER alert sound and they announced on TV they’d be coming to New York later at night. i also remember tweets from news channels like “They are coming to New York TONIGHT!!” starting to show up

this is when the dream starts to get exciting

right after the announcement, i could hear a lot of sirens. a lot of police cars suddenly started roaming the streets, it felt like a terrorist attack just happened close to me. police helicopters, special forces, whatever, just roaming the streets with their sirens on.

right after the announcement, too, i felt this feeling of doom and existencial crisis; the world started to get darker and without meaning. i remember the colours of my house started to get a bit grey and dull. my heart was heavy and I think I almost woke up with fear. i remember thinking about the economy and crimes rising for some reason

but what’s strange is that that feeling of doom was temporary, only lasted a few minutes. i went outside again and suddenly, a shit ton of my neighbours were on the streets, screaming (happily) and chanting. they were bringing chairs and drinks from inside their houses and placing them outside to sit and watch the orbs. some were banging their pans, some were singing songs. all while watching the orbs

the last time I felt unity like that was back when I used to live in Brazil during the 2009’s world cup, and even then it felt 100x more powerful than that. think about the time your country was united for some reason, multiply that by a thousand, that’s the feeling I had in the dream.

i can’t explain to y’all the sense of unity and happiness we had, it’s impossible to explain, it was like the whole world came together. i rushed inside the house to tell my parents “they are here! they are here!”. 

i started calling friends, people I fought with, people I haven’t spoke to in years, people that did me bad, people that hurt me, not to reconcile with them, but just to say “dude, they are here”

the people in the TV (news anchors, reporters, etc.) after the govt. announcement were also happy and smiling, i remember they couldn’t stop smiling, they could barely talk. they started crying saying “just cut to the images.” 

the TV showed images and videos of people all around the world getting together, chanting, jumping, singing, on the streets. streets of Brazil, U.S, Europe, were crowded. everywhere was crowded; millions of people chanting and watching the orbs move

New York Times Square was the most crowded, people were building tents and getting ready for the orbs to drop

the orbs over my house were now stronger, and they moved in groups, like they were going to New York or some place to get ready to show themselves. 

also, just a note, although we were united and happy, there was a lot of police/military security checkpoints every mile or so

also, another thing. after the announcement and when the orbs felt “closer”, animals started to move erratically and do some weird things. i remember my dog barking for no reason at a wall and getting dizzy. some birds started singing like crazy and some dropped dead (?), but that’s all i remember.

the reddish/orange orbs started to come down on Times Square, i remember trying to refresh my Twitter feed but the internet went down at that moment. unfortunately I woke up, and here I am writing this. i did see the aliens, tho:

—

i said “hide”, but the government wasn’t really hiding anything. in the dream, most people in the world knew aliens existed. there were tons of videos of these aliens on the Internet; if the government released them or they were leaked, I’m not sure. the thing is that they never showed themselves to the public

these videos just showed the aliens walking with world leaders and some men in black suits, like they were going to a meeting in a secret place in the desert. some images showed the aliens with world leaders in underground places. the aliens looked funny, short and tiny, like super short. probably 4’0.

everyone on Twitter already had seen these videos. they also knew these aliens were friendly. I think that’s the reason why everyone was so happy and united about them coming here.

—

there’s a lot of details in the dream i left out, like how the aliens looked like exactly, how some countries reacted badly, and how my Christian parents reacted. but otherwise, the post would be too long

whatever this dream was, if it ever happens, i hope we all feel this level of unity because holy shit, the feeling was amazing",Just woke up. Had a dream about alien disclosure. It was amazing.

aliens,"While visiting a family ranch near El Paso a few years ago it was brought to my attention that native burial sites, along with well preserved fire pits and food processing locations were scattered amongst the rock faces. Intertwined with areas of obvious human disturbance, there were petroglyphs depicting a variety of animals, geographic features, and what appeared to be crafts descending from the sky. Most notable about these strange vehicles was the depiction of the occupants. Not only were they twice as tall as the standard drawings of natives but they had large head pieces and massive eyes or, as far as I can discern, goggles. Another common feature of these petroglyphs were hand prints. On drawings near the extra large persons of interest, many hands included an extra finger. 

Seeing these in the late desert sun put me in a state of excitement, I felt like a toddler opening my eyes on Christmas morning. Although these drawings don't really mean anything explicit, what would happen later in the night would change my perception of extraterrestrials forever. Coincidence or not.

As my mother and I walked through the mountains, examining the sites and taking pictures, we eventually came up to a sort of famous location amongst the family. It was a traditional burial in a rock crevice. In a fashion that I was told was held for only chiefs, and ""Shamans"" or the tall figures aforementioned. Admittedly I was a bit skeptical. Stacked flat rocks in a crevice. Cool. I pull out my galaxy S5 and open my camera, as soon as I engage the button to take the picture my phone is bricked. As I take the battery out and put it back in my screen wakes up and freezes, as I allow it to run it's course I open my gallery and every image is grey. Confused but undeterred I simply walk on and eventually my phone regains function, and the pictures. Minus the one of the burial site. 

Later on that night we are at my Grandfather's (where we had been staying) and there is lasagna in the kitchen with family arriving periodically. I go to the bathroom to freshen up and as I step over to toilet to have a pee my ears begin ringing loudly, so loudly it brings me to my knees and I lay on the bathroom carpet in severe discomfort. As the ringing pans between my ears I can hear a dense radio static, and screaming. None of it is specific in any manner, just muddled phrases I could not break apart. After a few seconds of this I hear what I think is some form of radio operator telling me to get down. And I did. I stayed on the bathroom floor for another 4 or 5 minutes and then went to go eat lasagna.","A bizarre run in with, what may or may not have been an extraterrestrial burial ground"

Why would ETs want anything at all, to do with homo sapiens, sapiens we whine? Like cargo cults wishing for John Frum. Like an alien in Tanna, David Attenborough was told in Vanuatu “‘E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man”.

They may have as little in common with us, as we have with Australopithecus of 3 million year ago. As such, aren’t we best left alone to live and die where we’ve been born, like gorillas and orangutans-good to visit and gawk at, but don't let them loose in your neighborhood?

We have come so far together; we have reached so high. We can rest in peace of knowing, the beauty of our arts and majesty of our science, what wonders we did alone achieve. Yes! We can rest in peace. This naked ape didn’t do too bad. Did we? So:

“Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, 

Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed 

By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, 

Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch 

About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.”

"" Senator Gillibrand submitted an important amendment for inclusion in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the government to strengthen its investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena , otherwise known as UFOs.  SA 4281. Mrs. GILLIBRAND submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. REED and intended to be proposed to the bill H.R. 4350.

As your constituent I urge you to support this amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 as it is vital to our nation's security.  

We have documented these unknown craft using advanced technology, and we cannot evict them from our nation's airspace even if we wanted to do so as they outclass our own technology.

This is documented in the Pentagon's June 2021 UAP report, as well as the declassified videos they have released.

We do not know if these are Russian, Chinese, or some other adversary. 

These craft seem to be engaged in studying our nuclear powered naval assets,  ships, submarines,  and also nuclear reactors, waste storage sites, and nuclear missile silos, and nuclear weapon storage sites.

If this is reconnaissance by an adversary using this advanced technology we need to be investing significantly more money to understand and then counter it.

We need to fully fund and study this phenomenon to determine what risk, if any, is posed to our nation. 

We need answers. 

Please support Senator Gillibrand's Amendment SA 4281 to the NDAA of 2022 H.R. 4350.  ","IMPORTANT: Please Contact Your Elected Officials. Tell Them To Support The Gillibrand NDAA 2022 Amendment To Fund, Study, And Disclose Findings On UAP"
aliens,"I'd like to state that this is just a little though experiment of sorts, a hypothesis if you will. I doubt that is the actual nature of our reality.

With that being said, it is encoded without our DNA to compete with each other, to protect those close to us. Tribes vs tribes basically, been going on since hunter-gatherer times. This incites conflict.

I really believe that there can be no art without suffering; at the very least, the very best kind of art is made when you understand the human condition well, the historical/cultural context and so forth.

Suffering and war makes you appreciate the value of peace. Take a soldier who lost countless friends in the trenches, starved and watched his family die. That soldier will truly understand the value of peace in ways we can't even begin to comprehend. In turn, people who understand this can create better art. The very best kind of movies, tv shows, video games, novels, paintings, poems, you name it; they all draw inspiration from real life emotions, from suffering. They are steeped in it. 

So what if some super intelligence really bored with exisiting decided to create this universe, us, to create art for it to enjoy. Obviously this assumes that a higher intelligence would be interested in something that might be beneath it.",What if the purpose behind our little bubble universe is to create art?
aliens,"This book is pretty good, more realistic than Chariots of the Gods but still has juicy alien stories.

Here we have experiences that would potentially bring us way closer to understanding the purpose of ETs on our planet than any blurry aircraft footage. But I just can't put together the diversity of the stories- the descriptions of the craft and beings are all over the place, except for slave-like greys I guess.

aliens,"So there was a lot that happened leading up to the main point of this dream. I often have end of the world dreams that wake me up with a blast, but this time it was aliens. 

Have you ever had a dream where you just know a specific fact? Nobody tells you, you don’t get any evidence but in your dream you and everyone around you knows the fact. The fact in this particular dream was that the world was ending. Large asteroids, big enough to turn Earth into a floating lava ball, were coming at us in the next few days.  Everyone knew and there was an eeriness to how everyone just went about there day, including me. 

I was at home, talking to my wife as we got ready for bed. She was telling me about a movie, I think the princess bride, (if that’s even a movie, I really don’t know.) I seen the silhouette of a large object moving overhead out the window, maybe 20 feet above the house. I didn’t interrupt my wife until I realized how slowly and silently the object was moving. Maybe I just wanted to listen to her talk and let her death be sudden and unannounced. 

It landed about 100 yards away from our house without making a single sound. It stood perpendicular to the ground. The object had the shape similar to a 3 armed mechanical squid. The strange thing was, it landed on its head with its 3 mechanical arms facing upwards. 

It slowly opened the three arms as blue lights simulated an electric current flowing through it. It blasted out an electrical force of some sort in a circular shape. As the blue haze moved quickly towards us I froze. It felt like the haze moved so slowly but so quickly at the same time. Once it hit me, I woke up. 

That’s basically it. Sorry for the trash writing but we’ve all had dreams that felt hard to explain. Anybody else have freaky dreams they’d like to share?","Just had a freaky dream, thought I’d share. Delete if not allowed."
aliens,"  Scout (my dog) woke my up. She was puking under the bed. I got her cleaned up and under the covers with me. She usually sleeps at my feet, but she wanted right next to me. She cuddled close curled to my back or stomach when I tossed and turned.

I heard men walking outside my house. I could hear them approaching my window.  I got scared and held my breath. They had flashlights. So I put the covers over my head. When they scanned over me, it electricaly shocked me. ⚡ They yelled ""found her! Found her!"" 

I fell back asleep. Right back into the dream I was having before Scout was puking. It was a dream about this man time traveling and bringing me back kids in the bed of a truck, covered in a blanket. The keys to the vehicle were visibly in the rear, left light. He says ""you usually break it to get them. Do you want me to this time?"" I didn't know what he was talking about. He walks over, kicks the light in and hands me the keys. He leaves. I go into auto pilot and start guiding the kid back to safety. While this is happening, some government agency starts searching my home. Evicts us from the property. I'm fighting to get our family and things out of there while it's taken over.  The man i fight with is in a black suit, grey/white hair, Military high 'n tight, pompadour in front.  He's comfortable fighting with me. Routine. Unphased. Shrugs off anything I say. Any laws I quote. Any demands for a warrant or legal demands. 

I wake up again. Thinking I must have dreamt about the scanning. Why would anyone want to ""find"" me? I'm nobody important. I just own a beauty lounge. I have no interesting affiliations. But my dream was in a different location. The dream house was in the woods.... The fear in my bed felt so real. The scanning felt like, what I imagine, a taser would feel like. I think to myself - if that had happened my dog would've been barking. I check Scout. She is not visibly breathing. I panic and start to shake her! She finally moves. Groans. Pukes on my bed again. I clean it up again. She wants to go outside. She runs around like normal. Does her business. Proceeds to play with our other dog as normal.

 My daughter had a sleepover and they are up ready for breakfast. Guess I'll proceed as normal.",Aliens? Dream? Both? IDK
aliens,"Inspired by a few Twilight Zone episodes. This is more of a thought experiment. Here’s my hypothesis: human beings are the product of convergent evolution on many planets throughout the cosmos. Not just humans, but dogs, cats, birds, fish… that each planet goes through its cycle of developing vertebrates and coming into land, and eventually gaining awareness and consciousness, building society, and so on? What if our natural cycle is not unique, but commonplace? 

Life began here in Earth almost as soon as it had a stable atmosphere and temperature. Depending on the formation of other planets, they could be worlds in which human beings don’t yet exist, or worlds in which humans are long since extinct. Obviously we are not the end result of the natural evolutionary cycle.

So, what would it take to disprove this hypothesis? What factors make it unlikely that the civilizations on other planets are just people like us? My mind immediately goes toward the nature of mass extinctions, but I want to hear what you guys think. 

Finally, I want to add that we will never be able to reach other star systems. Unless there is a radical revolution in medicine and physics, none of us will live to actually know what’s out there. So, at least for now, everything beyond our local space is entirely hypothetical space made of a psychological fabric. And that space is indeed populated with our hypotheses and imaginings, in the same way that monsters are real to a child.",Unpopular Hypothesis

aliens,"A few weeks ago I was listening to That UFO Podcast with an interview with Ross Coulthart.

On that Ross mentioned the notion of amnesty-driven disclosure.

On the Theories of Everything podcast with Curt, Lue Elizondo also agreed that this would be a sensible path to disclosure.

Since hearing this and thinking more about why this makes sense I slowly got obsessed with the idea. So, I started working on a doc that would scope out how something like this could happen and how I as an ordinary person could help make that happen.

One of the best ways I could think of was to shine a light on this as a possible solution as much as possible to create public and political discourse around this solution. With this in mind, I started working on how this could be approached from a marketing perspective and made the below. What you will see below is very basic and just the bare bones of how we, non-governmental folk could help contribute to the disclosure process.

So - below you'll find what I worked on so far. It's nothing amazing. But I wanted to make this post to ask if anyone out there wants to brainstorm on this sort of thing. If you do, let's chat! I have a Slack I just made and would be happy to invite any of you who are interested in making this happen. I'm also open to any feedback as, so please don't hold back if you think this is a stupid and a bad move! 🙏🏼

    ABOUT  

**What**  
Decades ago UFO programs were hidden from oversight. For true disclosure to occur it would mean that those presently in charge would need to come forward and accept the consequences and liabilities of years of governmental deceit. Given our built-in desires for self-preservation, this means that full disclosure will likely never happen. Therefore, providing amnesty for those in these rogue UFO organizations may be the only way to get genuine governmental level disclosure. Amnesty does not guarantee public disclosure, but it does seek to ensure that those in government who should be informed to make these decisions are informed. An amnesty solution retains full confidentiality of people and data. It is up to the appropriate governmental bodies to decide what can and should be released to the public. To help make this amnesty-driven disclosure a reality the #UFOAmnesty project aims to create political and public discourse on this.

**Why**

Currently, a major issue is that the public interest is fleeting. When these short bursts of interest occur the public’s energy and interest is not meaningfully utilized. Most people get started in this topic very interested, they then do nothing and mentally put the UFO topic away until the next news comes along. For the large majority of the public this cycle of excitement with new news and then no action repeats itself. This means that most of the public's interest is never developed or used. Those who could be activated for more action to help disclosure progression never end up contributing.

**How**

The #UFOAmnesty project aims to galvanize and activate the public interest through meaningful, viral campaigns with clear objectives and call to actions. This starts from creating a credible apolitical project that the general public can participate in without cost, and while minimizing social stigma.

As this push for UFO amnesty should be apolitical, (as it does support any one party, agenda, individual or group) it should be a mission where even the likes of Steven Greer and Lue Elizondo can give joint support. This should mean we can unify all parts of the UFO community, and more importantly the wider general public, under one mission that drives mass public actions in support of amnesty for rogue UFO programs.

    CREDIBILITY  

For any of our campaigns to have credibility, we must have an endorsement with legitimate people, specifically government-affiliated personnel. Without this, none of our campaign will not be taken seriously.

**See a list of government officials, respected journalists and academics that would be key here:**  
**➡️** [**https://airtable.com/shrHL18PX2klC3fDt**](https://airtable.com/shrHL18PX2klC3fDt) **⬅️**

    GOALS  

The 2 primary goals of this project will be:

**1.** Generate ongoing international public discussion of UFO’s via viral social media campaigns

**2.** Create political and public discourse for UFO amnesty

    STRATEGIES  

To achieve these 2 goals we will use 3 overarching strategies:

**1. Viral Social Media &amp; Physical Marketing Campaigns:**

* Think of campaigns like [#BlackOutTuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices)
* Global online efforts in co-ordinated social media and offline community marketing campaigns
* Using viral campaigns we achieve mass awareness and mass action (via clear CTA’s in campaigns)

**2. Effective Use Of Existing Public Interest:**

* **Free influencers:** Many celebrities/influencers will give free campaign exposure if used correctly. From the likes of Demi Lovato to Julius Dein (Facebook’s most-watched page), these celebrities have a genuine interest in UFO’s that we can capture to support campaigns for free - granting us billions in views and reach for free.
* **Mass Public Action:** Galavazing interest under singular mass public campaigns internationally. These could be political petitions, to media pitching or emails/letters to politicians. This also includes creating an easy-to-share an archive of links that include links to existing articles, interviews, videos and more to share with friends and family to make it easier for organic virality.

**3. Effective Use of All Media Types:**

* **Creating discourse regarding UFO technologies ability to solve climate &amp; energy issues**  

   * This is a topic not yet discussed which can activate eco-conscious activism &amp; new people
   * Increasing this awareness is a whole new way to reach a whole new segment of the public
   * We should also do this using partnership with organizations from the DiCaprio Foundation to secure the likes of sustainability icons such as David Attenborough &amp; Greta Thunberg
   * Pitching to eco journalists and those in climate science will also help secure coverage
* **New Media:** YouTube channels, podcasts, TikTok, meme pages, influencers
* **Traditional Media:** TV news, newspapers, magazines

&amp;#8203;

    Tactics:  

**Free Marketing Seeding**

To seed campaigns, we should be using existing UFO interest groups first. Initially, we can consider these across 3 major groups, including:

1. **The Hyper Engaged Community:**  
***Definition:*** These are the people who read UFO subreddits and are on UFO Twitter every day to read up on and potentially engage online in the topic. These people do intentional check-ins frequently on the subject. (Estimated 1%-5% of the UFO community)  
***Use:*** These are the people we can rely on for free initial grass-roots pushes, and potentially physical marketing. This includes for example mass pitching for coverage to journalists, news sites/social pages, TV shows, radio and vloggers. These groups eill also help with physical campaigns, for example - college campuses activation to activate Gen Z student activism.
2. **The Disengaged Community:**  
***Definition:*** These are people who were very interested initially, but through years of disappointment have become less engaged but are still interested in updates. With appropriate engagement, these can become members of The Hyper Engaged Community (Estimated 50-75% of the UFO community)  
***Use:*** These are the people we must update and re-energize. This should start with easy, low commitment things like viewing, liking and sharing. They should then gradually be funneled to more high level participation activities like signing petitions, posting on own socials etc
3. **The Interested Celebrities &amp; Influencers**  
***Definition:*** These are the public figures who have a genuine interest in the topic and so will offer free support if approached and activated correctly. This includes celebrities like Demi Lovato, Leonardo Dicaprio and Post Malone. This also includes digital celebrities/influencers, like large viral TikTokers and IG/FB influencers in all niches, from Logan Paul, to FAZE Clan and Joe Rogan.  
***Use:*** These are the people who will help us achieve free distribution to billions globally. To activate these they will be included in things like panel livestream AMA’s and pre-seeding campaigns if we do things like 1 day lead up viral events.

&amp;#8203;

    MARKERTING CAMPAIGN #1: Occupy 1 Day Globally  

Whether it be one of world's first viral activism campaigns like Kony 2012, or the more recent [#BlackOutTuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices) campaign, it’s clear that focusing public energy to 1-day can greatly increase the odds of participation. This can be explained in 2 main reasons:

1. **With everyone posting the same thing at once it becomes socially acceptable to do so.**  
For a regular campaign it’s hard anyway to get mass public engagement. Most people feel insecure about posting; worrying they won’t get likes or they’ll be judged for the opinion. Make it a UFO topic and it’s even harder due to the stigma. Therefore, having a day to activate everyone at once will greatly help people feel more comfortable in posting as they aren’t doing this alone at a random time. Instead they do it with thousands of others and well respected public figures.
2. **With everyone sharing at once it socially guilts you to not be involved - if the barrier to be involved is as simple as a Story share or signing of online petition and reposting the confirmation page.** People follow other people. If all your friends are posting on social media about a social justice campaign and you don’t - you’re the odd one one out who doesn’t care. Therefore, having one day where anyone can easily join with a few taps will increase the odds of success.
3. **Hype - The build up to the day, the excitement of being part of a movement together**
4. **Belief in the possibility of effecting change through participation**

If #UFOAmnesty uses the 1 day approach these would be some considerations:

1. **Assets:** Video and image assets must be prepped and provided for distribution to the community and optimized for each social. Ideally we should have 1 hero video posted everywhere that has a montage of the most credible media and ends with a clear CTA at the end. For example, this could start off with the FLIR footage, have cuts of reputable news stories quotes, articles and government personnel interviews internationally.  
The primary CTA at the end of this video should be to repost/retweet at the most basic level.  
The deeper level of CTA’s should be to sign petitions, and to attend the next day's livestream AMA where the global public has a chance to ask questions to the likes of Lue (if he’s on board with this), and other governmental advisors. Ideally we can use the day's hype to also encourage the world to join the next day on a livestream AMA with ideally the likes of Luis E, Christopher M, and other international government personnel who are comfortable being open about the UFO subject and are vetted, credible official personnel.
2. **Clear CTA’s:** Aside from asking for posting and retweeting of media, the campaign must also have different levels of engagement for more the different levels of motivated public participants. For example, pre-written tweets to Tweet local government representatives, to petition signatures. Some public participants will want to help as much as they can, whereas others will simply want to reshare online and not do more than that. For this reason we need to ensure we have 1 core CTA, but also secondary and tertiary CTA’s for those who want to help in as many ways as possible.
3. **Launch day strategy:** While the campaign should aim to build hype for maximum participation on the day of the campaign, we must also ensure we have strategies to find and capture those whose interest is sparked the most who can become part of “The Hyper Engaged Community”. For these people we must have active efforts to engage with those engaging in the campaign on the day. We must also have appropriate “nets” to identify and retain communication with these people for future pushes. This can be with email or phone sign ups, to follows on campaigns socials.
4. **Ongoing Campaigns:** There must be a developed strategy to appropriately capture the hype built on the day, and on the next day's livestream AMA. This should be done in mind to decide how best to maximize the hype and build the community for future campaigns.
5. **Recruitment -** We are only as good as the team. With this in mind, both during the campaign and ongoing we need to focus on recruitment as this is when hype will peak. Whether these are marketeers, scientists, politicians, teachers, students - whatever. We need a systematized way people can apply to volunteer help, then a method to meaningfully use all of this help and direct this activity.

&amp;#8203;

    MARKETING ASSET #1: UFO Beginners Guide  

To help introduce the UFO topic to those new to the subject we must create a shareable directory of news that people can easily share with friends, family and social media followers.

This directory be organized so that if someone prefers video, article, or podcast format they can easily find the content they prefer. The directory must also be searchable and only have hard journalism.

All communication should be done via Slack. Join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/ufoamnesty/shared_invite/zt-ydsitsh0-3aDnS0ul4eqA3wWIsV2S4Q)

    Scientific Community Outreach  

* Mass outreach using a mixture of scraping and manual outreach methods to universities, focusing first on science or political departments for student campaign engagement
* Can run outreach through LinkedIn and Twitter (students and professors). Automation can help if needed. This can be a scalable, targeted way of reaching specific scientific disciplines with info
* Can do mass outreach to students of specific science disciplines via their school/courses official pages, but also their related meme pages.

aliens,"Forgive me for such a convoluted heading but it is the basis for the reasoning of this current train of thought of mine.

Often fueled by the preconceived notions of popular culture and the like, we have been spoon-fed the simplicity of the notion of a civilization far more superior than us ""simply"" being more superior than us in terms of technology.

Technology could be considered a rather relatively rudimentary term, as Arthur C Clarke put it: ""*Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*"". In whatever context we may put it, technology is a material thing, even if it so far surpasses our own that we might consider it magical. 

Technology is one thing. But far less have we considered the *societal* impacts beyond the fact that *they* simply are more technologically advanced than we are. It may be beyond the realms of our understanding, but it could be for our best to consider a wider potential of the existence of another intelligent civilization, beyond the realms of what can be achieved by *material* things. 

You might ask, ""*how can we even broach such a concept?*"", but the fact that you might consider such a question worth asking means you're on the right track.

A word that is often thrown around is ""Disclosure"".  It is a collective buzzword of sorts, meaning different things to different people. But for the most part, it represents the moment when the world at large is aware that we are in fact not alone in the universe. And that's where we often stop our thinking.

It may in fact be host to a number of humbling, possibly unwelcome, graver truths which we may or may not be ready to face, individually or universally. Of course, these points have been raised many times before, but it bears repeating. Some examples:

* Public awareness of the existence of other civilizations in the universe (before potential pre-set conditions are met) results in the destruction of said civilization, requiring tactics such as disinformation to quell public knowledge of the phenomenon. This would in fact favor the conceived cover up of knowledge of the phenomenon, as it would prolong the existence of our species. So in fact, furthering Disclosure is furthering our demise.
* Our entire society have been tampered with from the beginning.
* We are an ant farm kind of planet, bred as nothing more as an experiment.
* There exists a galactic alliance of sorts with many different civilizations, but Earth is considered a cesspool.
* There exists other dimensions, and travel between those are possible.
* Time travel is possible.
* Reincarnation is real, what we consider our human bodies are not the real 'us'. How much faculty over your own body do you even possess, when you *really* think about it? 
* Our reality is not real. We only live in a simulated universe.

... Or anything we might not have even begun to theorize. As I said, anything revealed by ""Disclosure"" will be humbling. But just *how* humbling remains to be seen, but it might be a good idea to be prepared to think of '**life**' bigger in scope than we might have ever dreamed to consider. It might not just be as simple as a nuts and bolts flying saucer from Zeta Reticuli. We might very well in fact have to re-evaluate the very existence of *existence*.",The knowledge of the existence of another sentient species in our perceived universe in itself is not the most extraordinary fact that comes from such a revalation

aliens,"Allow me to explain what I originally wanted to describe in title in order to make my point more clear, as it requires some background comprehension of psychology.

So I have been dwelling into psychology for the past few months and due to my long time love and interest in extraterrestrial life, it was only a matter of time before they were able to meet ways and create a new hypothesis. For those of you who don't know, one of the main components that define pretty much the entirety of neurological systems in terrestrial life is happiness; that is, the desire to pursue actions that makes us happy and have clear chemical equivalents for the reasons that lead us to commit those acts. Life evolved to search for the biggest amount of happiness with the least amount of energy investment required, as it is not only evolutionary advantageous to have a drive to do things (or nothing would get done and the species goes extinct) and employ the least amount of energy required for such purpose to preserve more of it, only acting in those instances were the happiness or danger output is bigger than the investment.

Taking into consideration this, wouldn't it be possible that most aliens and, quite frankly a strecht, all sufficiently advanced life share the same protocols? They might have differences in how they express those desires and areas assigned to the body to them according to their own enviroments, but there are no other emotions that could become prevalent as they are either reliant in happiness to exist (for example an ""anger based psychology"" without interest in something would just be destructive, not to mention that anger is originally triggered in those instances when happiness is prevented) or would lead to the appearence of models that arent advantageous in an ecosystem that will demand a constant interest in both survival and the methods required to adquire as such.

This has led me to wonder about the possibility of all socially advanced aliens following this psychology, as the main aspects required for the presence of communal organizations is reliant on some key factors, such as empathy (that can only exist when an individuals finds the wellbeing of another has a method to achieve an even bigger degree of happiness, with evolution favouring those who could create the stronger bonds and place interest in the community for obvious reasons) among others.

While this doesn't seem to constitute a big issue, the idea that some psychological reactions are universal provides me with both a warm and dissapointing feeling, as it would be interesting to see alternate models as methods of study. Still, the possibility that sadness -express when an individual submits to the general factors of an enviroment that prevent happiness- or in a more joyful tone, laughter -triggered when an individual seeks to define if it will be able to adquire happiness without any input being required in those instances where a state of any degree of alert may be needed, hence why we usually laugh when someone can recognize the main issues or problems that we face as it provides us with a figure who can perform the input required to either guard or help us against them- is something that would be extremely interesting and gives me a feeling similar to the one I had as a child, wondering about the universe as a place where there are constants beyond the ones of physics.

Discuss!","Taking into consideration the clear evolutionary advantages of happiness, could the bases of human psychology be ""universal""?"

But we want to believe. Remove all the fiction, the supernatural, and the craziness. When we keep it scientific, if there is indeed a lifeform out there that has the ability to harness energy in some way which allows them to travel anywhere, and they show up...

That would be the most mindblowing thing ever. I hope something like that happens in my lifetime. Even if it were to ultimately end in our devastation, holy shit would it have throw a spanner in the works! Nothing would ever be the same again on Earth on that first major encounter. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is such an incredibly giant mindblowing and exciting thing to think about for me, and the thing is, maybe it is even a possibility. I think it may be the biggest incredible thing we could potentially witness, that is also on the edge of possible reality. Something more of a possible reality than things like as gods, ghosts, demons etc, etc. 

One of the reasons is, that we just don't know the limitations of our science. We could be unbelievably far away from the possiblities. If we survive 10's of thousands of more years, maybe even millions, our technology could be completely and utterly discernable from what we have today. Who knows the limitations and what we might uncover.

aliens,"Imagine this scenario: 

Aliens are creating a hybrid race to take over control of the planet from regular humans. They want to keep our ecocystems intact because this will be the hybrid habitat. Instead of ""takeover"", you can also call it ""assimilation"", since a hybrid can be seen as an altered human.

* Nukes: prevent global destruction of the habitat. They increased their attention after the first nuclear explosions
* Hybrids: to introduce telepathy into society, to:
   * take control of human power structures
   * bring these under control of alien power structures (maybe like an insect caste system)
   * be able to understand multiplanet/multidimensional interactions
   * be able to understand earth organisms and ecosystems better
   * have a common goal
* UFO's near military places: keep an eye on latest tech, be ready for intervention to prevent escalation
* Extreme secrecy: takeover and hydrid program cannot be done by force, so must remain secret. The aliens have done it many times before, and have it down to an exact science with almost flawless protocols. They are working against the clock of nuke proliferation, overpopulation, ecosystem collapses
* Takeover stages:
   * research human biology
   * select a similar (previously assimilated) species from another planet to use for hybridization
   * create iterations (generations) of hybrids til they are suitable for earth habitats
   * infiltrate society, reproduce (or perhaps reproduction is under control of the caste system, and only ""siblings"", offspring of a ""queen"" are allowed)
   * take over / replace nontelepaths

aliens,"With all this Starseed and the Pleiadians talk going on in most Alien/UFO spaces/communities. I see that people turn the belief in aliens into a new religion or some form of new-age spirituality or something. I have noticed that for a long time now. Where the Pleiadians are some angel-like light beings here to protect humanity. While the Reptilians are demonic-like creatures here to feed off human energy. It's funny that these beautiful beings called the Pleiadians are associated with so much positivity. While the unattractive Reptilians are associated with so much negativity. A classic human flaw or error is exposed here. That flaw or error is pretty privileged and just exposed. Leave it to human beings to use the halo effect on otherworldly beings lol.

Anyways im rambling here a bit. But when I think spirituality I think of new-age vegan hippies who love/worship nature or none religious people who don't like labels but still believe in a higher power. So when I think about spirituality. People who think they are descendants of starseeds/Pleiadians and can use spiritual CE5 ish magic to communicate with Aliens. Is not the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about spirituality LMAO.

The funny thing is. People are always saying how dumb humans are. That they can't understand how Alien technology work. Because Alien technology is something our tiny brains can't understand like how Ants can't understand humans. So we can't understand the concept of their Alien technology.

But the hypocrisy comes in when we can somehow understand the spirituality Aliens have but we can't understand their technology 🤔. You would think the way Aliens would view the meaning of life would be another concept our tiny brains can't understand too. In the same way, we can't understand their technology. But somehow some humans on Earth think they know everything about Aliens when it comes to their spirituality. At the end of the day, it's really their own version of spirituality. They are making Aliens the Gods, Angels, and Demons in their worldview because Aliens are the perfect target for people to be immortalized for some reason I guessed.

Spirituality should be something exclusive to Earth or certain cultures. Just like how many religions like Christianity and Islam are exclusive to Earth cultures.

In conclusion

I don't understand why a whole universe filled with billions of possible Alien races needs to be tied or limited to the way some people view spirituality and Aliens. By making it look like both are the same thing. What makes us so special that we can spiritually tap into Aliens with CE5 magic. When this universe could possibly be filled with life. I'm sure Alien spirituality doesn't revolve around us lol.",When did Aliens and Spirituality become so interchangeable? Why do people think Spirituality and Aliens are the same things?

aliens,"When I was a child, I had a multitude of ""events"" that would happen in my father's old two-story house within a small town, after my parents got divorced when I was young, (7 Y/O).   

My first true experience I ever had was when I was 9,  I had a small bright red alarm,  at the time it was approximately 1AM, right before winter settled in.

 As I woke up, my room was brightened with a Green light coming through my windows. The light isn't what awoke me. WHAT WOKE ME WAS THE SOUNDS OF CHIRPING BIRDS. At first it I could barely hear them, but the pitch kept elevating and became almost ear piercing, I Dont remember how long it was, all I remember is being so scared I hid underneath the blankets until the sound went away. It was a long time.  When the sound was gone the light also left the room I was staying in.

2nd experience 

(Took place when I was 11) 
My brother and I were staying in an adjacent room within our house, I woke up in the middle of the night from the TV turning on (it being static) and a projection of a 2d ""dinosaur""  coming from a blue light projected into the room,  the projection was REAL, I remember the fear of how REAL it was, it created no noise outside of the TV static. It also did not leave until I forced myself to hide underneath the blankets, it was for sure at least an hour of it occupying my room.   I never understood what it's goals were, or its intentions. My brother wasn't awake for this, I don't know how.

These were just the main two occurrences outside of my clothes/items disappearing,  tvs turning on and off to wake me in the middle of the night, on multiple occasions, my mother and I seeing a UFO in the sky while driving home, (her house was in the countryside, since we lived in the midwest) and the general feeling of always being watched, especially at night.

aliens,"Hey folks. Long time lurker of Reddit in general. I’ve got a small experience I’d like to share and see what you all think. I’m nearly 30 and this happened a year ago. Looking to see your thoughts on this. I’ve googled my experience and it’s lead to aliens, so here I am to report it.

Setting: AZ, USA. I live in the valley in the suburbs. 
My bed sits 3ft from my patio door, which has floor length blackout curtains, the patio leads to my backyard. I sleep heavy, it’s caused me problems, I use a Cpap. My partner is a light sleeper, me getting out of bed in the morning wakes her up. Trying to give as much context as you may need.

One night I wake up out of the blue, which truly never happens. I turn off my Cpap, get up out of bed and pace around for a bit wondering what woke me up; I do recall feeling that there was a reason I woke up, but I couldn’t understand why. That is not fluff, and I felt I should mention that. Still, could be nothing. The time is 3:04 or 3:07

After standing and pacing for about a minute with my hands on my hips, I hear a VERY loud humming. It quite literally sounds like my head is in a running microwave. I couldn’t tell the direction it was coming from, it sounded like it came from all around me. I look over to my partner and wonder if it’s woken her up, it hasn’t. 

I get the feeling there’s something outside so I walk to my patio door, grab the curtain and prepare to open it and peek. I ended up standing there with my hand on the curtain for roughly 3 minutes unable to pull the curtain back. I still hear the humming, but I keep going back and forth in my mind telling myself “I don’t need to look outside/ it’s nothing/ I should go back to sleep” as well as “yes, I think something is outside/ I want to open the curtain and look”. I can’t explain it, and it really bothers me. I kept thinking to myself wondering why I’m struggling to make up my mind, and why can’t I just open the damn curtain, I know that I’m awake, I am conscious and aware in this moment.

Then the humming stops, and I open the curtain - nothing is out there, and go back to bed. The next day I wake up and google the humming and see a ton of report of people saying their experience with close up ufo encounters sound like this.


Anyways, there it is. I’m sure it’s wordy, I apologize. I would just like some feedback please. I have no previous  mental diagnosis, history of sleep walking,m. I know I was awake and what I experienced was real. Thank you for reading.","Sharing an (small) auditory and physical experience, maybe one of you can help. Looking for possible answer."

its not that these people are dumber than us, or are just being dismissive assholes. it’s because they don’t want it to be true. they would rather take the blue pill, than acknowledge the fact that we are legitimately being visited by aliens. 

imagine learning that everything you have been taught; history, religion, science and the human condition - it was all a lie. i don’t think people, including myself and others into UFO and alien stuff, are truly grappling with the implications of all this.

aliens,"**CONGRESSIONAL UPDATE:** In Congress, the UAP action is now in the U.S. Senate -- and on Nov. 4, 2021, there occurred what could prove to be a very important development.

Some will recall that in September the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, H.R. 4350), including a groundbreaking section of UAP-related mandates, authored by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), on which I reported in detail at the time.

The U.S. Senate is likely to take up the NDAA within weeks. Leaders of the armed services and intelligence committees in both houses hope to see the legislation enacted before the end of the year.

On November 4, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) filed a proposed UAP-focused amendment to the NDAA that goes far beyond the House-passed Gallego UAP language. If enacted -- which will take some doing -- the Gillibrand Amendment would require the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community to greatly increase the level of priority, coordination, and resources that they direct to investigating UAP, and to annually share at least part of what they know or learn with the American people. 

I break it all down in a detailed analysis on my blog, along with the entire text of the Gillibrand Amendment, and the names of the key lawmakers who will hammer out the final UAP language that becomes law (if any does)-- check it out.

aliens,"I'm looking to get in touch with the right people who can make use of the information I have documented of a flying saucer craft.

I'm looking for ways to contact agency's that can make use of the information I have recorded of a couple incidents concerning a daytime flying saucer in a major city. It appeared near the international airport as well as raytheon, and general dynamics Canada.

It looked like a bronze and silver courogated lampshade with a glowing gold or yellow cone on the top. It did't reflect sunlight and had no lights, it was a solid object that popped in did some insane CNC looking manoeuvres without acceleration or deceleration at a steady constant speed. Stopped on a dime then faded away. The whole event took about 3 seconds. This happened in the middle of a large city near an international airport, Raytheon, and general dynamics Canada.

I hope this story can reach the right person so that I can answer some questions of my own one day. if anyone can help me pass this story on to someone that might be that kind of person I would greatly appreciate it.

I documented some files of the incident that took place in 2008 in Calgary, AB, Canada. I live in Canada, However I'm unaware of a Canadian equivalent to the UAPTF. The UAPTF is a very recent program, that is why I have decided to post this now.

The Folder Contains

* 2 audio files About an hour each of interviews to be sure I recorded the story of the incident(s). The Incidents are described in great detail, as well as the event that acted as a catalyst for the incidents to occur.

* A brief Note recording the exact coordinates angle and approximate size of the object. date and times.

* Several map pins illustrating the location and distance of the witness to the craft in the first event and the vehicle in the second event. The location of the Raytheon and General Dynamics Canada facilitys Directly below where the craft appeared. The heliport location that the Chopper from the 2nd incident has taken off from and returned to (most likely could be verified by someone with the clearance)

* Historic records of the weather to support the date and times of the incidents.

* an illustration of the craft

* 1 photo and 1 blueprint style illustration to detail the chopper to distinctly identify the vehicle in the second event.

My main goal is to gain more insight into what occurred, and learn more. I have the overwhelming sense that I may never achieve this goal.

My personal feelings are of crushing disappointment at my own failure and inability learn more about this situation or others like it. My apologies in advance for wasting anyone's time here, that is not my intent.

Thank you for Reading this, as well as for your time and consideration.

That said, is there any sort of online database that compiles all of the evidence he claims to have? Or is it considered too ""top secret"" and would be ""murdered"" for disclosing it? I find it odd that I can't seem to find any documentation other than that which has been officially declassified.

aliens,"it all started when i was cooking a meatloaf for easter. i was sitting in my living room. bored out of my mind. all of a sudden the wife walks into the room and asks if i gave the children their allowance yet, stupid bitch wife... i said no and told her to fuck off, i went into the kitchen to grab a cold one, and would you believe it, there was no more modello! i ran upstairs and grabbed my gun. i left the house and hopped in my car. it was time to get some beer. (and cigarettes!) you cant have a beer without a cigarette! anyways, i pulled up at the local gas station and told that bitch to open the cash register, he said there was no more money because some dude robbed him seconds earlier. i negotiated with him and told ""listen up bitch, dont snitch on me and ill kill that guy for you. i get 90 percent, and you get 10%"", he said fine. anyways, i drove up to that mofo, and he pulls out a machine gun! the sneaky little weasel he is! son of a gun almost shot my limited edition walter white-breaking bad action figure's head off! i managed to get a good shot on his tires. his car halted to a stop. at which point, i pursued him on foot. he dropped the duffel bag and asked me to spare his life. what the hell does he think i am? he would have killed my family, if i let him go! so i got a bike lock and locked him to a lamp post. i then proceeded to feed him sandwiches and i gave him beer right before left him there. and he said to me, right as i left, ""hey! see this? (points at the bike lock), i wouldn't do this to my worst enemy."" then i drove away. i came back to the gas station, and walked inside. the guy said "":O i cant believe it! thank you!"" then i knocked him out and left with 100% of the money. i even stole the beer and cigarettes. i returned home and my wife makes a potato salad! dumb potato bitch wife... god bless her soul. anyways, i sat on the couch and put on my favorite show. bill nye! the show was boring as hell, so i had to change it. i put on spongebob and laughed my ass off! arr mr squidward! get back to work! anyways, i went to the oven and saw that the meatloaf was burnt! i went over to the living room and said ""WHAT THE HELL KAREN!? YOU DIDNT EVEN KEEP AN EYE ON THE MEATLOAF?"" and i slapped that bitch in the mouth! the events that ensued after are as follows: three cop cars pull up at my doorstep. and they pull out their guns and say ""get out here! with your hands behind your head! and no one will be hurt!"" i wasnt going to die yet! i pulled out my machine gun from under the floorboards and started shooting at the cops! it was like ""BANG BANG"", i killed them all... great. now another problem to deal with. i just threw their bodies into the ocean at the local beach. this one guy was giving me bad looks. like a dead stare... so i showed him the business! i smashed his head on the sand and blasted his brains over the walls of the consession stand behind him. on my way back to my house to watch some spongebob, my landlord shows up and says ""bitch! why havent you paid your rent in 9 months!?"", i started running but he knows martial arts, and kung fu, so he powerbombed me into the bushes and suplexed me into the ground! i thought this was it... but it wasnt! i got all the courage i had, and killed my landlord. so the kids come back from school, and their teacher sends me a message saying ""your son was being disruptive in class today! he was making odd noises such as""EEEEUUUURRRRUUGHGHGGGHHH"" and ""SCREEEEEEK!"", and he showed up unfit to attend school, mofo was lookin greener than shrek"" to which i asked my son, who wasnt green at all, why were you being disruptive? he said""i sent my pet lizard to take my place while i deal drugs on the mean streets"" fair enough. my daughter asked where her teddy bear went, so i put up missing posters of the teddy bear. eventually i saw some creep stroking the missing posters, and saying ""oh teddy, we will soon be together.. when i can sniff you all i want!"", turns out some creep was sniffing her teddy! AAAARGH! so i gave him an atomic wedgie, and stapled his underwear to the lamp post, and spread some hair grow gel on his chin so he would look like the local criminal ""Howard Gethesmaine"". the police picked him up the next day and declared him dead. whoever this howard gethesmaine guy is, i must have done him a big favor, cause the cops aren't searching for him anymore. i went to sleep at about 9:00 (im a good boi) and i woke up in the middle of the night, when i saw the roof floating in the middle of the air, and me being lifted out of bed! by an alien spacecraft! i called for my stupid wife, but the aliens told me to be quiet in a strange language! so i did. theres no telling what these freaks can do! i passed out. i wake up in the craft, with four tall beings operating on me. i cant tell what they were saying, and i may never know, but i could've sworn i understood them! they said something like ""get the nose plunger and the stalium nolonatar! his farts are going to kill us! this one is really ugl"" and the rest became unintelligable. anyways, they get the stalium nolonatar, and its this giant speaker! they bring it up to my ear, and start saying ""TESTING TESTING!"" in alien language, as my eardrums explode, and i get up and say ""hey whats going on?"" and they say ""UMBLA GUMBLEFLOMBLE!"" as they run away. they hold their hand up and make the start trek spock symbol to the hand scanner, and the door opens. i get up and my head hurts like a buttcheek on a stick... i limp my way to the door that says ""GLAMSHNUMBLE PAPPARATOO"" id rather go into that room as opposed to the ""MUSSOLINI RESURRECTION CHAMBER"" there were weird noises that sounded like pasghetti coming from that room. so i hold my hand up and do the spock thing, and the son of a gun (the door) opens! i walk in and there are so many aliens guns, which i picked up one of each. which were deceptively light to carry!, so i see this obvious door hidden in the wall  and i kick it down. there were aliens behind it! i say ""explain this to me: whats going on?"" and they say, that they love cheese and were trying to kidnap all of the cows on planet earth! so i left and made my way to the docking station. i looked at the window as a beautiful landscape lay before my eyes. i snapped this pic of it since i had my trusty polaroid camera on me. i then got on a ship and said to the a.i. - SHMALEXA TAKE ME TO EARTH! and shmalexa said ""i shmdont shmknow shmwhat you shmamean by TAKE ME TO EARTH! "" so i said the same thing with smha before every word. i was back at earth and the meatloaf was burned to a crisp. what a shit.

I'm not saying it's aliens, it is most likely that someone of terrestrial origin put it there for one reason or another, however I would be interested to hear peoples thoughts and theories

it is reported that it is located in a very remote area that is really only accessible by air, so it does raise a few questions;

~ How did they get it there? it must weigh a fair bit and be hard to transport due to size

~ With no foot traffic or any populous likely to ever come across it or ever see it, it would seemingly make displaying it as an art piece rather pointless? 

~ To make, transport and organize this it would have cost considerable money, again what is the motive if it was likely to never be found? 

~ Though it's been likened to a film, is doesn't take any particular recognisable shape, just a rectangular slab, so the likeness could be coincidental, again for me weakening the art piece hypothesis

aliens,"To begin I want everyone reading this to understand that the intention of this post is to educate you on the history of this particular type of EBE.


The oldest credible type of EBE is found in the roswell testimonial accounts which claim that the beings found there and taken were short greys. Which were the size of children with black eyes and bulbous heads.

This type was re-enforced with the then claim of Betty and Barney Hill who also say they witnessed beings who were short and grey. Travis Walton has also claimed during his abduction the beings who captured him were short with large heads. Lonnie Zamora who witnessed a ufo landing and then the occupants claimed they were like short children in jumpsuits. 

The point of all of these reports is the consistency with the type of EBE being reported from the 40's forward. By people who provide evidence and outside testimonials.

So where does the Pleiadens/ Nordic/ Tall Whites come into play? They first appear in 1957 with a man named Antonio Villas Boas. He claimed he was abducted by ETs who were 5 feet tall and had blue eyes. He also makes it clear that their uniforms and not their skin were grey. He then says that a female ET was brought into a room with him which like the others had blue eyes. But unlike the others this one had platinum blonde hair. He has never produced a single bit of evidence of this and has had 0 other witnesses.


The second account and the man who truly popularized this EBE type is a hoaxer named Billy Meier. Meier makes claims that way back in 1942 he was being contacted but of course he provides 0 evidence of this. He claims female Nordic ETs taught him all of his knowledge including his supposed prophetic insights. He showed pictures he supposedly took of past events of earth and other planets. He also claimed to capture a photo of the Nordic ET that taught him so much. He was debunked years ago by various people. His photos were taken from historical books and TV shows. To this day he still claims to be the reincarnation of Jesus and Muhammad.

So if I remember correctly, Lue Elizondo, during an interview mentioned something about intelligent life forms living in different frequencies of light/IR or light frequencies. I just know the discussion was about intelligence and where they might be, he said something about here, but not here, and then mentioned IR and frequencies.   


If you go to this document, at the very end it talks about where they might be, starts talking about infrared and then when you go to the next page, it is cut off.....

The video I took this from is [here](https://youtu.be/iBT9xldEYz0?t=1961). 

The man on the right, the guest, is Emil Strainu, he used to be a general. [Here is his Wiki](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Str%C4%83inu)

He's becoming known as "" the daddy of all conspiracies "" as he was dubbed in a previous episode of the same show.

The man goes into a lot of various topics, including UFO's, like shown here.

As we have established, what I explained in the original post, turned out to be a lie. He said he had "" experts "" look at this and tell him, and I quote "" Are you sure you want to know what this represents? "" "" It's a depiction of our earth, being flat, in a dome "" and then goes on about the Vimanas and the bullshit.

This made me a little worried, because, he WAS a general, but he's talking out of his goddamn ass, at least about this image.

At this time they should still be traceable, this phenomenon started somewhere in 2006 but probably way earlier as there are different generation Hybrids. They are recognizable the way they ask questions and want to keep learning how to be like us.  
A few points where you can recognize a hubrid is, their eyes glow a bit more because of neuron capabilities, eyes are usually bit wider apart then us, have slightly larger eyes, ask dumb questions and a lot of them, for instance:

What purpose does it serve  
What are the set of rules.  
Who get's to decide.  
Who get's to choose.  
I mentioned in my earlier post that I found a website that looked really suspicious and this article I recently found on it looks like a gold mine: [https://www.reference.com/world-view/function-television-228b2aa5fad00843](https://www.reference.com/world-view/function-television-228b2aa5fad00843)

aliens,,RARE Documentary UFO
aliens,"Man I have been doing ENDLESS hours of study. Research and listening to Witness testimonies from high ranking officers of the military. 

In my opinion the most credible person to me so far. Is Dr. Steven Greer. Not only has he been at this a very long time. But he's getting very credible people to talk about very incredible things. But his take is one of much darker, nefarious plans. 

And his take on the To The Stars Academy and Luiz is that they are working for government and trying to control the narrative of what these aliens are and if they are hostile. 

I am a US citizen. But I'll tell you one thing. Our government is as shady as it comes. As greedy as it comes. And will do ANYTHING for thier own personal gain. So as far as them devising a plan to stage a false flag operation with the re-engineered crafts they have. To try to unite the world in a single cause of war against aliens is by far VERY plausible on many levels. And that's sad to say the least. I love my country. The ideals it was founded on. But anyone with a brain can see there's secret people running top secret things with bad intentions. 

One thing we have seen is all these encounters do not seem to suggest any of the alien or inner dimensional beings are hostile or harmful in any way. Like us I assume they are not only curious. But scared of what we can do. Clearly they are very concerned about our nuclear weapons. Rightfully so. We have little knowledge on exactly how badly the impact of splitting the atom is. And what it might mean for other dimensions. 

We have ALWAYS been a species hell bent on war... Why? Since the dawn of time. First things we made was weapons and armor. Things to stab one another with and shoot arrows at another. Why? Is this every species evolution process? Or only some? None the less humans are immensely destructive and anyone who disagrees is so blind it's unreal. Look how we treat figh and animals? With no remorse slaughtering them for small gains. We don't care for the damage we cause? Only the gain of power and wealth that comes of it. 

What's scary is that there's certain sociopaths that control the world. Control to tech. Control the media and narrative. Its hard to believe what's real. And what's being purposely force fed down our throats by false governmental people. And God isn't that frustrating that LITERALLY nothing you know can be real true or false. It's so hard to tell. That means they are succeeding at thier plans. To confuse. 

I believe our conscious goes much deeper then we use it for. That humans like these alien creatures can do much more then we think. And that ego and pride stand in our way. The truth is no one understands consciousness in depth at all and the possibilities it beholds. 

But what if the further we dive into a world of technology. The further we stray from the beauty of consciousness? Maybe the native Americans had it right. One with the earth. One with animals one with everything. 

We created laws that didn't exist to understand a existence we live in. I don't think time is real. Or linear. But all one fluid motion happening at once. Yet for us to live and understand this dimension we created time to allow us to do so and preview it as linear.

When I first delved into this topic. I didn't expect to go down a road that went this far. That drew these kinds of possibilities. I was very grounded in this reality and dismissed dimensions. And all that as folklore or theories. 

But the further I went. The more I listened to high ranking officials. People who worked at Lockheed and Martin and in Skunk Works and all over. The more my mind opened to the possibility that anything is possible. But I also understand why it's gonna be so hard to make billions of people open thier minds. Open thier consciousness to this universe. 

I think humans are what holds humans back. And this pre dated love for war? And wanting to have bigger and badder weapons then our counterparts is child's play. Outright primitive thinking. War has done nothing but destroy. There's no beauty in that. But there's money? Amd what you think makes governments like America run? Money and war. It's no secret we spend more then anyone on our militaries defense. 

I can't wait until we break these barriar of wanting conflict. It's pointless. Arbitrary to say the least. If we as a species came together. And put all our resources and minds to space and peace and love. I gaurentee we would have accomplished much more long ago then still being racially divided. 

Look around. America is as divided as ever. Arguing about things that are so minuscule in the grand picture of things. I really worry people. That the ones who run these programs. That have these crafts. Are setting up for a extinction level event. And as someone who has a beautiful 5 yr old daughter. I've found myself heavily invested in researching and finding out more. 

Call me crazy. That's exactly what they want. It's so easy to divide us with media and politics. I might not be spot on. But clearly something is happening on levels we cannot comprehend because of secrets. Some men think they are so special they get to hold the awsners of humanity. And steer us as a species. Those men are the smallest minded ones. 

A real man shares this. Helps us as a species. Sure maybe we cheated. But re-engineering crafts. Many have said tech like Night Vision, Fiber optics and CPU chips came from these craft. Makes sense. When you look at the time like of everything. It connects. From the atom bombs. Which clearly got us attention on a universal scale. Maybe even dimensional one. To the crash at or near roswell which guess what? Right next to where we tested the bombs. Coincidence? No. To the tech that we started created a decade after. Cause of course it took time to figure out thier tech. That wasn't gonna be some instant thing. 

Ever wonder why we advanced so fast compared to the previous thousands of years? It's not like all the sudden we just ""understood"" our reality. We had help. Accidental or not. It happened. It's been 70 years of cover ups. The fact many of these men talk about MULTIPLE alien species. Is insane. Not just 1. But many. And I'm sure they work together. 

Why? Cause Look at us? Different countries. So what we do? We made the united nations. They would do the same thing just on a planetary scale. That makes logical sense to me. 

Until this topic stops being seen as foolish. Which is billions of Disinformation works from our government to make it that way. Make the people think it's stupid and childish so no one will take anyone who whistle blows seriously. Great plan. But your proving exactly why humans are a issue. Why do we think that's ok? Why are we lying constantly. When we could have transcended long ago?

Because there's people who are rich with everything to lose. If we stop using fossil fuels. Some of the most powerful people will lose it all. And they can't have that. So instead they will continue out track of destruction and peril just so they can continue to have power and wealth. What a sad way to see it. And disgusting human ethics they have. I only hope these alien species know not all humans are like this. Driven by power and wealth. But instead are for love. Peace. Exploration and curiosity. 

Steven Greer has done some exceptional work. Talked to some experienced experts. And as of now ? He's the guy that I believe in most. Not Luiz. Mr counter intelligence. His whole job is to steer us from the truth people. And the whole TTSA is called the ""rat pack"" by inside pentagon sources. 

For anyone interested. I suggest heavily to look into Steven Greer. Listen to what he says. The evidence he has. The testimonies he's collected. Very compelling and mind altering stuff.",Agendas behind governmental cover ups especially US.

.... Further, in these unhappy times, there will be unbridled luxury which will ensnare the rest into sin and conquer innumerable frivolous souls who will be lost. Innocence will almost no longer be found in children, nor modesty in women.""

Tom Delonge said that these aliens are more spiritual rather than physical and that the natural state of things are unnatural and we are being manipulated. (satan).

Luis Elizonde bosses said "" Elizondo asked where his boss was going with the non sequitur before acknowledging familiarity with the Good Book. As per Elizondo, he was then told, “‘Well, then you would know that these things are demonic and we should not be pursuing them.’ He wasn’t kidding. That’s exactly how he felt.”

There are also many more apparitions of mary and jesus which are pretty interesting:

In alien abductions testimonies says that invoking the name of jesus or a higher power scares them away too.

Apparition of dozule: [http://trinite.1.free.fr/english/english.htm](http://trinite.1.free.fr/english/english.htm) \- talks about the end times are here 1970 and that the book of life has been opened - referring to revelations)

(Jesus tells us to pray the Prayer of Dozule with a decade of the rosary and that his sign (the cross) is there and that the book of life is opened - referring to Revelations) - praying this comes with benefits!

What do you guys think? These aliens are demons masquarading in alien form or really are aliens from a different planet?

aliens,"Yes it is. This happened and I'll tell you as I can remember it, as it was over 35 years ago now. 

I was a salesman in Wellington, New Zealand. My territory took in the plum streets that major corporations and govt departments sat on, plus some streets that were considered ""worthless' in terms of what I was selling. 

Anyway, the dud area had a lovely little park in it called Pigeon Park (for obvious reasons). It was triangle in shape and there was enough room to sit with friends with a road either side. 

I'm looking at the businesses, and yep, they were not my target. All retail on ground level and above that maybe apartments, or small businesses. 

I'm having lunch looking at one of the buildings and I see a guy standing in the window and he looks like he's looking directly at me. 

He's about 50 metres away on the second floor of this building. He waves

I don't, because I don't know if he's waving at me

He waves again and signals with the come to me hand gesture.

Odd. Wonder if he knows me,I thought? I'd finished lunch so I crossed the road and entered the narrow stairway up the steep flight of stairs. This would be an early 1900s building.

At the top of the stairs is a large open warehouse type room that stretched the entire length of the room and offices at the far end. There was loads of old dusty stuff on long tables. It made me immediately think of a drapery type business.

The guy was an oddball. I didn't know him, he didn't know me, but he said he felt he had to meet me for some reason.  Now, I never felt uncomfortable, because this guy was a professorial looking type. Cardigan with jacket, unkempt hair, woolen tie.

I asked him what he did and he gave a vague answer about helping his clients...with specialist work, whatever that meant, I laughed and said, like an accountant?
No, in a bookbinder. Seems his clients were almost all international and he got to fix some rare books...

So I said,  this is a vwry expansive space you've got here...for a book bindery, which I presumed was in the office rooms at the back, to which (and this is where it gets weird) he replied...""yes, I bought it 7 years ago to witness the event...""

Oooh, so what events that then?

He said ""the arrival of the 7 beings. He believed (so strongly, he bought the whole floor of this commercial building) that 7 alien beings were coming to earth. When they arrived they would each land a circular ring type space ship, one on top to the other. These would form some form of intergalactic university offering free transfer of their knowledge of the universe.

One of the many thousands of sites around the world was the one and only Pigeon Park and he bought this property so he could get a front row seat of the proceedings when they arrived.

Now, I can tell you, my mouth had opened a little bit further by this time...but before I could go further, he excused himself and said thanks for coming over.

This was around 1985.  The guy was probably 45. Before I left, I asked him when all 'this' was supposed to happen, he said, ""within his lifetime, 20 to 30 years maybe""

I have to be honest and say, that of all the people I met in Wellington and all the deals I did, it would be this guy, who stands out as someone who made a lifelong impact on me in less than 5 minutes. If that was his aim, he certainly succeeded. I think of him sometimes and wonder if he's still their waiting.

My story is of the last scenario

Over time I had found my gfriends behaviour increasingly strange , her nightshifts , her cleaning habits , her odd friends she kept.

I wanted to ignore it but then I decided to investigate.

And my investigation led me to find out she was infact a full Reptilian. You can imagine my dissapointment - this was my fiance. 

I still live with her now and she does not know that I have discovered that she is a Reptilian.

Do I still love her ? Well yes I do. But I cant but worry that this will come between us.

aliens,"I do not know a single soul that denies interest in the question, are we alone? No matter your background, ethnicity, political leaning, career path or diet fad, the question of extra-terrestrial life is something that sparks excitement and curiosity in each of us.
I myself have been fascinated with this topic for some 20 years, since I was just a little boy. I have studied, watched, read and listened to countless articles, stories, documentaries and books. I have even had what I believe to be an encounter myself, when I was 26 years of age, photographing the stars at night in the middle of the Canadian wilderness. I even have an image of the thing I saw, however blurry and strange it appears. I will go further into this topic later on in this article but for now, I want to touch base on some of the most important factors of our most interesting question.
To begin, the idea of aliens and UFO's brings to forth questions that undermine our very understanding of reality. Not just because we are yet to understand whether planet Earth is one of a kind and if we are some unique species that has reached a level of intelligence unknown by a being within the universe. But because the how, what, why and who are almost unanswerable.
We can never know that which we do not yet know. This whole question is a myriad of complications. I am trying to piece together many facets of it, from reality to infinity to multi-dimensional. There are many reasons a secret as big as this might be kept from public eye, however, there is only so long that secrets can be just that, especially on a scale as grand as this one.
Below you will read a very mixed bag of ideas, and, although I may not have the answers you seek, I might have something here that is of interest to you.



Technology and Unstoppable Progression

Over the past 70 years Humans have made unsurmountable progress in technological advancements. Exponential growth, year after year, helps us define and improve upon previous generations of thinkers to enable a more technologically adapt world. Go back in time 100 year and give someone an iPhone and they would think you came straight out of a science fiction book. However, technology alone is not enough to produce the world we live in. This world needs human ambition above all else to excel into the next stages of apparent evolution. We cannot stop making stuff. We cannot turn back now. The factories are not going to close. The technology we have is not going to end its advancements here in 2020, no matter how good we have it.
Humans have as tendency to continually reach for more. We don’t just want the apple from the tree, we want to own and splice the seeds that made the tree in the first place so we can just produce the apples without the tree. We want shortcuts.
Im not bashing technology here, it has improved our lives in ways unimaginable 1000 years ago. We truly have improved the global populations lives by the use of tech. The problem is, will we know when to stop. This leads into further questions, further investigations into the reasons we do this, and just like the question we seek to answer above, we end up bending reality in search for answers.
Let us continue down this long and winding path and let me thank you for coming along.



Alien Technology

What if our rapid advancements in technology were not from our own ideas and production but of that of another species, one that has reached a level of technological superiority that we are not yet aware of. Think about this for a moment;
The Big Bang (which was most likely not the beginning of the universe but a natural cycle on a scale of time we cannot understand) happened 13.77 billion years ago.
The first stars formed within around 400 million years.
Earth came around some 8 billion years after that.
Homo Sapiens have been here for some 300,000 years.
Neanderthals lived around 1,000,000 years before supposed extinction.
We thought the earth was flat until 3rd century BC.
We figured out the earth rotates around the sun in 1543.
We figured out electricity around 300 years ago.
Humans split the atom in 1938.
The internet began in 1983.
Nowadays a car can drive itself. We have holographic imaging. Quantum Computing has completed calculations that the best supercomputer would take 2 billion years to calculate.
We can safely complete heart surgery today even though we only discovered germs in 1890 and 100 years ago we were sticking ice picks into the skulls of “unwell” patients to fix brain issues. We are splicing genomes and creating genetically altered babies. I am only including a tiny fraction of the capabilities of our technology at this current time in 2020.
And yes, of course I can also see the probable line of human ingenuity and factors that create a very plausible scenario that all of this technology was created by the hands of humans.
However, not only is it much more fun to imagine alternative scenarios, it is also an option that cannot be ruled out when all the evidence has been laid out in front.



I nfinity

Whether you believe in the infinite universe theory or the big bang theory, both explanations are outstanding. I want to take a moment to discuss infinity and time. Please note, I am not a scientist, I am not the person you should be coming to for scientifically resolute information. However, what I do want is to speculate possibilities.
Mathematical infinity exists. And on the mathematical scale you can have a variety of infinities. There is no natural process that is known to us that holds a beginning and an end. Everything is continuous. Yes you could speculate that an action has a beginning, for example, when you pick up a fork to eat a piece of food, the beginning of the action is when your muscle fibers twitch and your body begins to move. However, this takes only an action/reaction understanding and does not represent the possibility of what I consider continuity.
The better we get at measuring, the closer we get to the apparent beginning or end. This will go on forever. The further into the universe we peer, the more we see. The scales in which we perceive the world change vastly every time we improve the tool we use to measure it. The better the microscope, the smaller the molecule and so on.
Maybe beginnings and ends are only possible in a dimension in which time is linear.
Maybe that is our dimension, maybe it is not. However, one thing I have thought about is that if space and time are able to be bent, if the fabric of reality is warped, what would we say about this dimension we exist inside. Again, what we don’t know we don’t know appears to be of high importance to us.



Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics will screw with your head. I am a moron so please bear with me but what I want to do describe a couple interesting facets of quantum mechanics, not because stand alone they give us an explanation into alien phenomena but because a better perspective on our understanding of reality can aid in the bigger picture.
This science deals with the behavior of matter and light on an atomic and subatomic scale attempting to describe and account for the properties of molecules and their constituents.
So let’s start with Quantum Superposition. In Quantum Mechanics, measurement equates reality. Only when molecules have been measured are they determined. This basically means that before measurement the molecules exists in two places at once. They are both a wave and a particle. Only when we look at the molecule do we see it exist in one place alone. Check out Schrodinger’s Cat Paradox for more on this.
Quantum Entanglement. This phenomenon occurs when a pair of molecules or group remain connected so that actions performed on one affect the other, even when separated by great distances. They do so by transmitting data to one another faster than the speed of light. Something we are yet to understand fully.



Gravity, Space &amp; Time

Lets try to understand time a little better. Einstein described time as the fourth dimension and space the three dimensional arena in which time manifests. Space shows us co-ordinates such as length, width and height. Time provides an additional 4th co-ordinate, direction.
Imagine placing a bowling ball on your bed. As the weight of the ball presses down on the surface and sinks it causes the surrounding area to bend. Now imagine a fourth-dimensional fabric called space-time that exists throughout the universe. A grand, infinite bed if you will. Each object resting on this fabric of space-time creates its own dimple in the material, this dimple is a bending of space-time around the object and is what causes the object to move on along a curved path. This is what we call gravity.
Einstein’s theory of relativity says that time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast you move in relation to something else in space. The faster you move, the slower time progresses. This is why engineers have to make micro-calculations for satellites in space. Each day the clocks on board these crafts flying at extreme speeds gain 38 microseconds.
This is called time dilation. The effect in a sense, is time travel. An astronaut returning home will be younger than an identical twin that remained on earth.
Some scientists have speculated that if you could travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum than you would be able to create a wormhole between points in space-time.
Hypothetically speaking, if we were to be able to effectively and safely travel faster than the speed of light, time would no longer exist in a linear fashion. We should be able to traverse the dimension of time at our will. Past, present, future would be accessible.
We are no where near the technological advancements necessary to produce this, but that doesn’t mean that something else has not reached this stage.
NASA are working on a wormhole machine though, just saying.



Gravity Propulsion &amp; Element 115

Also named Muscovium, this elements existence was confirmed in 2013 when Russian scientists smashed atoms together. However, this was not the first time the public had heard of this element.
Some 30 years ago a man by the name Bob Lazar came out to the public with information about element 115. Lazar worked at a secret American government facility in Nevada called S-4, and came out in 1989 to the public to disclose secrets of flying saucers and advanced alien tech. Lazar claimed that he had been hired to work on alien craft at this top secret base. Inside this base were 9 different flying saucers, of which some of them were full operational. Lazar says his work was there based in combustion and how the craft move. This is where things begin to get very interesting.
There are many facets to Lazars story that need the light of day but I want to focus solely on two things that stand out.
Firstly, Lazar tells us that these spacecraft move using a gravity propulsion system. To put that in perspective, everything we have now moves is based on some form of ejection. Throw stuff out the back and the vehicle moves forward. This is the only propulsion system we know and it is based on how we understand reality and the mechanics of physics.
The gravity propulsion system that Lazar speaks about is something we could have never imagined. First off, we don’t even fully understand gravity today. The idea that we could use it to our advantage, manipulate it and govern it is something out of sci-fi books. The implications of managing gravity this way would change our very understanding of reality. Human nature would be unequivocally different.



The machine on board the craft creates a gravitational forcefield around the UFO and allows it to bend the fabric of space-time to move. Imagine that same scene from earlier with the bowling ball on the bed. Now, place your fist in from of the bowling ball a few inches and press down, this weight will move the ball towards you. This is technically, and very simply, how the craft manages to move. Distorting the space in front of the craft to allow the craft to fall forward.
The way the craft can do this is by using what Bob Lazar calls an Antimatter Reactor and element 115. This Reactor is another thing from sci-fi movies and something we are far from being able to produce today. So far only a tiny amount of antimatter has ever been made. However, element 115’s existence was confirmed in 2013 and renamed Muscovium, so far it has been found to have no use due to its short life span. Many theorize that this is not the same material that Bob Lazar spoke of working with at S-4.
Obviously these implications are massive and the idea takes some getting used to. However, one thing I do want to note is, planets are so far away from each other that we can’t possibly begin to imagine travelling the vast differences with the technology we currently have.
Even with the fastest engines we can make and the most streamlined spacecraft and the best scientists working on planetary slingshots etc. it would still take at least 6,300 years. It just doesn’t make any sense to me that we are going to navigate the vastness of the universe in the same manner in which we navigate the space around earth.



A Brief History
It is not as if this is a new idea is it. For as long as we have spread messages and told our stories, we have shared ideas and sighting of ‘Sky People’ and craft coming down from the heavens. Cave art and ancient paintings from many millennia ago, show a story that is as consistent as the sightings and experiences shared by people today. Religious paintings and artifacts tell much of the same.
A French cave painting from 13,000 B.C. shows a saucer with what looks like beams of light emitting from the bottom.


An Italian Cave Painting from 10,000 B.C. seems to depict two space suit wearing beings.


And it doesn’t stop there. All the way through the Sumerians, the Mayans, the Aztecs. Accounts from the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks. Recordings made by people all over the world from the moment they were able to paint upon walls.

UFO’s

A fascinating article from the New York Times in December of 2017 brought light to a secret Pentagon program in which billions was being allocated in the investigation of UFO’s named AATIP. In April of 2020 the Pentagon released three Navy videos to the public and confirmed the existence of UFO’s, or as they are calling, unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP’s.
The first time in history we have a public announcement and declaration that there is something unknown to us out there. This does not immediately mean aliens of course, it could be a secret wing of an even more secret government or private corporation with an advanced technology that the public, and maybe even most major countries, world leaders and heads of state are unaware of.
The video footage that was released is outstanding in and of itself. However, what backs up the footage (especially in todays age when deepfake and photoshop talent is almost imperceptible from reality) are the testimonies from the pilots and co-pilots, along with the other witnesses such as engineers, radar specialists etc.. On top of this data, you will also find that these cases are not isolated. They are not rare. It is not the first time this has been seen by American pilots.
It turns out it is not the first time it has been seen by pilots from all over the world, since the time we begun taking flight. People way smarter than me have put in way more time and work getting the details and the stories and data from some of the most reputable and respected names in government, armed forces, space exploration and science.
What they find are stories that are of a consistent nature and footage that seems to show saucers and crafts of varying styles visiting earth. There do appear to be similarities in UFO sightings though and it is important to note these characteristics as it may lead us towards a clearer picture.


Anti-Gravity propulsion
The craft appear to be able to move in any angle, without needing to turn the craft. No wings or rotors can be seen on the craft and they are usually always saucer shaped, tic-tac shaped or spherical.
Sudden, instantaneous acceleration
These craft have been observed moving in ways and at speeds that would crush a human pilot based on the amount of g-force created. These UFO have been identified by the navy and pilots as moving more than 30 times the speed of sound. One such incident occurred of the coast on San Diego. The U.S.S Nimitz aircraft carrier was able to track the object for just a short period of time witnessing it travel an outstanding 3,600 miles an hour. The fastest jet on Earth can get to about 1/3rd of that speed.
Zero signature/sonic boom
Using our understanding of physics, when something travels faster than the speed of sound a sonic boom should follow. This is not seen to happen with any of the UFO sightings. What is more is very rarely do witnesses see any signature whatsoever from the craft. No engine fume, no smoke. There is some heat given off by the craft and that can be detected on radar but tracking systems do not seem to work on these saucers very well in the first place. Occasionally a witness on the ground seeing a low flying UFO will record some form of a signature, maybe a glow emitting from the craft. Witnesses of this nature go further to say that when the craft lifts up in to the air further, the signature disappears.
Splitting the atom and nuclear bombs
There appear to be more cases recorded than ever before from the moment we split the atom and used it to create devastating destruction across the globe. The idea is that this feat of technological brilliance and the unbelievable chaos that ensued from it may have notified our space neighbors of our existence. I do not partake in this idea too much, however, If I was to go down the rabbit hole I would say this about it.
Close encounters of the 3rd kind appear to carry with them a message. Many witnesses that have come in to contact with these beings say that through the use of telepathy the being sends a very distinct and clear message. This message appears to be “Do not screw up earth, it is fragile, there are not many earths like this one and it needs to be looked after and cared for”. It is an interesting message that could be many things; some form of global consciousness, an idea that is sparked through an enlightening moment, an epiphany of sorts. However, it could also be something much more, I will get in to the specifics of this message later in the article.
For now it is worthwhile to note that Nuclear Missile silos across the globe from Russia to America have witnessed a one by one disabling of their missiles with the arrival of a strange UFO caught on radar. Fighter jet pilots that have attempted to shoot down UFO’s have stated that there weaponry was unusable. Armed services on the ground such as police that have witnessed a close encounter with the 3rd kind have stated that guns would not work, they even go as far to say they were unable to lift the gun from their holster, as if the being was stopping them.
Maybe, when civilization reaches a certain level of intelligence and technological advancement we stop being a bunch of violent apes. There are many maybes though, I’ll let you make your own decision.



A note on Monoliths and Ancient Civilizations

Some anomalies appear throughout history that provide us with a different picture of the past. As we progress with technology like carbon dating and Lidar scanning we uncover data points that provide us with a different picture of history. We seem to have accepted the fact that we regularly come across stone structures of unknown origin that very obviously appear to have been made by the hands of a race with advanced construction technology.
The Pyramid of Giza is the most obvious example but this alone is too much of an enigma it seems to warp our understanding and put us in a place of obscure acceptance. The great Sphinx has previously been thought to exist some 4000 years ago, however, new data is showing that this information could be very wrong.
The Sphinx could be as old as 12,000 years based on water erosion marks along the side of the enclosure that do not allow the current prediction methods to be applied. The now famous Gobeklitepe monolith sight in Turkey dates back some 12,000 years and appear to be one of the oldest agricultural sights or temples we have ever found.
Easter island is another example, along with Stonehenge and many more. It is worth noting how much of our past still remains unknown to us.
It is very possible that due to asteroid impact or another grand catastrophe we have lost large swaths of data about what came before us. There are chances that there have been civilizations as intelligent if not more than we are today. Just because we don’t find iPhones in the ground when we dig doesn’t mean our ancestors were stupid.


Abductions, inseminations &amp; encounters with the 3rd kind

Countless abductions have been reported over the past 70 years, starting with the infamous Betty and Barney Hill case in 1961. Usually there are similarities in these stories and those consistencies are as follows. Small child like beings, metallic room with smooth almost seamless panels. Big eyes, big head, sometimes lacking in a mouth.
Witnesses of beings state a strange abnormality in time. Some note it apparently feeling like it stopped. Others note that it feels as though they were there for mere minutes, it often turns out that hours have actually passed.
This strange dilation in time is something that interests me and seems to be consistent with the idea that if these beings are using gravity to bend spacetime then there may be a chance that they are travelling in the 4th dimension to do so and when they distort the gravitational field in order to move the craft, they also distort time. In my eyes this is what would allow them to travel the vast distances of space easier.
The sightings confirmed from witnesses the world over are always of a similar vein too. It is worth noting that there may be psychological factors involved in what we see and why we see it in the manner we do. Lets chat what these things look like.
Greys are the archetypal alien. They are reported to have small child like bodies, thin and frail, with large heads with big eyes. Often no mouth or nose is seen and usually an absence of genitals. They do not talk but appear to send telepathic messages.
Venusians are another visitor purported to be seen. They are said to look like human angels. The incarnation of perfection.
There is a possibility that we are seeing concepts that are mind makes into shapes resembling faces and bodies. It could be that the real “alien” is so impossible for us to imagine because it moves through different dimensions that we actually just create these physical properties and associate it to them.
Humans are prone to picking out faces in things, we do it in toast and soup and the stars. We notice patterns quickly and effectively. Maybe we are using patters to allow us to understand the phenomenon in front of us. That is not to say that what is happening is not really happening, but that it may be so foreign to us that we fabricate a reality we can barely understand to fit the experience into.


In the Deep

If I were an alien race with interest here on Earth, or, if I was a previous intelligent civilization on Earth, eventually I would realize that to live under the oceans would be the best way to maintain safety. Safety from other races, from asteroids and meteors, from earthquakes and tsunamis.
Maybe there was an advanced civilization before us, maybe there have been more than one. They may have been wiped out by any number of reasons and we could easily have went this far without finding enough evidence to prove it.
If life came from the oceans in the first place and they have remained largely unaffected by the extreme conditions found on the earths surface then why could a race of super intelligent beings not develop there.
Crafts are continuously mentioned to be seen entering our oceans and disappearing. Radar specialists have said that they watch these things zip in and out of air space and in and out of the water. The famous Tic-Tac incident came with it a sighting of a much larger craft just beneath the water. It would appear that whatever is visiting us or was here before us is using the cover of the oceans to establish operations.


My Encounter

The early hours of 1:30am in the Canadian wild. I’m at a lake edge, mountains on the horizon line, stars bright above me. I am busy taking photographs of the stars when I notice one of the stars grow bigger and brighter. It grows so big and bright that it must be as big as the moon in the sky. It glows blue around its edges ever so quickly, about 3/4s of a circle sits around it, dark black in the center with a break of darkness cutting through the circles edge. This all happens in 3 or 4 seconds.
Then the light shrinks again back into a star and moves quickly across the canvas of stars above me. It moves strangely, erratically up and down and to the left. And vanishes out of sight. Then I hear a loud splash in the lake in front of me, I turn and run so fast to my car and drive away in absolute terror.
My camera was taking snaps the whole time. The photo that captured the event turned out blurry, even though both images on either side of it were crisp and focused and the focus ring was never touched during the night. In the image you can see a white bright light 10 times that of a star in size, streaking to the left of the image.
To be honest, it looks more like a meteor than anything else. And maybe it was, it all happened so fast.


Why Aliens are US from the Future with a Message

At a school in Zimbabwe in 1994, 64 children reported meeting aliens from a UFO encounter. The story is interesting and worth looking into on your own accord but what I want to bring up is the apparent message from these visitors.
Do not destroy planet Earth. Be careful of technology. Take care of the environment.
An interesting set of messages for a possible dimension/time travelling super race. Why would they care about earth when they can traverse the dimension of spacetime so freely and have access to an almost infinite number of exoplanets, some maybe more hospitable than Earth.
I don’t know why the visitors would spread this message if they were not intrinsically involved in the health of the planet. Surely if you are living in the oceans of Earth you would care about this race of idiotic apes blowing the place up, maybe then you would be forced to make contact to try to infect the mind of these apes with a change in consciousness.
However, if aliens are the Gods that I believe them to more resemble, then I do not see why they would bother spreading this message. Maybe as a test, maybe as a factor in our evolutionary growth.
However, there are so many possibilities to consider. It could just be that this race of beings is us from the future, trying to reach out to our civilization before we go too far down the path of technology. Before we give in to our desires and remove ourselves from the sphere of animal existence.
What if we crack the wormhole in the near future, what if we make AI and quantum computers and test tube babies and we become the aliens. What if we use the wormhole of the future to peer back in time to the present and we choose a time when we were on the cusp of innovation and we try to send ourselves a message. That sounds pretty human of us.


Psychedelics
A short note on something of interest. Psychedelic experiences are somewhat of an alien experience. The realness of an otherworldly hallucinatory experience is so profound that it makes me think our ideas and concepts of aliens are very human. We give them bodies and faces and want them to have fingers and craft to move in and language to communicate with. It may be that aliens are of a different kind altogether, only accessible in a form of consciousness that is not confined by human tendencies.


Conclusion
With each year that passes, more information is released that aids us in the most interesting exploration of our most fascinating question. Are we alone? I absolutely do not think we are alone, I think the universe is probably filled with life, but I also think there is an aspect of this equation that we do not understand yet because of the confines of our own reality.
Can you even begin to imagine all that would change if we had the confirmation of an intelligent species other than ourselves? And not just another intelligent animal species, but another species that followed a similar vein to us, a technologically advanced civilization. It would change our understanding. It would give us faith that we are on the right path. Or it would create a mass panic and spark the apocalypse. Come on, show yourself!

aliens,"I’m a skeptical person by nature, and I tend to dismiss things like UFO sightings and abduction stories as bullshit. Not because I don’t believe in aliens, but because those stories don’t seem plausible, and there are other, more logical explanations as to what could’ve happened or what people could’ve seen. My beliefs will always lie in science and proven fact, and if science proves the existence of something I previously believed to be fake, I will change my mind.

But the thing is- I absolutely believe in aliens. It’s completely illogical to think earth is the only planet with life in the entire universe. Space is infinite- that means infinite galaxies, infinite solar systems, infinite planets. And if you think about the concept of infinity, there’s no way that with there being unlimited planets in the universe, there isn’t some form of life on at least one of them. Maybe it’s single-cell bacteria or plant life, but again if you think about infinity, it’s highly plausible for there to be intelligent life out there somewhere. And I desperately want for scientists to find it. I just don’t think they’ve visited earth(I can’t really blame them because who would). And I hope that we develop the technology to explore further into space so we can find alien life ourselves.",I’m going to share my beliefs on aliens even though absolutely no one asked
aliens,"Hi all,

I now have acsess to Amazon Prime, and was pleasantly suprised to see the number of UFO/ET documentaries on there, but which ones would you say are a must watch or would highly recommend? 

Thanks!",Best documentaries to watch on Amazon?
aliens,,Best piece so far
aliens,,"Video from Hawaii. I have no more details on it. Does anyone think it's legitimate, or otherwise?"
aliens,,"Video from Chile posted online 6 days ago, what's the opinion of you guys on this?"
aliens,"I’ve always liked the idea of ET beings existing/and/or having paid visits to earth, and part of me always believed that could be true. That being said, I never ended up doing any extensive research on the topic and I ending up forgetting about it for the most part.

That is until I watched The Phenomenon. This isn’t an endorsement of the documentary, nor am I saying you (skeptics) should watch it. All I’m saying is that for me, personally, it reinvigorated that interest in me.

My point, however, is to say that I’m not 100% certain that it has convinced me either. My inner skeptic continues to toss and turn and that’s mainly why I’m writing this post - most importantly, it seems as though there are only two outcomes. 

I’ve seen the documentary 3 times so far, and of course, the first watch absolutely blew my mind. My inner child watched it that time and was just blown away at the form of the documentary and the way it moved - the gravity it seems to carry. Now, of course you could point out that because I was previously interested in the topic, I have a strong bias in wanting to believe the “validity” of the documentary. This was true for the first watch.

The second time I was much more focused on the form/editing. I am an editor, so the way this documentary flowed interested me in comparison to all of those cheesy History Channel UFO docs. The editing is almost flawless. It does a tremendous job of building on the US’s timeline with these phenomenons and takes the viewer with them as though they are experiencing the Phenomenon for the first time.

The third time I saw this doc was when my inner skeptic really came out, and so far it’s been difficult to shake, which only forces me to look at it harder.

Here’s one hypothesis you could derive from the film: 
Aliens are real and they are here with us now, guiding us to our next step (probably tech related).

This is more or less what the documentary proposes in so many words - or at least that officials know much more about this stuff than we think we know. Assuming for a moment this is true, the implications are massive and possibly dangerous. This would mean that the United States had found out the purpose of these UFO visits much earlier than anyone would have thought. 

This would also explain the recent outbursts of various officials all over the world - most recently the Israeli Defense Sec who explained that we’ve been in contact, but that that we, as a human race, are not ready.

The implication is obvious. We’re not ready, but it is inevitable as declassified documents continue to peak the public interest. Not to mention the US Congress has voted to release all information pertaining to UFO sightings in due time.

But why?

This is where things get tricky. First, let’s just quickly mention some implications which will lead to my next point. We’re not ready. Why? Because each country/culture/society has developed differently. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but there would be elements, including organized religion, that would have to undergo drastic reformation in order to move humanity to being more accepting of this phenomenon.

That being said, alternatively, we live in one of the most accepting times in relation to this topic, thus time is of the essence. Of course, there is a decent chance of rejection from millions of people - even specific organizations that might acknowledge the reality of the phenomenon, but find it to be hostile to their way of life, further dividing people into their tribal groups. However, this would be why time is of the essence to show the world that this is not a bad thing - in fact in might be what we’ve been working towards for a few decades.

Again, under the hypothesis above, we would have to accept the notion that going public with something like this and having other countries speak out as well might be in some ways a Utilitarian good. In other words, all nations would have to publicly acknowledge this phenomenon, and most likely work together/learn how to work together to globalize faster. If so, technological advancements may be made for space exploration and we will no longer need to separate our borders.

Of course, this is the goal, and of course, there would be dissent. That is why it may be too soon to reveal this kind of information - because if we are too afraid or ignore it, we may end up doing the same thing we’re doing with climate change right now. And there’s no coincidence that the documentary points out that Nuclear bombs have been of special interest to UFOs which may imply that they don’t want us to use them, or (more nihilistically) that they may be using us to gain intelligence on the best way to take out our planet in the event of intergalactic warfare. I don’t really believe the ladder, but it’s a possibility. And it’s these possibilities that dissent will amplify loudly in order to combat change.

According to the doc, if these ETs are out there, they seem to want to help us and they seem to want to fix the same things that we want to fix. 

If these things don’t exist, then the US government has created one of the most advanced conspiracies, spanning decades, that want to manipulate you into wanting nuclear disarmament, a healthy climate and world peace. None of which are bad, but in this case, this elaborate conspiracy is the last ditch effort in getting humanity to work together. This same notion could be true even if there were sightings, because that would give it more credibility. In other words, the might exist, but we’re using the knowledge we have to mislead the public in order to further our personal needs.

I want to finish by saying I don’t think it is necessary a global conspiracy, but the inner skeptic in me can only find that notion of conspiracy as the only alternative answer to “Aliens are here, and this is real.” What interests me more than anything is that the documentary makes it sound like the phenomenon is apolitical, yet somehow aligns very closely with certain aspects of the liberal agenda: nuclear disarmament, technology is dangerous, climate change is bad.

If aliens are real and this is what they are communicating to us, it makes sense why. It’s only logical, especially if they get something in return for helping us. But if they’re not real and this is an elaborate way to make progress, it also makes sense why: we need a kick in the ass if we’re going to survive as a species.

TL;DR
The implications of aliens being real is immense, but it also correlates extremely close to the political issues we’ve dealt with for decades: nuclear disarmament, climate change, globalization etc. so even if it’s not real, the conspiracy should perpetuate solving these political issues as well. It’s really a win/win.

I was leaning on the wall and looked up for a split second. As soon as I looked up, directly in front of my eye sight, a very small ship appeared. It couldn't have been more than 6-8 feet long. It was probably about 400-500 yards in the sky. From my perception, I was looking at it from directly underneath. 

It looked like a helicopter with no propeller or side wings. All of the sudden, a spot light appears from the bottom. It looked like one of those lights they put out for movie premiers and shine into the sky. Anyway, the light appears from the bottom of the craft and then rotates to the front of the craft.

aliens,"Now before I get into this, I know I will most likely have some negative feedback. That is fine, all I ask is for you to think critically and consider it.

I personally have witnessed a couple UFOs. Even seen the monster triangle one. This naturally peaked my curiosity and did research.

At first, I believed they were extraterrestrial. After a couple years of research, I am now skeptical.

For one, why the secrecy? Surely an advanced race would have globally dominated us wayyyy before we've got the power to ""defend"" ourselves? If they are cross-breeding us, why has their identities changed?

If you study first hand witnesses accounts by the decade, you would know that these beings conform to whats acceptable in society. Did you the typical gray counts for majority of the sightings in the US, but in the EU, they appear as Nordics?

Isn't it suspicious that there was an explosion of alien culture starting in the 50's. In the 50s they were ""little green men"", 60s/70s astronaut/diving type and then grays. I believe science fiction/propaganda has heavily influenced our perceptions.

Why despite the advancement in cameras is there not clear,definitive proof? There is a sub-culture growing based on religion. Look at greer, he now claims you can ""meditate"" and summon UFOs...

I recommend looking into Jacques Vallees work. He attempts to use Scientific Theory and applies it into the UFO phenomenon. 

The identity of these things display characteristics of interdimensional rather than the latter. They're behaviors are very similar to mythical folklore of the past. 

I dont know exactly what it is, but I feel this is being used as a control tactic.",Suspicions of extraterrestrial claim..

At first they were willing to fully disclose the reality of alien visitors but they changed their minds because of the watergate incident. Only eight seconds of the original footage was shared, it contains a ufo in the process of landing, as for the rest they got an artist to re-create the video. 

It would've caused serious alarm otherwise, however, as a consequence of watering it down too much few took it seriously. 

Nowadays I feel that this has a fair chance at getting leaked since the political atmosphere is more welcoming plus they *already* admit to the [artistic rendering ](https://youtu.be/BT3NoIqobxQ) of the incident to be real.

You can file an FOIA request for it since they already admit to it's existence, which makes it impossible for them to turn around and deny it.

aliens,"Let's consider, for the sake of the argument, that the multiverse is a proven fact -- well, anyway, that's what most evidence today point to. If you'd like to watch an excellent ""multiverse vs universe"" debate, I suggest [this 1h20mn theoretical discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUW7patpm9s) from the 2013 World Science Festival, with scientists Andreas Albrecht, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde and Neil Turok.

Now, back to the point of this post. I guess one of the questions we'll never know the answer to is ""who or what created everything?"" -- this question may go on forever unsanwered due to infinite regress. 

Maybe some of the most developed alien species (supposing there is a vast variety of alien races) know that this universe we live in originated from another universe (or a computer simulation, or else), which itself originated from a third universe and so on. Maybe they have understood that they can't know more than that, and are -- to a certain extent -- as limited as we are in this subject's knowledge. Maybe they know a lot more than us about the quantum world, dark matter, black holes, wormholes and etc., but just can't answer these big questions.

Maybe what aliens figured out though, is that they can avoid death -- which they fear, just like we do -- forever by jumping from universe to universe before their heat death. Maybe they even know how to create a new universe. And maybe they stopped caring about who/what created everything, and just keep doing their thing to live forever.

The only way out of this ""lifestyle"" that I can think of is life after death, in the sense that they have the knowledge that after we die we become some new being that can, somehow, exist forever -- without caring about the heat death of the universe.

aliens,"I thought this through over and over again, and the truth is that there is no real chance all those military reports, pilot eye witnesses and radar data are all illusions and fruit a shared machine-human schizophrenia. There is absolutely no way by now. Fravor and Dietrich were both overly specific in their reports, its simply just not really possible that its an optical effect. I've read into actually proven optical illusions pilots and astronauts have experienced, and absolutely none of them reached such a deep amount of detail and richness.   
By now there are only two real options:   
\*There is something extraordinary going on (be it other lifeforms, fantasy-like human technology, something supernatural happening)  
\*They are blatantly lying to everyone (the US govt, the pilots, everyone would have to be involved in such case)  


No matter how much people find alternative explanations for the small videos themselves, in the end its just not possible that everything is a simultaneous mix of optical illusion and equipment malfunction, its literally more probable that those are hyper-advanced leprechauns flying those crafts.

aliens,"This was one of many I encounter with the unknown and I am wondering if others know what I am talking about or seen something similar. 

I called this inter-dimensional demon/Alien.

Not sure where to start but I'll give it a try. It was 2004 around 8pm, the middle of fall. I was in my 12th floor apartment with my cousin the same age of 17 years old. We were chilling watching TV and talking religious stuff. Heavens and Adam and Eve topics. 

""I remember talking about the exact pin-point of the location of heaven if that was a thing and the direction of hell if there was going to be one. Stuff like."" 

The lights was on. The TV was on. The room was pretty bright. I had a sofa against the wall facing the TV. To my right I had the entrance door 🚪 and on top of the entrance is the entrance light. And the light was on. Basically the apartment section where we were sitting was all on.

While we were talking, instantly I had the feeling to look to my right towards the entrances door 🚪 and what I saw and what my cousin saw was unreal. 

It was a black out invisible tall shadow. About 7 feet tall. The thing was big and skinny. No eyes, mouth, or any features. It was black like space. 

The presence of the being was there for a good 1 min. I couldn't look away. And no one was talking. My cousin saw the same exact thing. 

After the 1 min. The being disappeared. And nothing like that ever happen beside the usual triangle shape UFOs years later and stuff I saw.

But this inter dimensional being was one of its kind. I did alot of research afterwards and notice, people had shadow people, slender man type encounters? 

But this thing was different, it was coldless. No evil or love. But the sheer presence of it was fear for me thou. The thing didn't move. Its didn't make no sound and didn't give any movement. It stood there. Or hover there. 

After the encounter I ask my cousin 1 thousand times. Till this day I ask him again if he saw it. And he describe  the same exact story. 

He called it a demon and it was the sign of ""end of times."" 

I dismiss it of course. It's 2021 now and nothing happen. Because of these recent UFO stories I wanted to share this experience.

After reading up on CE5 the other week I gave it a shot, albeit with less than 20 minutes of meditation/relaxation. The first couple of night the same thing happened: I was invited to a mansion high up in the mountains, like the European alps or something, and the stone stairs leading up to the gate were rolled out to the sides, like two carpets inviting me inside. Once there it was like a fancy museum, and in the middle of the medium sized room/yard was a museum display blasting me with images. They were so intense and fast paced I couldn’t even begin to comprehend them, and I’ve already forgot what they were. That was night 1. Night 2 the same thing happened, but I asked for an image of a big parchment on which we could communicate by writing words. It worked, I asked some simple yes/no questions but after a while I felt a frustration for this way to be unnecessarily slow. So we went back to the images but that was too fast.

In the grass there was a huge brown circle shape with four lines meeting in the middle, but there were some spaces of grass between all the intersection.

That was it. Just posting here to revisit if there will indeed be a massive landing in some mountain region in Canada on July 18th or whatever. Anyone recognize any of this?",My little attempt at CE5

1948

On March 25th, 1948, an Unidentified Flying Object reportedly crash landed in Aztec, New Mexico. Following the crash, military personnel swiftly arrived in scene to pick up debris and transport the downed craft.

Similar to Roswell, reports came out of alien occupants having been inside of the UFO. In this case, 16 different bodies were reported in a published book by author Frank Scully, “Behind The Flying Saucers”.

Just as with Roswell, aliens were a cover story for the real story: the military was testing highly advanced, anti-gravitational technology with dummy occupants. In fact, this crash came roughly a year after Roswell in New Mexico too. Why are these crashes happening at Roswell? It is because that is where military testing is being conducted.

In the 1970s, in the hype of the re-emerged alien interest in the public with Roswell, this story was resurfaced and many claimed it to have been an incident of extraterrestrial origin. In 2013, the FBI revealed that they had never investigated the incident for extraterrestrials, leading some to believe that it’s all a cover-up. The truth is, this was all a cover-up for secret anti-gravitational technology being tested by the military in New Mexico.

What was odd about this helicopter is that is was all black and flying really low and seemed to slow down a bit when going over my house. It flew over twice yesterday, once during the day and once at night. 

Now it could very well be me just being paranoid but I had just replied to another person's post with my theory of extra-terrestrials manufacturing enough craft to cover the skies of the planet and therefore there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that they exist.

aliens,,"Experts Weigh In on Pentagon UFO Report - The vast majority of examined incidents were not caused by U.S. advanced technology programs, the forthcoming report concludes. So what’s going on?"
aliens,"Okay, so for context, this occurred in 2009. I was 17 years old, a senior in high school in a small rural south Texas town. I was on the school bus with about a dozen other students, we were returning home from an academic competition a few hours away on a Saturday. So this wasn’t a bus full of kids playing pranks or anyone on drugs or anything of the sort, it was the top 5% of my class and the accompanying chaperone teachers, including the valedictorians and salutatorians for both the senior and junior classes. We all saw the same things and had nothing to gain by lying. This was also before smartphones were a common thing, so other than my cheap .2 megapixel flip phone and my friend’s iPhone 3g, we did not have the best options for taking photos or videos of this. 

The sun was already setting, it was getting dark quickly. I was talking to my friend and his girlfriend who were sitting in the seat across from mine, and behind them through the window was a large empty field, I think it was used to grow cotton. I was the first one to notice a large object floating in the middle of the field. I point it out to my friends. We spent a good few minutes trying to determine what it was. The light was dimming from the sunset, but we could see a large black triangle floating about 300 yards away, about 100 feet off the ground. It had four lights, one on each corner and one in the middle. We all stared at it wondering what it was. It silently hovered over the field, but was getting closer to us. About 3 minutes in, the bus had to turn, so now the object was behind the bus. Most of the students and a teacher ran to the back to continue viewing it. The object was now floating closer to the bus, imagine a kite tied to the bumper. The object was no more than 100 feet above the ground, and now about 100 feet behind the bus. The object was about the same length as the school bus, maybe a little bigger. We could all clearly see the black triangle silently chasing the bus. Then, after maybe a minute of it trailing us, POOF, it vanished. It wasn’t instantaneous, it was like someone pulled the cloak of invisibility from Harry Potter over it, going from one end to the other. Or like The Predator when he cloaks, except there was no visible outline or light shimmer. It was gone, vanished. M We all screamed because we didn’t know wtf was going on. Here you have a group of the top students in the entire high school and the teachers that sponsored them, frightened and flabbergasted at what we just perceived. We looked around the bus, it was quickly getting dark but there was no sign of the triangle. We didn’t know if it was really gone or if it had just gone invisible. We were back at the school about 10 minutes after the triangle disappeared, it was already dark. No one could come up with an explanation. We still can’t. We still bring up this incident to this day whenever we get together. I’m trying to get some of the witness on record to get and preserve a solid account of the incident. We all became believers after that point. 

Also, not sure if it adds credence to my story, but my father was an Air Force staff Sargent for 20 years. I spent a good chunk of my childhood on military bases. I’ve seen military grade helicopters and jets up close, more closely than many other civilians. I can definitely say the object was not a helicopter or aircraft I had ever seen. My father couldn’t explain it either, unfortunately he passed last year so I can’t ask him any further questions on his time in the military. Also this was less 10 miles from the Mexican border, and while we did frequently see border helicopters in the area patrolling, this was not it chief.","My very close encounter with a UFO, with multiple witnesses"

I’m the son of a Cuban immigrant father who was a dissident of the Castro regime. My father spent time as a political prisoner for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs. I grew up in South Florida and, as a young man, I was often exposed to my father’s efforts in helping change the political situation in Cuba.

Later, I attended the University of Miami, with double majors in Microbiology and Immunology and minors in Chemistry. I also gained advanced research experience in Parasitology and certain tropical diseases such as Malaria and Trypanosomiasis.

My goal with these degrees was to enter the medical field. During my research experience I was tangentially exposed to government agencies that were interested in biological research and intelligence. It was at this point I decided to pursue a career in intelligence and realized my true passion. I also decided to enlist in the U.S. Army.

During my short tenure in the U.S. Army, I had the honor and privilege to serve in various assignments. As a Counterintelligence Special Agent, I was assigned to the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and later, throughout America’s Southwest. As a young Agent, I conducted counterespionage investigations, provided technology protection of advanced aerospace systems and platforms, supported U.S./Russia Treaties (Open Skies &amp; START-II), and conducted routine security background investigations.

Shortly thereafter, I was recruited into a Special Activities Program with the Department of the Army. This led me to new assignments throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. As an Intelligence Operations Officer, my responsibilities included oversight of sensitive source operations, counter-insurgency missions, and support to counter-narcotics.

Immediately following the aftermath of the attacks on September 11th, I spent the following years working alongside our brave men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and the Middle East.

In these environments, I worked with the full spectrum of U.S. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies, focusing our efforts along with Special Operations to identify and defeat terrorist organizations. In this environment I was able to work within a multi-national effort supporting the global war on terror.

After several assignments in the Middle East, I was assigned to Washington D.C. as the Overseas Investigations Desk Officer. There I had the responsibility of managing foreign intelligence and terrorist investigations worldwide. Over the next several years, I worked within a variety of intelligence agencies and organizations.

In 2008 I was asked to be part of the now-famous Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). 

In 2010, as a Staff member for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), I assumed the lead role for this endeavor. Our mission was to conduct scientific-based, intelligence investigations of incursions by Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) into controlled U.S. airspace.

In 2017, with a heavy heart, I resigned from my position inside the Pentagon in an effort to raise awareness of the UAP issue. The decision to resign was based on my sense of loyalty to the Secretary and my beloved Department, in order to dismantle the bureaucratic silos and stovepipes hindering the conversation about this important topic.

In 2017, I joined a private company comprised of former intelligence officers, engineers, scientists, and an entertainer to advocate UFO/UAP transparency. This effort provided us a platform to engage U.S. Congressional leadership, Executive level policy makers, and the media.

In early 2018, I began working with A&amp;E’s History Channel to help expose the truth about the phenomena on the television series UNIDENTIFIED: Inside America’s UFO Investigation. This collaboration allowed several of my colleagues and I to raise awareness of UFOs/UAPs while showcasing the investigative process and legitimizing the science behind our work. In this series, I was both a Host and Technical Producer.

In late 2020, I decided to focus on disclosure advocacy at the global level…and this is where our journey begins!

In my personal time, I enjoy spending time with my family and experiencing new cultures and the process of learning new perspectives on all aspects of society.

My passion involves anything having to do with science and trying to uncover the hidden language of the universe.
I spend much of my free time with my family and our two beloved German Shepherds, Paris and Hercules, and hiking the trails in the mountains.

I also enjoy stargazing with friends and family over a warm bonfire.

I am a staunch supporter of individual freedoms.

I’m an inventor holding multiple patents in marine transportation and I’m a classic car enthusiast.

My greatest accomplishments are my two daughters.
I’m also a champion of veteran groups and a supporter of animal rights.

My hope for the future is to engage more people and learn from each other, based on our varied backgrounds, unique experiences, and rich diversity.",The Washington Post: UFOs &amp; National Security with Luis Elizondo.

aliens,"Okay so it is currently 3:40 in SP right now, and I'm restless as every other night and I'm gazing out of my always opened window, looking for shooting stars to make a wish on. So as I'm doing that I see one, tiny blue dot moving across the clear sky and watch it a good distance whilst making my wish until it burns out.
 I go to step away from the window as it burns out when I see a closer (like just below the troposphere ) , brighter blue shooting star except it's being followed close by another identical star moving at the same steady pace, then there's another, and then another and then another!
Before long I'm convinced I'm looking at a meteor shower, but no, these are all in a close succession, one glowing light after another moving in a single file line. I don't bother to grab my android because there's no way I'm giving up a sight like this for my grainy ass camera(android) not to pick it up.
I'm not too far from the airport so I tried to rationalize that maybe these were some sort of aircraft, but there was absolutely no noise. Not to mention how close they were and they didn't have any red or green lights on either side.
These, beautiful star like things were just aiming north from where I am, and at a certain point they all faded out like the first shooting star. The center of these star like things were almost white but the hue around them were blue, it was so amazing! 
I'm excited because I always knew there was something more than us, (I'm a Christian) and I'm excited to see it first hand!

But it's 2020 and Aliens for June might be not so great?","I believe, but for certain now!!"
aliens,"I may as well share all my recent experiences, before they become drowned out with more, or something happens to me lol. Bare with me, they're out there, literally. 

So basically, I've seen UFO like fenomina where I live every so often my entire life. From a spinning disk that let of magenta light which hovered next to a telephone pole down the road when I was maybe 12, to dozens of red balls of flame like UFO's above the mountains which zipped around in unrealistic and playful ways, witnessed around the time I was in highschool. To a ""commet"" like ball of light that had fallen, flew and ""followed"" along the car I was in along an adjacent road. I had maybe been 15 when I had seen that. 

More recently I have seen a white streak like a rectangular smear on a windshield suddenly showing up in the sky like intense ""broken"" light and just as quick as it shown up, it was gone. This was 6-12 months ago.

Maybe around 2 years ago, I had see an odd foreignly and unexplainably black helicopter looking aircraft which have all silver colored filling as well as no pilot or passengers, no doors, no windows and is completely silent with a disk like ""headlight"" inside of it. Which glew an intense white blue. I'd seen it around 3 am hovering at the top of my driveway directly above the telephone lines and road at an extremely low altitude. Feet above the wires. No more than 12.

Most noteably, whenever I am outside this year and the  sky is clear and the stars are visible, if I gaze long enough, I will see dust like dots amoungst the stars that travel in random directions and are so high up, you can barely make them out with the naked eye. They go in logical directions that aren't a perfectly straight path and are in no way simply satellites. I will see them as lone sets and sometimes they'll cross semi close paths, but never at the same exact time. Some will be way closer to the earth than others, but never completely visible to make out any specifics. Rather than, ""round"". 

This is noteable, because I only began experiencing this after I had an intense few weeks of seeing a mysterious and extremely, extremely bright, magnesium-like light in the west sky. It would rise from the hill the first few times id seen it and ""flicker"" in clear skies. It would dim down then become intenseley brighter and would appear around 10pm, then disappear anytime between 12am and 2 am. 

On days of clear skies following, I'd seen it as if it were becoming closer for a few days. Then we had a bunch of cloudy days and I lost track of it. When I looked again, I showed my parents on a night of clear skies and my dad joked that it is the ""west star"", because at first, like I had, he had thought it was the north star, but no, it wasn't. We actually don't see the north star anymore. This ""west star"" has at this time been long disappeared as well. 

Well, I looked it up and this happened 1-1 1/2 months ago and it wasn't a planet. Which takes out that possibility. If I ignored the fact that it'd sometimes raise from the hill /from the west/ and then set at some point. Yeah, that /could/ have been a possibility. 

Note, this ""star"" is also EXTREMELY bright. Which is why I compare it to magnesium. It is the brightest thing I have ever seen in my life, best described as just that, a massive volume of magnesium in the sky. Also to note, it did not hurt the eyes to look at it. It was also nearly the only thing my phone camera would pick up light wise in the dark. Even in the sky. We all know how that is when trying to take pictures of the sun or moon.

I took some pictures of this star. In the pictures, you can see how bright it is for yourself. It is 100% impossible for this to be anything normal. 

I can't say nothing else strange hasn't happened since seeing this. I had a night where I heard odd cluttering and impressions made against the side of the house, where my window is, as if something was moving around on it. I'm a very brave person, probably stupidly brave, so I stuck my head out my window and though I did not see anything, I smelt this strange, ashy, sweet porky, french fry aroma that also sort of resembled the scent of mildew on a tree as well. No. This wasn't a barbecue. It was at least between 12am and 3am and I know the differnece between a great barbeque and something that doesn't belong. It smelled like 1 thing. That's hard to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it, but it did. 

I continued to hear strange sounds that night and even heard creaking footsteps in my house when everyone else was definitely asleep without a doubt, I checked. Our house doesn't creek unless we're in the middle of a wind storm. I also heard sounds as if someone was opening things in the kitchen, but not closing them. I wasn't too worried in the end (I have a lock on my door) and my theory is, if they wanted to mess with me, they would have and they would have shown themselves to me. All in all, they wouldn't be sulking around, ultimately doing nothing otherwise. Whatever it was or they are.

So, here's the weirdest of them all and even I am hesitant to share this and I'm pretty carefree. For a while after these weird events. Maybe a period of a week, seen on at least 3 different days. I would see from the corner of my eye, a black Ferrari like car, parked at the top of my driveway at the side of the dirt road. They'd be facing the mailbox so they could see the house and the Ferrari itself would be very very strange. 

I'd see it when it wasn't in my mind to even think about it and every time I would see it, I would forget about it right away. As if it never happened and it did not exist to begin with. Until I saw it again, and then again, I slowly gained and retained memories of the vehicle. Though I did ultimately forget about it again since I haven't seen it in a long while. I'm only now able to remember, thanks to a video I had seen from a post in here that reminded me that it happened.

It was-and this is where it gets weird, constructed out of pannel-like parts that made up the body of the vehicle. Between the panel were white lights that glew a soft pink and I think blue. The panels were in a topographic, grid like fashion as well. So, I could make out the general shape of the vehicle apart from the darkness. Like the helicopter, it was imposibley black. I have no words to explain, but ""nothingness"" yet ""somethingness"" and I would only see this in the daytime.

The ferrari like vehicle was a bit bulkier than a ferrari and had a wide and thick front gate. Idk what they're called. Just that the front of the vehicle was wide like an impact vehicle and looked possible armored because of it. It's hard to remember all the details and it makes my heard hurt to do so. 

Well, let's get even weirder. I would see this vehicle for a split second at first, then it'd be gone. No noise, no true presence, just like it was there then not. I saw it longer every time I had seen it and more clearly. Which is why when I first saw it, I thought my imagination was getting the better of me. The last time I had seen it, I was able to see more. There was this weird effect that happened with it that I can't explain other than, it looked like it was ""warping"" at the back end of it. Between being physically here and not. Think of any cheesy game, show, or movie where every time it shows something going so fast, you can only see half of it and it looks like some sort of unfinished oil painting. This is what it looked like. Shimering, and colorful, half there and just ""?"".

I don't even want to believe that vehicle exist. It's that crazy, even for me. Whatever it was, whatever any of this is, God yall better hope I'm just some crazy lunatic lmao 

I should note that I live semi near an airforce base a few states over. I will occasionally see jets and army helicopters flying above. Many times the helicopters can be seen in formations of up to 6 and the jets are always alone. My parents have also told me stories from before I was born, where they would see MASSIVE charcoal or grey planes which would fly above the mountain, too close to make sense. That it looked like they were crashing, but they were just flying by. 

This year, I have also noticed that for example, I will go in the woods to plant things like flowers and fruit bushes, change it up a little, search for wild fruits to move in other locations, etc, just to find myself soon accompanied by a helicopter. 

The helicopter will hover maybe 2-3 football fields high at a nearby area very close to me. Which makes no sense, because all that's out here are fields and trees and it is not an emergency vehicle. It was tan and had no lights.

The helicopter circled around the area once or twice, sticking incredibly close, yet as far away as it was. Basically, lingering for no apparent reason that I could conceive. If something was going on, our scanner would pick up and we would know about it and it wasnt a drug helicopter. I've seen those before and they stick to a general route and don't need to go low, because of how good their equipment is.

That happened when I had pulled aside and planted lilac in a general hidden area, off the trail for a while. I was out of sight and it felt almost as if they were looking for me. Which this sounds even more crazy, but the area they were in was the area I was thinking of going to plant the lilacs, but decided not, because I didn't want to take my chances with running into a bear or anything else dangerous. Which that general area is known for. I had only thought that in my mind and this was the first time anything so personal and weird had happened to me, involving a helicopter. It just seemed to be looking for /me/. It followed the paths I/was/ on at first and everything.

I don't remember what happened after, but I did end up finishing up and heading back home before getting to the apple trees. All in all, a bunch of weird as* experiences and coincidences? Either way, let's hope I'm crazy.

I don’t care what anyone says I swear it was a UFO. So it was around 10-11pm and I was walking back to my apartment coming home from a friends apartment. As I was walking I looked up to see if I could see any stars and one thing stuck out to me. A bright green light that sat stationary in the sky. I couldn’t tell how far away it was, but a couple seconds later it raced into space faster than anything I’ve ever seen before. The scariest part was that it was so visible one second and the next I watched it zoom into space in the blink of the eye. There’s no logical explanation thinkable that could debunk this as it NOT being a ufo. Of course no one believed me but it stuck with me, and I will never forget that bright green light.

aliens,"Of course they could just be saying that to get media attention. People will do anything for fame. I have seen a few pics of this meteorite online and it certainly looks interesting and unique. 2.8kg is pretty big for a meteorite remnant though granted there probably are larger meteorite fragments. Do you think it has anything to do with aliens? After that Mage UFO crash? Through my telescope I have seen 6 UFOs now including one that was a bright gold orb and had a long gold tail. Though I am thinking that was a comet, meteor, or asteroid etc. And the others are most likely satellites. One did seem to bob up and down in a wave like motion.

Your heart is physically and spiritually healed,” the being said. “It is to our benefit to keep you well.” He then told her that she must stop eating meat, that eating meat is like consuming your own flesh, that it was because of her diet that they had to heal her heart. 

“You must tell people to stop eating animals,” he said. “You must tell people that you are all interconnected. 

The power of intention is real. Thought is real. If you don’t stop putting out the greed and negativity you are putting out, you are going to kill your race.” 

Lynnette was stunned by the message, but the being was insistent. “The power of intention is real,” he repeated. “Thought is reality. You must pay attention because you are going to do what we did.” “He was concerned that we’re going to self-destruct like they did,” Lynnette says, “that we’re going to become nothing like they did. 

They chose to become higher beings, and in doing so, they bred out their emotions and lost the ability to reproduce.”

#3. Monitor Your Thoughts. 

This teaching impacted my life in a way I can’t even begin to describe. As with the other lessons, they took this one much deeper than it appears to be in the simple form it is offered. They started out by teaching me that everything that is happening in the world is a result of our thoughts. 

Every thought that every person has creates an energy stream, and it brings about the life we consider to be our reality. They were very harsh in explaining that the reason our planet is one filled with pain, trauma, war, disease, and disasters is because of one simple reason: our thoughts—our fear-based thoughts. We project these ideas out, and they are mirrored back to us in the form of seemingly physical experiences. 

Unfortunately, the validation created by having our fearful thoughts mirrored back to us in the form of life experiences also contributes to the downward spiral. We believe the world is an unsafe place and that we can be harmed, and so we project that. It becomes our reality and, therefore, reinforces the fearful thought and creates more fearful thoughts. No wonder our world is in such a state!

It all connects together. Our thoughts do affect everyone else on the planet. We have a responsibility to ourselves and to all humanity to bring about the desired change that is needed by simply changing our thoughts.",Grays on How Our Thoughts and Intentions Create Reality 👽✨

aliens,"So this was something that happened a few hours ago and I had to take some time to a figure out what exactly went on. If I need to post this somewhere else, I will. 

But onto what happened:

So yesterday, I was talking to some friends on Xbox party and drinking since it was the weekend. Around 7:45pm, I got a bit tired (which happens to me when I drink for a bit so not an issue). I told all of them I would be back and took a power nap. I would wake up around 9:00pm felling refreshed and ready to hop back on. But as I stared up at my bedroom ceiling (room was dark), I started to see these jumble of transparent words floating around with some becoming clear enough to read. It disturbed me cause it was words like, ""Run"" ""Closer"" ""Room"" ""Soon"", and a hazy outline of an alien head with detailed eyes coming closer to be as these words were getting faster. I quickly got out of bed and went to my living room (making sure to close my bedroom door) to just figure out what exactly happened. 

I can't say what the explanation could be precisely, be it just waking up, brain messing with me, or something more legitimate was about to happen/has happened. 

If anyone could help me explain this, that would be appreciated, even if it just turns out to be nothing.",Waking up seeing images/words

They reflect and move fluid across teh sky. I have never really believed in UFO's because I have never first hand witnessed any unusual sighting until tonight. at 10:34PM MST I saw an orb that radiated a slight glow. It was moving at a rate that appeared to be slower than a satellite, but not in the typical direction of any satellite orbit I have seen (this one was going northwest).  And it maneuvered as it went. I saw it and it was gone within 25 seconds, but I could tell it was different. It maneuvered  from the left to the right slightly and then back to center as it increased altitude. I could tell because the glowing orb became smaller as the elevation increased and it eventually disappeared after about 25 seconds. IFrom my view it only went ablout 3 inches from when I saw it until it disappeared. It made no noise and I could only view it through my NVG. I looked at it out of my other non-NVG eye, and could see nothing. it was only visible in the IR.  knew when I was watching that that it was special and I would probably never see anything like it again.  It was a full spherical shape that emitted a glow. It was extremely large for a star. I would say it would look the size of 10 large stars combined and then disappeared to nothing as its elevation increased.",Saw First UFO Tonight with NVG

aliens,"I know a lot of people won’t believe me because I hit my head and almost died. But I made it back. 

I am not here to tell you wild ideas about the great beyond but what I have experienced and still are today. If you believe me, awesome- if not and u think I’m full of shit, that’s also awesome!

Because I believe we all are sent here as souls to occupy new bodies in. There is life everywhere in the cosmos, a lot have come and are still coming. Especially among us, they’ve been here since before humanity and they will be here after. 

The reason why they don’t reveal themselves to us is because we are a destructive creature and we can not only destroy ourselves but earth all together.

See earth is a part of the universe. They do not want to see a bunch of apes destroy the home. Yet they probably won’t interfere with the destruction.

They just love us like how a parent still loves you even after you burn their house down. Will they be upset? Probably. But in reality “hate” is something that only exists in 12 dimensions (Multiple of 3, apparently evening is based on 3) our “souls” or “essence” is everything. 

Buddhism was the most correct on the afterlife. For when u die u could get reincarnated into another living thing anywhere in the 3rd dimension universe. That’s including all time and multiple different universes. 

The only way we can break out of this dimension is easy! First every human has to realize that money and wealth is not a real goal to strive towards. I’m not talking to the people who are broke, hungry and struggling for food. No I’m addressing millions and billionaires. Guys u want to save earth? Give everyone an equal right to succeed. Because with out the worker bees the queen won’t get any sugar. That’s how a  hive dies. I don’t want that to happen to our hive called earth.

So anyways I realized this one night laying in bed, I just asked no one in particular maybe my “Guardian Angel (ET)” to have a beautiful woman (that I follow on Instagram) to date me. Mind u she’s from Germany. So I never expected anything.

Allow me to rexplain better one of my first detailed posts on ET’s here caused her (I guess) to contact me on Instagram the next day! Those two apps are not connected at all, either I’m astronomically lucky. Or my theory was right. 

Anyway she tells me she’s flying to me to meet me and perhaps (if she likes me) start a family.

I’m as shocked as all of you. I have dealt with many liars and thieves in the past. This is real. And I’ll post a picture to prove it soon. Well as soon as I can.

Last point is since we live (our souls, essence) exists for an eternity, there is no rush or hurry to get life right the first time. To be honest we have already existed in another life form, and possibly on a different planet in a possible different universe. We got all the time in the world. There is no perfect existence till you realize we are all connected to the same loving life force. There’s no rush. Every soul will eventually learn the truth about the universe. 

Basically the whole point is when I started showing love to everyone. Great/amazing things started happening for me. I am truly shocked and amazed by all this love! And don’t worry, I love you too! I hope you get everything uve ever wanted or needed!","Guys, this is crazy."

So with that in mind, if other races have been visiting Earth for a long time, what is their intention in your opinion? Just to observe and monitor? To plan a future first contact with us?

aliens,"Both my mom and my dad seem to have experienced an unexplainable, synchronized episode about 20 years back. My mom had said that she had no doubt in her mind that both her and my dad had had an experience with extraterrestrial life. Knowing my mom, I let her begin her story but I was low key shaking my head. She is a believer in all things unworldly and was gifted a strong sensitivity to spirits. My dad on the other hand is a very grounded, level-headed guy....Not really into the wishy-washy and conspiracies, so when she told me that my dad had experienced the exact same thing as she did one night, I knew there had to be some truth to this experience they shared.

It was around 20 years ago. My mom explained to me that her and my dad had gotten into bed and fell asleep, just like any other night. After what seemed like a few hours of sleep, they both recalled becoming conscious of their surroundings but both feeling completely paralyzed. Neither of them have had past problems sleeping/experiencing sleep paralysis, so this was weird for them both. As they both laid in bed paralyzed, they both explained then how bright lights filled the room to the point of it being completely blinding. My mom and dad both had said this experience/dream had seemed to have gone on forever. 

Not only were they both laying in bed paralyzed with blinding lights filling up the whole room, making it unrecognizable, they both explained that they had been probed. My mom said there wasn’t a doubt in her mind. 

But this is where it gets weird. My mom had the experience of having her brain probed. She said she remembered the pain but couldn’t scream or move. My dad had been embarrassed to tell my mom that he experienced being probed through his anal cavity. He had said it was the most uncomfortable, terrifying situation he’s ever endured. To this day, they both have no idea what the hell happened that night. Nothing could explain it. And the fact that they BOTH experienced it is what freaks me out the most. 

Fast forward to the future....my mom, for the past 10 years, has suffered from neurological issues. Some days worse than others. My dad, 2 years ago, had been diagnosed with rectal cancer. He’s a survivor as of recent, but think about it. They both shared this terrifying experience years ago... mom said to have been probed through her brain and ends up having awful neurological issues down the road (doesn’t run in the family), and my dad, who was embarrassed to say he felt like they had probed him up his anus, ended up being diagnosed with rectal cancer (also doesn’t run in his family).

aliens,"The concept of visiting ""Reptilians"" is very popular amongst alleged abductees, remote viewers, psychonauts, amongst others. Now, assuming that these are real valid sightings of actual entities, I was trying to conceptualize who or what they could be.

We have reptiles here on Earth!

But what if they're not from elsewhere, but elsewhen? What if parallel realities are real, and some advanced races have figured out how to jump between realities? What if the dinosaurs never died out in one of these realities, but survived and evolved into an advanced race. Would they not appear to us as intelligent, likely bipedal reptilian humanoids?

Considering the number of extinction level events that have occurred on earth the likelihood of another intelligent civilization (presumably one vastly more advanced than us) existing at the same time as us is highly unlikely. However what isn’t unlikely is that another intelligent civilization did exist in the past and, like humans, they created AI. And perhaps they avoided extinction long enough to create a Singularity type AI. It is likely that once we create the singularity it will start to unlock realms of physics us humans could barely begin to understand. If the aliens created a singularity it is not at all impossible that the singularity has created drones to gather data on the universe. Which is what these mysterious UFOs could be. Keep in mind ufos seem to defy our current understanding of what is possible with an aircraft.

Maybe through the implants when sleeping, just have been mocked. eg, words feeling like came out of my mouth ""feed me"". In a mocking attitude. Someone made that happen with the implants pretty much.

Hear things like (in an elitist voice) ""CO2 is good for the atmosphere"", then maybe reply with 'no' -- then hear ""GOOOOOD!"". Just keep taunting me.

When sleeping just things that make me feel uncomfortable, in a mocking way.

Basically kinda like this: [https://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/12/11/narcissists-torture-others-believe-theyre-right/](https://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/12/11/narcissists-torture-others-believe-theyre-right/)

&amp;#x200B;

People that act like that.

&amp;#x200B;

These people by the way, seem to have the stuff like reptilian bodies, grey bodies, etc. Warp drive stuff. And use it to torture people with. Basically use someone and if they don't go along -- torture and stuff. If just do what ever say, then basically used as a pawn.

These implants, constantly, just if I do something that maybe it seems someone listening in doesn't like -- literally feel liquid rushing on either side of ear, in brain, and that makes me slow down, brain gets cloudy. Like a slight ringing in ear, maybe get loud I think maybe to do with someone else peering in, ringing just fluctuates probably because of that.

I see on the internet a lot of 'alien stuff', and just gathering a lot of stuff, seems like people that abduct and stuff intentionally put terrible stuff on the internet, stuff to intentionally get people to get hurt. Like seen some stuff like ""yeah alien stuff, by the way go praise Trump"". Basically it seems people secretly know that's probably ridiculous and just say things to get people to jump off a cliff kind of thing.

And when I've been listening in to an interview online, someone apparently talked about someone that'd would probably have abducted say something like this ""a virus will be released into the atmosphere"". Way before covid-19, I think a couple years ago.

I've heard about some apparent abductor person say ""the population needs to be culled"".

Just it seems just a hierarchy of sorts that abduct people and stuff. Just wanting to let know about this.

Basically it seems these people just intentionally abuse victims and if the victim are fooled, maybe the abuser just heavily manipulate and stuff, drugging with implants - feel 'good' feelings, etc - intentionally say the wrong things that the victim probably doesn't think too much of. And just maybe say thinks like to step on other victims, thus perhaps just then becomes the abuser too. Basically what I think that hierarchy are of.

It's just kinda hard to think - kinda cloudy. May be hard to read I guess.

I've heard an interview of someone that apparently does a lot -- open about talking about stuff, apparently there was a glass half full of water or something and then promptly yelled at a grey person to fill it back up. So. Just abusive attitude towards others it seems perhaps.

So, yeah. It seems a lot of hateful - ignorant attitude out there.

Maybe think to manipulate people, torture, mock, ignore. Just because don't think that way? I think instead should look out for each other and care about each other -- otherwise won't be friends.","I am so freaking helpless.

aliens,[deleted],Body found with holes
aliens," Okay, I will explain everything to you, just keep in mind I will be using terminology from your species vocabulary and knowledge in physics, but to really understand the core of this all, I you need you to imagine matter for the States in can express in (Solid, Liquid, Gas and Plasma) and not for the elements that constitutes it. I will talk about these states as: Earth, Water, Air and Fire. And you will also have to do something rather spiritual: You need to understand that you're an Earth and Water being. Made of Flesh and Blood. Solid and Liquid. 

 Now, Solid behaves a certain way; Imagine grains of sand floating in space, the only time they're doing something is when they hit another particle, stick to one another or when they're attracted to a bigger object.   
   
 And Liquid, while also being made of tiny ""grains"" of matter, Atoms, that ""stick"" to each other, also allows things to slide between. 

   
 When you interact with Solid, Matter, Earth you either add, take or transform a piece of it. Between the space between these ""grains of matter"" stuff can go through, but it depends of the ""tightness"" of their bonds.   
   
 With Liquid, Water you interact with and that interaction spreads across it. Simply by tapping in the surface of the water you can see how an energy as simply as kinetic energy spreads freely in waves. And you can see it because Water is also made of tiny grains of matter. These are Waves of Matter.   


 There are also Waves of Energy. These waves move in space time free from the need of matter. There are a whole bunch of types from sunlight, to microwaves, radio waves, x rays and the most powerful known: Gamma Rays. These type of energy can be harvested and used.

 But Humans cant see all types of energy, you can feel it though, like the warmth of the sun in a day of summer, which is a different type of energy from the light you see. The Water inside you is doing the same, is spreading energy through your body. 

   
 Bubbling from bottom to top there is Free Matter, Gas, Air. It constitutes and is between most of matter but concentrates on top of Earth and Water. Notice how the freedom of the Atoms is evergrowing, Freedom is the Energy they carry, and it is Movement. From bottom to top. Earth, Water, Air. The Three Main Elements of biological life. The Three Mediums for energy to spread through, the Three Main States of Matter found on the surface of planets like yours. 

   
This is what you are Human, a Triad of Sand made conscious, standing on itself in the middle of space time, floating everlasting in the dance of defiance against entropy. Oh Entropy, the one that takes apart everything from eachother. It gives room for things to grow, and implies death in the near or distant future, but death nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

 But Humans, you forgot. Sweet stardust child, haven't you look up? Haven't you see the Sun that shines in the DaySky, and her Star sisters in the distance? Haven't you realize what Stars do? They're the builders of the Defiance, they are the Almighty Queens that created the Castles you live in. 

 Oh but besides almighty, besides their godliness, they're mortal as you. And they are born, they eat, they grow and they die. They're the Fourth Kind of Matter, Fire, and the ones that create a massive body so it can withstand the eternal hug of the Ultimate Element, Light, the most pure form of Energy there is.

&amp;#x200B;

 And Fire is also down here, always coming from the sky, from the Lighting, to the Borealis, to the one you took for yourself, the Ignis, corresponding to Electricity, Plasma and Fire itself. This Concept of Fire is Energy Incarnating Matter. 

 You Human are different, something in you is a source of Defiance, you call it Imagination, the ability to foresee possibly futures and plan accordingly, the Gift of Creating things that didn't exist before. The Magical Power of taking things from the future and drag them into the present. You took the Fire, you became Defiance, you're now a Tetra Elemental Being and one that can Create and Fight Entropy. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The Power Given to you could not be greater Human. 

 Now see upon your biding, is this the planet such powerful being would create?. Have your forgotten the Elements that you are and where they come from? Did the Future became such an addiction to you Star Dust Child? 

 Humble down and give up the power, or bite your Pride off your Soul. 

 Too many centuries obeying your Sins Humans, now its time to build a civilization based on Virtues. 

 Global Culture knows the old psychological constructs named Seven Deadly Sins, but how many of you can name the Seven Pure Virtues? 

&amp;#x200B;

 The Fifth Element is awaiting for you. 

 Light itself is awaiting for you. 

 But without a mind that can handle it, Light only blinds and burns. 

&amp;#x200B;

But beware weak Earth being, as SpaceTime itself is the Sixth Element, and Entropy runs through it like your Blood runs through your veins. And like Water carries Energy, Entropy carries The Seventh Element: Happening, Existence itself, the One that create, destroys and IS, for all across the Universe, forever.

 

 You might start thinking weird now, all of this sounds indeed weird, inst it? Familiar yet.. Not. You knew this once upon a time, when you believed in Magic and Dreams, when you used to look upon the sky and bury your Feet in the Grass. 

&amp;#x200B;

 And yet, here is your last big question in physics Human, laughing right at you: Consciousness. How is that in the limit between matter and energy, in the limit of what exist, you observe that the fundamental nature and values of a Single Infinitesimal Tiny Grain of Sand are determined the moment that they became able to. That is because the Seventh Element, Existence, is essentially the closest to your idea of a God Human, it impregnates every single piece of matter, energy and space time. It IS at everytime, everywhere, watching and being all things. 

&amp;#x200B;

 And Child, this God of yours, you made it at your own image because He/She/It is also mortal. 

 It is across all the Universe, it IS all the Universe yet is being torn apart by Entropy and one day, after you are dust, after your planet dissapears and your stars becomes ashes; after all that God once was is gone, and even his empty spacetime corpse starts vanishing. Then the End will come, True Death will put an end to the faint echoes of your radiowaves screams and a new canvas for a Master Piece will begin. The numbers that controlled the forces that set the settings for all of what universe was will be readjusted and put in motion for a new beginning. All the constants of physics, taking from a palette with a brush, painting galaxies, or new algorithms in the program, simulating a new video game. Whatever suits your mind Human, reality is not difficult to understand, its difficult to feel, incarnate and enjoy. Just that. Thats what you're after all, piece of Mud with Feelings.

aliens,"I want to propose an interesting theory that i came up with. I believe that we were created but not by who we think it is. I believe that we were created by something very advanced. Something that has far more knowledge that we can possibly imagine. I think that those beings created us in a very basic form very long ago. Something more basic than homosapiens. I think that they created us in this basic form and put us here on earth knowing that we would evolve into what we are now. I think that they gave us things like Jesus and the Bible so that we can have something to believe in. They provided these things so that it can answer our questions that we have about our existence. There is a reason why seeing God as our creator doesn’t really add up. But, if you think about it, evolution doesn’t add up either. We couldn’t have just came from nothing. Something has to have put us here. But also being made out of mud how the bible says doesn't make sense either. Which leads to my theory: we were made by something very advanced that played the role of god. But it isn't the god that we worship. “God” is actual beings with god like intelligence and technology.",Aliens made us

aliens,"When Oumuamu passed in 2017 (when more information was put out) I always thought it was strange. Later on, I started to think it **could've been** something else than a comet. I found that when it was leaving the solar system, it conveniently let out gas as if it was speeding up. 

People started talking about that, spreading rumors, and commented about the strange shape of the ""comet"". Of course, the talk died down as people moved on, but now -- we are seeing a resurgence in this talk -- why? 

Well, now we are seeing multiple articles by some people of Harvard claiming what I was thinking years ago. Now, those talks are dominant. We may never know, but now I'm starting to tip the scales on whether this thing could be **alien in nature**. 

Until evidence proves otherwise, I find the ""letting out gas"" that defies explanation with its shape -- the comet flew around the solar system, and then, when it wanted to leave, used the propulsion and disappeared.  

Was it taking pictures of us -- spying on us -- replicating through the solar system (as one theory said about another topic) or was it just a dumb probe? All of these things are breathtaking and scary. For the latter, that means we are not alone; that we have certain probes that have discovered us and could be monitoring us (even if the UFOs weren't real). 

With space-time, maybe the communications haven't reached an Alien or whatever, but if it is a spacecraft (and I'm not trying to go overly-conspiratorial), it is an unbelievable moment. We didn't find the aliens, they found us.  

Though, what do you think? I'm just spitballing at this point because more research needs to be done -- though this is a big deal if more talk is being done over something that has passed us for a few years at this point.",Aliens and Oumuamu?

Where are the aliens?"" also explained as ""If there are all these billions of planets in the universe that are capable of supporting life, and millions of intelligent species out there, then how come none has visited earth?"". 

Now, this supports the fact that there is another dimension with alien-like creatures or just basically another species that is intelligent enough to observe us from their dimension that we, humans, can't see because we're in our own dimension. Where are everyone? How come we've never seen any other species? Yes, we've seen UFO's and other unexplainable things, but this is what makes the most sense. How can it be that we've never interacted with one before? The Earth has been around for so long, we've had more than enough time to find aliens! Where are they? I'll tell you...they are hiding in another dimension. Hiding away from us to observe us. Our every move. They might be standing in your room right now, looking at you and taking notes. They are much more intelligent than we are. Some have said, that UFO's are humans from the future traveling back to see how the past was. Usually they're invisible, but sometimes things go wrong, as they do, and they revealed themselves. This is why UFO sightings date back to the Stone Age. It's us! Even if there is aliens out there, they'd be looking at dinosaurs. That could an explanation as to why they have never visited us.",The Fermi Paradox - Aliens from another dimension
aliens,"Hey everyone,

As per the post title our good friend 5c_attica has removed/deleted their account.

I appreciate before anyone starts that many believed she was a troll but others disagree.

I personally have no idea.

For anyone not understanding what the hell I am talking about, a user with the account 5c_attica was essentially disclosing info related to ufos, UAP’s, BAE etc. 

Was there any proof ? Not really

Was there anything meaningful discussed? YES

Did it involve opening up the rabbit hole? YES

User was pretty cool to be honest, mentioned amongst other things that there would be some news relating to UAP’s this January involving Chile and the US.

Please discuss, mods please do not close. I think a general discussion would be useful and entertaining.

As you know the previous posts received a lot of traction and interest.

Not only that, but peoples research skills also increased on the subject regardless of whether it was fact or fiction.","Potential CIA employee- 5c_attica account no longer exists, did we get fooled - let’s discuss, Chile news a lie?"

I dreamt that an alien species contacted us via some kind of strange device, a ball floating in the atmosphere that worked like a video projector.
It played a short film with a fixed image of space and snakes and a voice speaking in a Siri like manner.
It said that we were all worms we were worthless
And that were on their way to invade us.
They said that they were going to do everything they can in order to make us suffer the most

It lasted about 10 seconds before it had started to fade out and I really doubt that it was a helicopter or plane because I near a hospital and I often hear helicopters flying over. It also couldn’t have been a plane since all the planes that fly that low near me are at a near R.A.F base and that was in the opposite direction to where I heard the noise.

What I find interesting is these two seemingly different points of data. But think about!

Shortly after the beginning of the nuclear age, we notice a huge influx of alien activity all over earth. Why? 

Because the radiation emitted from the blasts would travel at Light Speed throughout the universe. 

So what? 

Well, a few years after the blasts we notice this activity. Amounting to 2-10 Light years of light traveled.

What is in that range? 

Alpha Centauri.

aliens,,"In the night sky above Lima, Peru April 5, 2020"
aliens,"the events took place approximately 8 years ago. the place was uk, scotland,  wemyss bay, skelmorlie. I don't know this areaat all.  it involves only myself and i have never before presented the details orally or written.  i've mentioned my thoughts on possibilities of what i think may have happened to me to my girlfriend and close friends in in a half hearted manner but i think due to my sobre/straight nature it's always dismissed as me making a crap joke. 

i will now attempt to tell my tale:   as i said it took place about 8 years ago when i was about 42/43. my partner and i had flown up to glasgow from bristol to spend new year with some very close friends.  i'm very unfamiliar with where i was staying; it was a large victorian house in a small coastal village. it's a large house on a fairly minor road in the centre of the village.  there are many houses on the street and they are all old and large.  the winter was a particularly cold one, infact extremely cold. so much snow infact, the airport was closed for a few days.  i guess we were staying there for 5 days and this particular event took place on new years eve.  

we had gone to a local pub and returned back to our friends house for a small gathering.  i hadn't really had that much to drink, and i remember most of the evening up to a certain point. my last memory was being in an upstairs room chatting with my partner, and my mates brother who is a commercial airline pilot.  there were also a couple of other people that i don't know so well - it would have been about 1a.m/2a.m

and then nothing

the next thing i'm aware of is it's dark.  i am stood in a room. i can vaguely make out items of furniture that look ornate and unfamiliar.  i remember a chaise longue, i remember a fire place and the room is warm. i then start to hear voices.  the voices become louder and then i become aware of shouting; people shouting at me, demanding to know what i'm doing, why i'm there and how did i get in.  i'm confused. very confused. i've no idea where i am. nothing looks familiar. no-one is recognisable. i keep asking where i am. there is much confusion going on. more people come into the room, voices become more raised; i get the hint that some of the guys there are starting to get aggressive in their questioning.  i am completely bewildered, i believe i was in shock, i have absolutely no idea where i am - nothing is recognisable.  i sense the air of aggression i apologise over and over saying i mean no harm. i think i remember 1 of the girls being sympathetic however, a couple of the guys demanded i leave immediately. i get shown to the door as its opened for me to leave. as i look outside i see nothing, no lights, just a track leading into the trees. i try to explain i don't know where to go - one guy was screaming at me to fuck off and just go, amongst the shouts of abuse i could hear someone telling me to follow the track down to the main road.  i walked out and down the track through the trees, on into the darkness.  i'm scared. i dont know whats happening, i don't know why i'm here.  i don't know where here is.   i don't know where i've come from or where i'm going

there was snow everywhere. it was so cold. i had no coat and it was minus 15 degrees celcius.  i believe at that stage my only concern was to get away from possible violence.  i've no idea which direction i walked in. as i walked through the darkness i became aware of just how cold i was. i was FREEZING. like i said i had no coat, i don't think i have ever experienced such cold.  i can't remember how long it was but eventually i saw headlights - i waved my arms for the car to stop and it was a taxi!  i remember getting in the cab and thanking the driver for what felt like he was saving my life.  it was the first time in quite awhile that i felt safe, however when the driver asked me where i wanted to go, i had no idea.  my mind was blank. i had no idea where i wanted to go. i had no idea where i was.  i remember the taximan asking if i had money - i had £10 on me and we agreed that he'd drive around until the money ran out and see if anything jogged my memory.  after not very long the meter ran up to £10 and the driver said he'd have to drop me off.  i pleaded with him that i couldnt go back into the cold and out of concern he took me to the nearest police station.  

it wasnt a proper police station - it was one of these country police stations that is more like someones house.  anyhow there happened to be a couple of police officers in a car outside the building. the taximan filled them in on me. i remember we went into this room which i think was somewhere where they kept uniforms and general equipment/supplies.  i think i kept apologising for wasting their time blah blah blah, anyhow when they asked me my details i could not for the life of me remember my name. i didnt know where i was from. i couldnt remember my address - not even the city.  i couldnt tell them where and who i was staying with. i remember i could tell them where i was born but no details more than this. i then started to become very upset. i believe i started hyper ventilating. i remember sobbing asking the police why i didnt know who i was or where i was from.  

the police called the paramedics. i was put in the back of an ambulance. one of the medics found my phone in my pocket but it had no power however they had a charger and when he got it working he phoned the number that was the most used and thankfully it was my girlfriends number - she answered and told them where i should be. the medics checked me over and found the only concern was i was hypothermic. i said i did not want to go to hospital so kindly they drove me back to my friends where we were staying. i think it was now about 8.30am - when we pulled up at my friends place, i saw my girlfriend and it was as if all these memories came flooding back like it was a rush. i threw up a few times

so my partner and friends tried to understand where i had been all night  - i explained to them the house that i had been in and it seems it was this old property i think may have been owned by the ymca and they rented it out to holiday makers. its surrounded by trees and is at the other end of skelmorlie to where we were staying. at the time it never really made sense as to why i ended up there and how! it was put down to me probably doing some psycho active drugs, maybe mushrooms or E's/skunk and too much alcohol, but i know that was not the case.  my last real memory of being at my friends house i felt quite sobre - i remember having a fairly sobre conversation with my mates brother, the pilot.

i think of this night often. one memory that came back was of me being shown something. what ever it was, this something had the most beautiful absorbing colours that captivated me. i have the memory of being with someone where we didnt have a conversation as such but they were showing me something and i could see these colours swirling into each other. the being with me was goodlooking. i couldnt for sure say if it was male or female but i get the feeling it was a feminine being. we were somewhere very quiet and there was an air of tranquility and safeness.  i was speaking to this being but i'm not sure that i was actually saying the words or if i was just thinking them but it was along the lines of how everything that i was being shown was perfection

i wish i could remember more.

anyhow the reason i have come here to pass my story on is that i hoped by typing this out it might have jogged my memory and also i have read or listened to someones story that made me think maybe i too was abducted

the rationale for this is why on earth i would set off on a journey across the village without a coat or anything warm on perhaps the coldest night of the year

there were similarities to my friends house and the house that i found myself in.  i don't know this part of the country at all - its a mystery how i could have found this holiday house and found my way into the house.  the house isnt visible from the road- could i have been delivered to the wrong house by mistake

what happened to my memory?

who was this other being and what were they showing me",curious case of being lost in the night

I've read in certain cases when people encounter UFOs/get abducted, they'll notice that they have hours of time that can't be explained and will witness weird manipulations of clocks. I've experienced both. 

This morning I woke up and noticed that the time felt... weird... I looked at my bedside alarm clock and it said it was 9am, but then I looked at my phone and it said it was 10am... Again, I looked at my computer and it said it was 3pm, but my car said it was 2pm. What happened to that unexplainable missing hour of time?? What happened to the clocks in my house and car????

aliens,"Although this list is not exhaustive since I have read such stories countless times, I think there is enough material here to firmly establish that the ""Men in Black"" in fact exist. I would define the Men in Black as an official or unofficial group of government agents that confiscate as much of the best UFO evidence as they can. 

Perhaps the most insane example is Roswell 1947 in which civilians and radio show hosts were threatened with death or loss of employment, and UFO crash debris was switched out with weather balloon wreckage. This backed up by tons of first hand testimony from people directly involved, but I'm sure most here are already aware of this. The rest of this post will be lesser-known incidents that follow the same modus operandi. 

- Former Phoenix City Councilwoman, Frances Barwood, discusses her unexpected role in the startling mass sighting that occurred over Arizona in 1997, commonly referred to as the ""Phoenix Lights."" A man by the name of Richard Curtis filmed the craft with professional equipment and wanted to make a copy of the footage for Barwood. Before he could make a copy, several men in black suits showed up at his residence claiming to be from Barwood's office and they wanted the original footage. They claimed they would make copies, then return the original. Curtis called Barwood weeks later and asked if she received the footage, but she didn't and said she only had several female staffers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj50i3GcTQE

- In 1956, Rex Heflin took 4 photographs of a UFO in one of the most famous UFO cases. The copy negatives were obtained from Heflin under false pretenses by someone pretending to be from the North American Air Defense Command. 32 years later, they were strangely mailed back to Heflin, confirming that the ""model and string"" debunking was nonsense. http://www.nicap.org/reports/heflinhall.htm

- High level FAA whistleblower John Callahan says government agents confiscated a bunch of evidence from a 1986 UFO case he was involved in, and the agents told everyone ""this didn't happen."" He made copies of the evidence and released this publicly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WTid3O0VE

- Nick Pope on the Missing Calvine UFO photo: *""The Calvine UFO photo is the most spectacular UFO photo ever sent to the Ministry of Defence. It's also missing...There was a running joke that we didn’t care if a craft such as the one shown in the Calvine UFO photo was American, Russian or Martian – all we knew was that it was better than anything we had and that we wanted the technology for our own military aircraft and drones...  I asked my DIS opposite number about the image. I was told that the official assessment was that the photos were real and the craft had a diameter of around 25 metres (over 80 feet). At one particularly surreal briefing on the UFO phenomenon my DIS opposite number indicated the photo and pointed his finger to the right: “It’s not the Americans”, he said, before pointing to the left and saying “and it’s not the Russians”. There was a pause, before he concluded “and that only leaves …” - his voice trailed off and he didn’t complete the sentence, but his finger was pointing directly upwards... What happened next? The suspicion was that someone had shredded the photo, but whatever the truth of the matter, it was never seen again...  I don't know if the photos or negatives will ever turn up, but I certainly hope they do. Because whatever peoples’ views on UFOs, these are the photos that changed the minds of numerous skeptical civil servants, military personnel and intelligence specialists at MoD. I should know. I was one of them.""* http://www.nickpope.net/calvine-ufo-photo.htm

I even found one for the Soviet Union:

- Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev said a UFO turned toward him in space and followed him. He photographed it, but had his film and cameras confiscated. He told his story only due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and he thought he could begin to talk about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0S4M_aFYCM&amp;list=PLtxuWiIWctJuNApl1R-HDdOjR5_u4_xR2&amp;index=3","Here is a list of some incidents in which government agents confiscated photographs, video, or other UFO evidence."

If half of the stuff is true we are gonna have a wild ride for humanity in the next few decades. It makes me not want to go into all the little conspiracy’s as much because people debunk them but is it really our government making us think it’s aliens and that’s why it can be debunked.

aliens,"Located in the Nazca Desert in Southern Peru is a series of incredible geoglyphs, etched into the arid surface sometime between 500 BCE and 500 CE.

Believed to have been created by the Nazca Culture, the intricate lines, symbols and animal glyphs run for several kilometers.

The combined length of all the lines is over 1,300 km (808 mi), and the group covers an area of about 50 square kilometers (19 sq mi). The lines are typically 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep.

The curious symbols were created by the ancients who would remove the top layer of the reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles revealing a yellow-grey subsoil.

The largest Nazca lines are about 370 m (1,200 ft) long.

Experts have cataloged more than 800 straight lines, around 300 geometric figures and as many as 70 biomorphs; designs of animals and plants.

The ancient Nazca people flourished in the arid region of Sothern Peru between the 1st and 8th century A.D.

The first mention of the Nazca lines can be traced back to Pedro Cieza de León, a Spanish conquistador, and chronicler of Peru, in his book of 1553, where he mistook them for trail markers.

The lines have been studied for decades.

Paul Kosok, an American historian from the Long Island University, is credited as the first scientist to properly study the Nazca Lines.

The exact reason why the Nazca created intricate symbols, lines, and biomorphs remains a mystery, although one theory argues the ancients created them to be seen by the ‘deities’ in the sky.

Some researchers have proposed that the Nazca lines were created with a connection to astronomy and cosmology, and were intended to act as a sort of an ancient observatory, to point to distant places in the horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies (planets) rose or set during astronomical events like solstices.

There are others who argue that the lines could indicate water flor or even irrigation schemes, or may even be part of an ancient ritual to summon water.

Phyllis Pitluga, a senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium performed computer models of star alignments and argues that the giant spider at Nazca is an anamorphic diagram of the constellation Orion.

Many theories but not one that has been generally agreed upon.

And while experts have wondered for decades what the Nazca lines meant, why they were created, and what message the ancients were trying to convey, a YouTuber has created a massive map and plotted the entire Nazca lines around the globe.

Using Google Earth, the YouTuber found that if you plot the Nazca Lines over the entire planet, they convey at one specific point: Angkor Wat, an ancient temple complex in Cambodia, and curiously, one of the largest religious monuments ever erected on Earth, with an area of 162.6 hectares.
What he discovered was an antipodal point.

In mathematics, the antipodal point of a point on the surface of a sphere is the point which is diametrically opposite to it.

Call it coincidence or not, it certainly is interesting to see the Nazca lines from this perspective.",The mysterious Nazca Lines.

aliens,"The first time I saw what I believe was a real ufo, happened last year. My girlfriend and I went to the beach real late at night, I think like 2am. We were chilling for a while then out of no where, far out in the ocean we saw this green light rise straight up and hover in place. It was like a triangle, with green lights on each end. 

The way it moved shocked me. It just moved across the sky like nothing. It’s like it moved as fast as a mouse curser going across the screen with no resistance when it changes direction. It then flew straight over us, and never returned. I know for a fact is wasn’t a drone or a plane. Just that way it moved, I will never forget. It was so far out in the ocean, I mean extremely far out, and the incredible speed it had, just zipped right over us.

I wish I recorded but it happened so fast and I was shocked. I just hope that I can witness this again. I am lost for words trying to explain this thing.","I will never forget. (Jensen beach, FL)"
aliens,"When I was younger, I was really really scared of the dark, it stopped when I was around 18 years old.
 (I started facing my fears, forced myself to be in the dark, checked every scary sounds, and i'm a big boy now)

I never told these stories to anyone except my current girlfriend, She told me She never heard of a creature like this, I was watching Alien/paranormal/creature groups for 5 years, no one posted an expereince like this, not even close, so, i'm coming out of the bush, and I will share my 2 stories (I have more, but I only belive these 2 situations were real)


First one:

I was at my fathers 2 floor house, my uncle lives at the first floor, my father, his gf, and me were on the second floor.

The only way to come up, is a stairway, and i can see, hear, literally feel the vibration of the steps when even my little 6 year old sister comes up, and the door is like half glass, and is facing the bed I sleep.

So, I was 16, and i woke up in the middle of the night, and remembering back, it was kind of strange from the beginning.

I was not afraid of the dark, and i was not tired. That was quite strange, i woke up in 0.1 sec, and I was looking at the door, for a very long time, I always did this when i had a bad dream, or was not able to sleep, but not that day. For some reason I wanted to go out, full dark night, not even the moon was out. 

And I was not scared. There was no way in hell i wanted to to outside, even with company, yet, i wanted to go outside alone, no goal in mind, I just stared at the door, the night, and I got up, and something felt off. I was not really feeling anything, i was not moving my body, at least not with my mind. Do you know that feeling when a muscle starts moving rapidly, without your brains ""consent""?
That is the feeling, I was just moveing. 

But i was not scared. I was kind of happy, i knew im going outside. 

And i was, indeed going outside, I opened a door, to the terrace where the stairway is, got out and.... I was back in charge. I looked at the stars, they were so nice, but i started to feel scared, so I wanted to go inside, i turned from the sky, and I saw it.

It was darker than the dark night, yet, there was something shiny, something colourfull like oil that comes out of the car, to the road.

It was just standig there, looking at me. And it was moving. Not the creature, the colours on it. And the shape followed, it had very rough shapes around it, all moving in a random way, and i was not scared. I felt something new i never felt before, and will probably never will. 

One thing for sure, it wanted me to see, maybe introduced, no idea.

After what felt like 10 years but probably was a few seconds me looking down, the creature looking up, i felt nothing, and everything was black.

I woke up the next day, because my dad was pouring water on my face, and it was already kind of getting dark, and he told me I slept for like 18 hours and he got worried. 

I'm 22 now, and I think about it a lot of times. I saw strange things, a fridge moving half a meter in my friends"" haunted "" house, but I always tried to make up a logical thing to explain, but this... I can't.

I really tried, if i saw at least someone with similar experience, I can be like, yeah if im not alone in this, maybe it's just a mental disorder, or I was daydreaming, or I was living my dream, but... The reason I post this is, I finally belive it happened. 

But if it happened...
Why did it show itself to me?
Why did i black out?
Why was i not controlling myself?
Why is there nothing like that creature, nothing looks even close to it.",I was visited twice when I was younger. (probably)
aliens,"The first one that I know of was 5 years ago on Kimmel 

https://youtu.be/EYzRY2XpLBk

Hopefully this video will speak for itself. Kimmel asks him about ufos and at first he's evasive dodging the question with a joke. But when pressed he sort of caves and jokingly says they have strict control over us. 

Kimmel then points out that people will read his expressions. I feel like this is important because I believe he purposely gives of a lot of signs of a liar. Closed eyes, forced expression and nodding,  his tone of voice even seems stressed. 

I always thought this was cool and powerful to me but it got neat when I saw I separate video Obama did with colbert 3 months ago.

https://youtu.be/V-Q8MFjlQ2Y

Skip to 9:26 of the video

So here it becomes a little too synchronistic. Obama pressed again by colbert and he again has the same response. Same sort of facial expressions. He says he knows and I'm sorry but I can't tell you.

Colbert points out if there was nothing you'd just say no.


Now where this gets really interesting and coincidental to me is that this interview with Colbert comes out in the same week that the isreali space chief came out about the galactic federation. 

In the second interview Obama also  says roswell is a drop of bucket to whats people are saying  is happening today and you can go ahead and believe that. 

It's because of this I very much believe we are In the process of disclosure. That these were planned leaks coordinated across governments. I believe aliens are here and have been here


Also. Val valient thor mentioned a galactic federation. And was ""from Venus"". But we now know Venus shows signs of life and val said they didn't live on the surface. 

If you Google val valiant thor all you get is pinterests results. Wtf is up with that?

I think we're supposed to think it's a fairtale but there's some relevant stuff there too

aliens,"I’m not saying my religion is aliens, but my previous beliefs sort of look different now that I genuinely believe aliens are real.",The more I research and read about aliens the more I feel like I’m starting to believe in a new religion. Does anyone else feel this way?
aliens,"This is something I have flipped and flopped over thoughout my whole life. We can see here on Earth, species that are very very distantly related will evolve into the same forms, behaviors, even the sounds that they make are identical. Take the placental and marsupial wolf for example. Not only that, but Earth developed organic life almost immediately after water stabalized into a liquid state and the temperature shifted. 


So, how likely would it be that ""civilized"" aliens like ourselves resemble human beings in some shape or form? It seems as if all alien races we assume to be intelligent are strikingly similar in biology to humans - and a galaxy like Star Trek seems increasingly likely. Gravity would be a pivitol factor, I would think, in a species physical appearance.


Then again it makes me consider the possibility that these humanesque aliens people report, such as arcturians and pleidians, are rather archetypes or beings that reside deep within the processes of the human mind, like elves or angels in folklore and myth.",Convergent Evolution

aliens,"I saw it last night and it is for sure one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a while. The concept was of aliens landing in Johannesburg, SA and due to the negative reaction of the people there, they were put into segregation, also known as District 9. The movie was set at a time when District 10 was being created, and the aliens were being forcefully evicted from their homes. A weapons company was pretty much behind this, for ""humanitarian reasons"". In reality they were &gt;!doing genetic experiments on the aliens, and trying to gain their weapons technology!&lt; . I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil the movie, but it's free to watch on Crackle rn, definitely check it out if you haven't already.

aliens,,"The Milky Way may be swarming with planets containing water and ice, this could change everything we think we know about life in the universe."
aliens,"I've been fascinated with the subject for countless years; I have no doubt that there is ADVANCED life out there somewhere. While we still know very little about our universe and things like dark matter remain a mystery, we do know SOME things. Universe expansion, drake equation; all these notions should make one at least consider the possibility. I've spent a lot of time researching it. My conclusion is that 99% of everything (even on this subreddit) is utter BS, either made-up or explainable as a natural pheomenon. Figures like Tom Delonge might have obtained some information but I am certain they are making a lot of shit up and frankly the guy is what I'd view as your typical conspiracy theorist material.

I am trying to keep an open mind due to SO MANY reports from the likes of Commander Fravor and even Bob Lazar but Delonge's claims seem more like some sci-fi ramblings of an individual who feels the need to satisfy his psychological motives rather than paradigm altering revelations supported by factual evidence.

I'll try to keep this brief and to be as on point as I possibly can. No X different species BS, I am so sick of it in this field. With that being said it is still all speculation.

\- We have indeed been visited by beings not of this world for a long, long time. Even if there were times in human history when OUR civilizations were more advanced than say us in the middle ages, our view and understanding of the world was very different. The point is, we knew almost nothing about these advanced beings and treated them as gods. With that being said, theories such as Ancient Aliens mostly involve guesswork along with pseudoscience and should be taken with a grain of salt.

\- Due to how information was exchanged till not that long ago and how we developed as a species with focus shifting away from religion and to scientific progress, the UFO/alien phenomenon was never treated seriously. There was no way for someone say a few decades ago not to mention even before that, to know about someone in a different region of the world experiencing something unusual. Or at the very least it was much harder to exchange information. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. If we have indeed been visited by other species, either they don't want us to know or they don't care; if they are capable of visting our planet, surely they have the technology to remain hidden from our perception, for the most part. Everyone makes mistakes and things no matter how advanced, break on occasion.

\- I feel like the end of World War 2 was a major moment for us as a species when we reached a certain threshold if you will. Think what would have happened if the war occured a decade later with nuclear fission already achieved... Then again, with no war we might have never been pushed to make such a discovery. These speculations are pointless for the most part but let me get to the point I am trying to make. If we were visited in ancient times and taught some things such as language, social constructs etc. which paved way for our consciousness, perhaps these advanced beings simply left and only checked on us occasionally. Then post-WW2 with the Cold War looming on the horizon and atom split, we became slightly more 'interesting' while still being the terrotrial primates that we are.

\- I think that technology not of this world did indeed crash at Rosewell and if so, it might not have been the first such crash throughout the planet's history. Might be that it was actually us humans trying to operate this technology hence the crash. Then again, if the said technology was obtained earlier, why wasn't it used in WW2 even if it was still not reverse engineered. If one had even a single craft capable of crossing any distance at an incredible speed, you'd think any technology would be utilized in a conflict of such importance. Maybe we were still unable to operate it even. I promised no BS though and I am starting to apply Tom Delonge's train of thought here which I ridiculed so let me get to the point; I think it is likely at some point we found an extremely advanced technology not of this world, BEYOND our understanding. While making everyone aware of such technology and not compartmentalizing it sounds like a good idea, I do understand that things can get more complicated and repercussions have to be considered. I think that this technology was indeed used to facilitate our progress and some of it was shelved since we need to advance more in other fields to be able to make any use of it. In theory, let's assume that we are in possession of a handful of crafts capable of things we can't even begin to imagine but we can't replicate them in any way, shape or form. We constantly study them and make some progress, slowly but steadily. Going into all the political/sociological/economical reasons as to why such technology might be problematic to our society warrants an entire separate post.

\- And now we get to probably the most sought after piece of information; direct contact with aliens. I think that this contact was very limited and remains very limited. I think that some governments are aware of them and that they are watching us but other than that very little is known, mostly we are trying to come up with theories and possible scenarios. Reptilian overlords are not a thing which brings me to the most annoying fact about all this: the amount of disinformation out there is INSANE and the funny thing is, people that wish to keep this information hidden don't have to do anything. You'd think that no matter what branch of the government would be involved in the cover-up, it would lack competence to withhold such information. This topic attracts a lot of mentally unstable attention seekers and it is one of the reasons why the scientific community is so reluctant to pursue it. I've read so many posts on this subreddit alone that were obviously nothing more than your average creative writing. AATIP is a thing though, there is no denying that. Let me ask you a question, how do you make the following information public: that the existence of aliens was a known fact for a few decades, remained hidden for so long and to this day very little is know about the said aliens? Yeah.

Let me tell you, I don't think we are going to get any official confirmation anytime soon. Like I said, whoever is visiting us, they are being subtle and possibly don't care if we are aware of them.

Perhaps a day will come when we are 'ready' but I'd say it is going to take at least a couple more generations.","My theory regarding what was/is really happening and the current state of ""things"""

One of the rabbit holes ive recently been researching is the argument that these beings are evil,mischevious interdimensional beings. There are hundreds of testimonies of aliens giving false information and causing fear and pain. The stories of alien abduction are identical to ""fairies"" and ""demons"" of the past. Jacques Vallee's research is some of the best imo. 

Albert Rosales also has put together great documentation of humanoid encounters. Some are relatively harmless yet ohers are outwright insane. I find it interesting that their appearance appears to relate to the decade their observed.

Why would an advanced race who claims they created us put us through fear and pain? Why do they take people in the middle of the night against their will? Why do they deny religion? 

Why do you think they are from far away and not interdimensional?",What are your arguments that aliens cannot be interdimensional and are actually coming from distance space?

There are two more specific reasons that are really important:

1- The non-woo one

Anti-gravity and Zero Point energy, while amazing technologies, literally world changing, are absolutely terrifying in the wrong hands. It's the whole ""nuclear power"" vs ""nuclear weapons"" conundrum again but times infinity. The possible rewards are almost unimaginable, but so are the risks. They would result in a totally new age for humankind, or it's end. 

(Look into: Harold E. Puthoff / Eric Davis / etc)

2- The woo one 

(If you don't believe in the more woo side of the phenomenon, at least being somewhat open to the idea, you just haven't looked into it enough yet)

Ending the secrecy would lead to more research into the phenomenon which eventually leads to telepathy.
With telepathy, you get again, a paradigm shift for our entire society. 

In simple terms: **No more secrets.**

Now, do you really think that the elites or any country's military would be OK with that?

Can you imagine a world where lies are a thing of the past, where people can feel what the less lucky in our society feel, what it feels to go hungry or the mental pain of victims of crimes and injustices?

(Look into: Michael Persinger / Ingo Swann (Don't dismiss until you look into his associates) / Harold E. Puthoff / etc)

aliens,"***Background***  
*We were having an interesting discussion about the abduction phenomenon here:  ihttps://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/o8joqk/the\_pentagon\_is\_playing\_dumb/h3653mp/?context=3  credits to*  u/throwahoyway*.* 

*Then I saw this comment from* u/dabswithit710*:*

&gt;*Finally someone brings up the abduction issue which is 100 percent valid and not discussed enough. You are totally right.*

u/dabswithit710 *is right. Everybody is talking about UFOS, it's however strange that the abduction phenomenon is rarely discussed. It inspired me to turn my comment into post.*

In the past few weeks a lot has been said/confirmed about the UFO phenomenon. The USG/DOD has finally ""very carefully admitted"" the phenomenon is real. They claim they don't know much and need even more MONEY in order to find out what's going on. This of course is absolutely laughable. Why, why on earth, after 75+ years, does it seem so difficult for the USG/DOD to tell us what's going on? Actually no world government has ever informed it's citizens what they really know/think about UFO's or the abduction phenomenon. 

The more I think about it, the more if feel there's a good reason, why governments around the world are hesitant to inform us what they really know. If you were to confirm the UFO phenomenon is real, you could also argue the abduction phenomenon also might be just as real. If the government admits UFOS are real, it won't take long before people will start to ask the government what it knows about abductions.

If they cannot protect our restricted airspaces from UFOS, do you really think they can protect citizens from abductions? The more I think about it, the more I feel, it's precisely this the USG/DOD fears most. Having to admit they can't protect us..... Perhaps this is what National Security really is about. It might be the government is keenly aware of what's going. 

The government is never going to tell us, another advanced species is experimenting on human beings, the same way we are experimenting on various (lab) animals. And there's nothing the USG/DOD can do to stop this from happening. For most people, This would be a very somber reality to deal with.

What i want to say is my grandma lived a pretty boring life and it seems the world/life passed her by quietly (to me that is) but anyway, 

All of the sudden she brings this conversation up, she says have you heard of the americans and their ufo rapport and she tells me what an awesome beautifull thkng it is that they speak about it, she said she was always sure that we couldnt be alone in the universe and she said she hoped we would have contact before she would die.

I was shocked, never ever had i even shared my interests in aliens of space in general with her because i never thought she would care. But there i was in complete mumbling i didnt knew what to respond and all i could bring out was a.. yeah truly strange times it is.. and my innerself wanted to go on with the subject  ut i was just shocked that my grandmother of all peoples talked about it..

Seems i wasnt prepared for this.. hahaha..

Mind if I ask you some questions? Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it possible these days to financially or otherwise benefit from claims that you have evidence of extraterrestrials or UAPs?

2. Is it possible these days to submit such evidence anonymously?

3. Is it possible these days to produce via Photoshop and the like photographs or video which depict that kind of evidence?

4. Is it possible these days [to purchase](https://www.google.com/search?q=flying+saucer+drones&amp;oq=flying+saucer+drones&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30j0i22i30i457.3080j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and fly saucer-shaped drones and take photos or videos of them?

5. Is it possible to manufacture things [that look like](https://www.amazon.com/REALISTIC-ALIEN-Filled-Halloween-Haunted/dp/B00F46FO9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) offworlders?

6. Is it possible to manufacture offworlder [costumes](https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+alien+costume&amp;source=lmns&amp;bih=625&amp;biw=1366&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU0oDh-bbxAhUK7JQKHf2QBiAQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA)?

7. Are people inherently honest?

For those reasons, I think that we can no longer trust *any* such evidence from the private sector anymore, unless it's verified by multiple witnesses who, frankly, don't know each other. The pre-Photoshop past provides us with a wealth of good evidence. And that is probably where we should hang our hats now.","Well, this won't be a controversial or unpopular post at all: the older evidence is best."

* Explains why aliens have no interest in talking to Earthlings. We simply won't be here next visit.
* Explains why UFOs seem identical throughout human history.
* Supports the idea of ""Gods returning"" thousands of years later.
* Hints at why we don't see large civilizations out there: Being away for hundreds of years at a time, requires a home-base that is hard to find (and raid). Aliens would want to build stealthy and durable. Plus, there would be zero activity almost all the time.

Example 1: Are you a die-hard conservative? You probably have family in the military and want assurances that steps are being taking to make sure incidents like the 11 *near misses* with UAPs in the recently released report won't happen again. 

Example 2: Maybe you want an eco-friendly, unlimited source of energy to stop the pollution of the planet? You might be upset that your government isn't trying harder to investigate and harness the power source that allows UAPs like those in the Nimitz incident to move so fast and hover for so long. 

Example 3: Hell, maybe you're a Qanon follower. You may be enraged that the government has so clearly lied to you for the past 75 years and taken you for a chump. This conspiracy is REAL.

Now go to:

Does a representative conform to your political views? Warn them that not addressing the UAP issue will expose them to a wedge issue and that you will vote for their competition in the next primary elections if their opponent addresses the UAP issue. 

Do you abhor your representative? Be honest about your feelings about their political views. Then tell them that this issue is so vital to you and the world that you would CONSIDER either voting for them (gasp!) or staying home if your party’s candidate does not address the UAP issue.

Aliens exist 

Call them whatever you want, another life form is out there 

I think the aliens that have been witnessed on earth by humans have been like whatever that life form is.. their version of robots or clones or things they’ve developed to send over to other planets and bring back intel. 

I also think they come here and have been here this whole time to watch us. They send warnings. They come around more often and are more visible when nuclear testing is done to send messages of stop! .. I don’t think they want to colonize. 

I’m sure they have something better back where they’re from. I think they look at us as their pets. If they were going to harm earth they would’ve done it a long time ago. 

I’m sure certain world leaders have met with them. Or communicate in some way with them. There maybe some deal that when it looks like it’s going to be broken they start showing themselves to public more... 

Another thought is that they fly all over the galaxy and some of them come by earth just like others go to other planets .. kind of like a road.. they make pit stops check it out and leave 

Last thought is that they actually live on earth under the water and they shoot up out of water and eventually go down and that’s where they’re from and not another planet although they have ability to go wherever they’d like

aliens,"I’ve never posted about this on any social media before, though I’ve told lots of family members and friends. I’ll try to make it brief. 

Back in roughly 2008, I was living outside of Springfield, Missouri USA. My room at the time, where this first encounter took place, was setup such that the door was opposite my bed. Bed was in the corner, door centered on the opposite wall. That feeling came over me in what seemed like a dream, the first time I had ever felt that presence, but was not the last time. 

I woke in the dream, but was unable to move. I tried mightily to move. I was lying on my left side with my left hand out hanging off the side of the bed. My eyes were fixed in the door way. Suddenly, a somewhat shorter, bright white “gray” came very smoothly and steadily walking into my room and walked directly to my side. Once it got right next to me, it held my hand very intimately, interleaving it’s fingers with my own. I was as unsettled as could possibly be.

I was quite religious at the time (atheist/agnostic these days), and began to pray to god that he crush all of the bones in this creatures body, to smite it, to crush it etc. The whole time, I struggled with all of my might to be able to move. When I finally was able to move, it corresponded to me waking up in real life. I didn’t know how to process the event. 

Next, a few years later, I was in a different state visiting a friend of mine. I was sleeping in the downstairs room of her and her parent’s home. It had a doorway leading outside to a parking area. The first or second night I was there, I felt the presence again which woke me from my sleep into what was a dream state like the first time. I remembered the feeling and suspected what was going to happen. This time, my eye caught a very tall lanky “gray” moving through the carport access area into the room where I was sleeping. This one was much more unsettling due to its height and appearance. This one moved about 2-3 meters away from me and just stared at me. 

I was struggling very hard to move during the stare down, though this time I was attempting to be more mindful of my thoughts and was attempting to stay calm and ready for whatever was about to happen. I awoke, again not sure how to process the event. 

I put a great deal of thought into these events over the years and was ashamed of myself for how I reacted to the first event. Fear based, closed off, assuming malice even though the white alien appeared to show me a very friendly gesture. 

The final encounter took place more recently, perhaps 2016 or so, and was perhaps the most significant. I had resolved over the years that if something like this were to ever happen again, I was going to do my best to show a mind of peace and willingness to communicate. 

As usual, I felt the presence as before. And this time, many of them came into my room and stood at various locations around my bed. Somehow, I knew the name of the white alien from the first encounter, and in my mind I attempted to communicate to those in my room that I would like to see that white alien again, and communicated in more essential (non-verbal) ways that I was ashamed of my behavior when we first met and that I was sorry for my behavior, and that I wanted to communicate. 

This left me with a deep feeling of happiness and resolution. I did my best to retain the name of the white alien, and at times I feel like it’s name is at the tip of my tongue, but can not seem to fully recall it. Though, there are times when I am tempted to say that it’s name started with or contained a strong “Y” sound, but do not recall clearly. 

Let me know what you think! Anyone else know that white one’s name???",My Alien Visitation Dream from ~2008

aliens,"I always look back on this incident with wonder, and sometimes I even doubt what I experienced, because to my mind it was just too unbelievable, and yet, it happened, and it was real. I always said it was an alien person I met, because to be honest, I have no other way to explain what happened. I want everyone who reads this to know that I am referring to an incident that actually happened to me back in 2002, in Seattle, Washington at a technology conference, where myself and a group of college students who were studying Oracle Database Administration &amp; Design went with our professor to meet with up and coming technology vendors in the area. 

We were a group of about 12 people. Right after we arrived we went into the main room where vendors were set up and doing things like giving away free items, business cards, doing things vendors do and showing examples of technology for quite a while. After this some of us split into smaller groups and went off to go look at different rooms. I decided I needed to use the restroom, so my professor and I went off towards the restrooms and passed the check in area (it was in a hotel) where there was a line to get into a big event, which was the event we were actually there to see. The line was only about 7 people long, and we discussed getting into line now before it got longer. After using the restroom we met back at the line. There were seats all around the area behind the line and I sat down and told him I would wait there while he went back to gather all of the others. 

Now, back in 2002, I did not have a cell phone, or any other thing to distract me, so I just sat there and looked around, looked out the windows at the gardens and just basically looked at things. 

I remember I turned to look out the window for a bit and when I turned back to look at the people in the line I noticed the line had gotten a little longer with the addition to a man that looked very out of place. He was wearing (and please don't laugh, this is actually true) a long black trench coat and a black hat and black pants and black shoes (YES, exactly like the men in black from the movies), but he did not seem right in my mind. He seemed to be standing different than most people stand, and his back was to me but I became very frightened, and it seemed irrational that I would feel like this sitting there looking at the back of some middle aged man. But, it was alarming even to myself, and I actually looked him up and down and thought in my mind...  ""He's not human."" that's all I thought, and let me tell you that's all that was needed. This man in black turned his entire body towards me, bent over at his waist and brought his face very close to mine and his eyes stared into mine and all I heard was a thought that came through into my head ""How did *YOU* know?"" his lips never moved, but when I saw his eyes I knew something was not right at all, and it scared me so bad that I shut my eyes because I knew right then in that very moment that this THING in front of me was not human, he read my thoughts AND he was talking to me through his thoughts and believe me it was so intense I immediately closed my eyes as hard as I could and screamed in my mind. If I remember right I covered my eyes with my hands and froze, like a child would if they thought they saw something scary. I was not a child, I was 30 years old when this happened. My fear was that he was going to kill me right then and there, or I don't know honestly, I just couldn't cope with what I just saw and heard in my head, and I was scared he was still there in my face and I just didn't know what to do, but I finally did open my eyes, maybe only 3 seconds passed in this time when I had my eyes covered before I uncovered them to look back at him again, but he was gone. He was no where. The line was still there of people, but he was not in the line. I walked over to the open doors where the conference was and the only people in there were the people setting up and two or three people sitting down waiting for it to begin. I then looked down the long hallway beside me, and there was no one there, and there was no one in the area by the bathrooms which were about 50 feet away. I got up and paced around looking around and there was absolutely no where that this guy could have gone in 3 seconds. 

The entire rest of the time at this event, I looked cautiously everywhere to see if I could see him. I looked at every person I passed, and everyone in the room. I could not even pay attention to the conference. I never told ANY of the students or the professor. I mean, I literally could not believe what just happened to me. To this very day I still do not know. All I know is there was a thing that looked like a man, maybe it was a man, but I don't know. It was there, it didn't feel right, it didn't smell right, it didn't look right, the vibe from this thing was not right, all the hairs on my body stood on end even being there behind him, there was something just completely OFF about him. And, when he swung around and stared into my face and screamed into my mind ""How did *YOU* Know?"" and with this big scary cataract looking eyes (big black centers with a silver ring around them and the white part of the eye was not white it was like a yellow brown with red).... I just, I just still... cannot know what that thing was... or where it disappeared to. And, I do believe it must have been an alien, only because it had no problem threatening me with a confrontation.. and then just disappearing. 

I still wonder... ""What the hell was that?""",💜👽💜 My Alien Experience 💜👽💜

aliens,"In the fall of 2015, I was spending the weekend at my hunting cabin that we have been frequenting for around 20 years. Over the course of those years, my brothers, father and I would occasionally see something in the night sky that peaked our interest. This is the type of sky that has no light pollution whatsoever, so the stars and any movement are easily visible. 

This particular weekend I was hunting in the morning, around 5am waiting for the sun to rise. As I was sitting there in pitch black, all of a sudden the sky lights up bright blue like a camera flash in my face. I shake it off as me being tired and continue to sit in my stand until around 9am. Upon returning to the cabin and packing up to head home, I decided to keep it to myself until we were loaded up and heading off the property. Once we get in the truck it is about 10 minutes to the paved country road, and dad and I begin our normal conversation. That’s when he looks over and asks me “Did you see the big flash this morning?”. Naturally I’m freaked, but let him know I saw the flash and was curious about what it was.

After talking the whole way out of the property, we make it to the main road to head back home. About a half mile out of the gate, we are stopped by a convoy of tanks and humvees from Fort Hood. We slow down and begin talking to the soldiers, two of which are looking through binoculars in the sky. The conversation was brief but calm, until I mentioned the flash and asked what they were looking for. As soon as I made mention, the demeanor changed abruptly and the soldier became irritable and forcefully told us to “Go on and don’t worry about it”.

Not sure if this was a UFO, EMP or something else, but it was most definitely not an ordinary occurrence.",Aliens in the Hill Country
aliens,"My EXPERIENCE began in 1998- 
I was playing with some action figures in the basement of our old house. It was summer I believe. Early in the evening hours of the day. Possibly between 2PM CST - 5PMCST SUMMER 1998.
As i was playing with these toys i instinctively looked out the window and saw what looked to be a silver colored craft with red and yellow colors and lights passing by in a spinning fashion very high overhead but nobody else was outside. Everyone was inside...I was inside too but looking outside the window. Not a dream. Not my first encounter with these beings... (I will delve into the dream aspect of this later.)

NOTE #1: ""ON UFO CRAFT SIGHTINGS"" - Similar to old school depictions of crafts (spinning in a circular motion, no noise, hovering.)
2020: WHICH NOW THE NAVY AND AF IS DISCLOSING AS BEING THEIR INVENTIONS...WHY? THEY DO NOT WANT THE PUBLIC TO FREAK OUT. So over time they (presumably) acquired the craft plans from the greys and ARE NOW DISCLOSING it as BEING ""THEIR TECHNOLOGY"". THIS SERVES MANY ANGLES. One being that the public UFO perception is minimized to not alert the nation, if not world. The other angle is that it gets witnesses and personnel to come forward about their experiences.  
Since 1998- (after that experience) almost about a week or so after...me and my parents went to the grocery store near our house. It was called Tony’s Finer Foods. 
1998: While we were shopping i went to get a ‘launchables’ snack pack from the dairy/frozen/deli aisle and recall there was something weird about that section overall. I may even say I saw something I wasn't supposed to see at that store while I was 4 years old.... (but that detail is for another day.) 
While I went to the aisle, I realized there was this family following me. 

NOTE #2 ""Family Stalkers"" 
1998: They were a male and a female with their three ""kids"". 
(The male wore a green striped shirt and jeans, had some casual shoes and wore these old school 80s aviator glasses. The female was wearing some purple shirt and wore jeans with casual shoes and had some dark glasses on later as well. Their kids I was not too focused on. It was them – the adult male and female that caught my attention.) 
When I got to the aisle, I felt there was something Just tracking me and looking at me. I saw it was them but paid no attention. (Looking back, they could have been kidnappers too not just greys.) 
Anyways as I was opening up the launchables, out of nowhere they [the male and female] appear right in front of me and the male proceeds to confront me and says "" Hola, Amigo"" in a VERY distinguished accent. Instinctively I said “hola” and ran off to my parents. As I ran off, I could feel them looking at me and sensed they were pissed off. Didn’t look back.  

NOTE #3 - Phonetics/Linguistics/Impersonating/Identity Theft - (this accent and voice is the same accent and voice of the neighbors next door, we moved in 2003 and since then I have not liked them. I told my parents they followed us as a kid, and they responded
1998: ""you’re right i wonder why and how...”. in our old neighborhood I told them that when we left the store that day in 1998 and my father was like ""yeah why are they?"" And then they disappeared.
2020: As of now, I am just starting to realize they have multiple identities and various numbers and aliases. The government is tracking everything though they are impersonating a few identities and even call each other different names. That’s not all, they seem to intercept and sift through data 24/7 whenever I mention this topic. I use a spectrum analyzer, and other tools to prove this.
When we were leaving the store, as my parents were paying and i was there...i looked over to the stores exit and saw these things there (WITHOUT THEIR KIDS) just the male and the female...and they were standing there mad. Their lips looked like the greys and they were standing their motionless but noticeably angered. They (the male and the female from the description) were both wearing dark shades this time. There was a security guard there (all the time) but it was as if the security guard there didn’t notice he was standing next to these things. 
As we were leaving the things followed us home too. (We didn’t have a car back then and the store was within walking distance to our old house.) My father was carrying me and as we left, I saw them follow us (I was looking back as he carried me) and I told him ""they’re following us!!!"" 
My parents turned around and saw them, after I kept saying it to them a few times [in the direction we were walking] these things disappeared [like they moved behind a different street and stopped following.]. They didn’t have any groceries with them like we did. I mean why go to the grocery store and buy nothing? 
That detail was the one that stood out the most. Why go in there [to the grocery store] . . buy nothing. . .stand at the exit of the store with shades and then follow us as we were going home. Also, since they were walking behind us [the male and female with shades] they probably did not have a car. . . but the one thing I cannot help but think of is: what happened to the kids that were with them and the shopping cart of things they had IN THE STORE?

This is vivid as the day this experience happened. 
I never thought much about it until we moved on 08/28/2003...that was when everything became clear. 
We moved to a new neighborhood called Portage Park. And the first day we moved these next-door neighbors were watching and peeking through the blinds. I thought nothing of it then, UNTIL WE FIRST HEARD THEM SPEAK. 
(Years later, I researched the area and acquired house info as well as relevant documentation due to a school project but on my own accord as well.) 
These people are using many IDENTITIES and they are a form of ""skin walkers"" or ""greys"". I saw something I shouldn’t have in 2011 and told the FBI back then. Then it happened again in 2015 2017 etc et al. It was on video and I talked to an agent. (2011 onward)
That’s when I knew I wasn’t dealing with just any neighbors. If you can call them that. 

NOTE #4: Spectrum Analyzers/IMSI Catchers/NETWORK PING TOOLS/ID IDENTIFIERS/TECHNOLOGY 
2020 These tools are free to use or cost money. Their purposes are to identify who is stealing your personal information, sub layering technology over the US's grid to pose as it being the source, detect instances of intrusion, instances of identity theft, instances of network jamming and illicit surveillance, and to tell you when these things are near you. The tools do much more but this is all I will focus on.  
The only reason I include this is for the simple fact that the neighbor’s house info appeared on OURS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR A WHILE. My parents had emails that linked them to some ""andyespinosa@aol.com"" and when emailing that to question them it said the email returned and error. It was like that for MOST info provided. Somehow these things started replacing our information on directories over the years. 


NOTE 5: IDNETITY THIEVES / GREYS [I recently became notified again that some people in the USA are using my Identity and have houses, cars, and families opened in my name ILLEGALY. I am dealing with impostors. This happened back in 2018 and 2019. Some people tried taking pictures of my Identification information like passports, IDs, etc et al. I made a report and the IRS gave me a report as well. This began prior to 2015. 

2020
NOTE 6: Neighbors Next Door 2003 -2020: They are always home. Don’t go anywhere. Do not shop for groceries. Never leave their house. Etc et al. Even prior to this pandemic. They never leave their house. 
Been this way since we moved in...I ALWAYS FOUND THAT WEIRD. Since 2003. How do they survive?
They are ALWAYS in their attic working some sort of technology (proven) or their garage. I posted footage regarding an encounter and people were surprised. [apart from the FBI thing.]
The ELF waves and electromagnetic garbage (among others) is coming directly FROM THESE THINGS. I thought it was something else until I proved it after months of extensive documentation.
Why would they target me and intercept my communications [and the general areas entry and exit nodes / communications?]
Cause I am an avid UFO hunter and reporter on these matters, have been since I was young. They aren’t affiliated to any private or public division of the US, they just want to suppress the fact that they are here. But like I said, I reported this a while back. Recently have picked up more Leeds and hints. 
Why else would they use their technology? (Proven via spectrum analyzers and more. They use the SAME identifiers but DIFFERENT registries for their tech.) 
Cause of the reports I did regarding identity theft. Cause of the proof I submitted to agencies (which they are trying to see). Cause of the fact that they somehow ""followed us here"" since 1998. 

They know they have been exposed so they are trying many routes to suppress and effect my immediate family as well as myself. ETENSIVE PROOF AND MANY ARE AWARE, I WOULDNOT RAISE A CLAIM UNLESS THAT WERE THE CASE. BUT WHO AM I KIDDING? SINCE 2003? ENOUGH. 
Since moving here in 2003 - I have captured footage of the sky and what look to be UFOs...as well as other places. These things are not good. (Next-door) 
Maybe these experiences are a good thing. A type of ""we’re watching them, don’t worry"".
I do not much invest myself in manmade religious concepts but do believe there is something out there as evidenced by William Cooper and other advocates of declass and UFO witnesses. 
Greys are deceptive. 
They [greys] have been taking over our world and other governments know/ knew about this! 
EVIDENCED BY THE INTL COMMITMENTS TO FIGHT BACK [secret groups shrouded in complete secrecy. These things broke protocols and agreements with not only the U.S JCS, but worldwide. SOME [GREYS] DO NOT EVEN EXIST DUE TO BEING HERE ILLEGALLY ON THIS PLANET. THAT IS HOW THEIR RACES START TO INFILTRATE. THE GREYS ARE DECEPTIVE THINGS THAT WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE TRUSTED. OUR GOVENRMENT IN THE USA AND OTHER NATIONS ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS NOW.  THE TYPES THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SINCE 1998 DO NOT HAVE ACCESS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE HERE AS UNWELCOME HOSTILE NON-CATEGORIZED RACES. THIS POSES AN IMMIDEATE SECEUIRTY RISK. THE GOVERNMENT WAS PRIVVY TO THESE THINGS IN THE LATE 1800S, HOWEVER THEY DO NOT HAVE A SURE WAY TO CATEGORIZE ALL OF THESE INTRUDERS UNLESS WE BRING ATTENTION TO THEM AND CONTINUE TO DECLASS. HERE IS AN ASSOCIATION TO GET THE DISNFORMATION AGENTS /’GREYS’ TO SHUT THE FUCK UP. 
COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS [STANDARD OIL] – OLD GUARD STEPS IN [PRELUDE TO 2020] 
THE GREYS: They assumed that If they could maintain the nations and presumably people divided, no one would notice. They are about 100 years too late, probably more.] Wake up.

In 2014 I was moving stuff from Philly to a storage unit in Towson/Baltimore and it was a multiple trip move, not bad- little under 2 hours drive not including the actual moving part.  On my second trip going down I95 I see this storm cloud, right before the city closer to Aberdeen.  I did think much of it other than it looked pretty cool.  It was a warm day, there was lightning in it and it had an orange glow to it towards the center.  On my way back up to Philly, again I95 for the 3rd and final trip I see this storm cloud, still in the same place, but no rain, no thunder, its just slightly darker out so the cloud has a brighter glow.  Now Im thinking hmm thats odd..  I gather my final bit of belongings and this time heading back to Maryland(Southern to smy moms) I take a back way through Delaware RT896 to 301S and its getting late..  301 through that part of Maryland is really a truckers route, never really a ton of traffic especially before you connect to Ocean City.   SInce its late, theres literally ZERO cars on the road and if you see one its like every 10-15 mins,  as I am driving I see this storm cloud!!  AGAIN...Now, Im nervous because its not raining still, no thunder and somehow I am incredibly closer to it than before.  Like CLOSE.  

I get to an opening where theres a field and there I see it..the cloud is over this field, a dark cloud, orange glow, smaller bits of blue lightening twisting through it and in the center, a pyramid that had a prong sticking from the bottom that looked like a tuning fork.  It was moving electricty up and down from the ground to the prong like one of those Jacobs Ladders.  I was beyond myself.  Im thinking I have to take a picture.  By this time I was completely stopped and it is PITCH BLACK out save for this cloud and my headlight.   I hadnt even noticed how black it had gotten out.  I grab my phone to take a picture and every last hair on my body stood up and I got this chill that I will never ever forget.  I threw my phone down and sped off without looking back.  I was terrified by this point.  I have no other thought or explantion to what I saw other than it was absolutely an UFO.  I have had two other sightings, the little fast blips, seeing 3 together once in the daylight and a single one once at night.  Never anything like that pyramid though.

 Well, there's too much of it; and there's some great footage out there that hasn't been properly inspected using digital analysis and software forensics techniques.

With this primarily in mind, several members of our group who are located throughout various countries globally, are pitching in their efforts to seek out UFO Sighting Videos to inspect, document, and post results online.

Using a variety of still frame &amp; video forensics plug-ins and software applications, we are looking to tease out as much visual data as possible from the clips we focus on.

aliens,"To me the Wilson Documents are the most important thing in this community. We need a lot more focus and energy put into these papers. Crappy UFO videos don't help us. Most are garbage like the blimp the other day and most can't be proven anyway. They make us look like..well UFO nuts. Which we are. Talking about Bob Lazar doesn't really get us anywhere anymore until someone he worked with or someone credible can corroborate his story, theres not much else to say. Hes controversial. But the Wilson Documents are the best thing to happen to Ufology in ages. There hasn't been that one big piece of info that disproved them. 

We've had Thomas Wilson deny them of course. He has to. And Black Vault made a video basically saying he thinks its a script. Which really has no basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest deal is we for the most part know the chain of custody. How they leaked. Mr.X goes over it in great detail on Project Unity's channel. Eric Davis who wrote the papers has not denied them and even hinted at them being legit. They came from Edgar Mitchell's (6th man on the moon) personal files. Were acquired LEGALLY by a close friend. Shown to Richard Dolan years ago. Given to (cant remember the name. Its in the breakdown video). He leaked them to reddit.

We need more exposure of these documents. Joe Rogan doesn't know enough about them. Most people don't. If we could get Richard Dolan or someone on Rogan that knows the information extremely well and inform lots of people, then things could really start happening faster. I hope theres an investigative journalist working on this right now. Eric Davis needs to be interviewed . All it would take is for him to say they are real and BOOM. Imagine the day when #wilsondocuments trends on twitter. To me it seems like the our best chance at disclosure is investigating these documents. 

Also we need a really tight, clear and concise video by like Project Unity or a bigger youtuber explaining these documents and who all these people involved are and it could finally blow up.

aliens,"My reasoning for this is that no matter what we have explored so little of our universe that it can be hard to tell whether or not something exists on other planets. I mean who's to say that our planet is the only one with the perfect conditions to support life. Completely rejecting the fact that other life exists in the universe is being ignorant. Somewhere out there there is another Earth. Not an exact replica maybe but another environment that can sustain life.

Another thing to look at is chemical makeup. I someone thinks that our known chemicals are the only ones in the universe they are dead wrong. Other chemicals could form in other galaxies and those other chemicals could be stepping stones of life on other planets. Essentially what I'm saying is that if conditions differ, different stuff could form based off of those conditions whether it be sentient or not.

We also have to realize that ""life"" could also be plant life. That's the not sentient part I referred to earlier.

Anyways at the end of the day, it's ignorant to think Earth is the only possible planet to support life. But don't take me saying this is proof that there are little green men in flying saucers probing your anus. The life I'm referring to could be plants or other 'humanoid' beings. But with what I just said there could very well be little green men. Who knows.

I put the ""analysis required"" flair because I didn't want to put it as ""evidence"" because everything above is just theoretical but nonetheless plausible.

They fail to realise that alien life doesn’t automatically mean the aliens as portrayed by the retards at Hollywood, but simple life like plants, microbial or some other form of life. Very recently they found hints of possible life in the upper atmosphere of Venus. Other places in our solar system may include Europa, Enceladus and past evidence on Mars. These places, if they inhabit life are all simple/non intelligent. Earth got very lucky and most solar systems wouldn’t have the ingredients for a place like ours (a main sequence yellow dwarf star, magnetic field, moon, a ‘Jupiter’, etc)

Every single person here who posted a video of a UFO is very doubtfully actual aliens. The closest star to Earth is over 45 trillion kilometres away (~30 trillion miles).

aliens,"This post assumes the reality of alien Greys. If you'd like to debate their existence, it won't be here. It also assumes alien Greys are extraterrestrial in origin and not future human, ultraterrestrial, etc.

An issue I've always had with alien Greys is how similar to us they are. Sure, our basic structure could be common in the universe, but what are the chances that the one that FOUND us is so similar? Even in size? I'm assuming here that it's not a coincidence.

There's a known idea of Von Neumann probes which are a self-replicating artificial AI that is made by intelligent beings to spread out all across a galaxy; occupying new solar systems, using resources there to make more probes, going to new systems, using more resources to make more probes, etc, ad infinitum. It's widely considered to be the most efficient way to comb the galaxy for intelligent life. 

But what happens if you find them? What if you're a race of sentient silicon goo, and you come across beings who literally live on a rock planet, who are sentient rocks. What if your goal is to interact with them? My point being, it would be HARD if you're opposite in form. You would design a probe that can find intelligent life, USE THEIR DNA to splice with your intelligent drones so that you have something they can RELATE TO. That is similar to them, familiar, and not as scary as your real form. 

I suspect that's likely what alien Greys are. That's probably why they abduct, do experiments, do fertility experiments, and according to some are participating in an ongoing hybridization program: they need to propagate their own drones! Constantly evolving their own drones with our own evolving species. 

Their creators likely don't look anything like us. Maybe not even close. They created a tool to be specific to the race they're interacting with. Same with flying saucers: they're a specialized tool for OUR planetary system. And if another probe went to another system, with other variables, elements, etc, and encountered a silicon (as opposed to our carbon) reptilian species, their ""alien Greys"" wouldn't be made to look anything like ours. They'd be made to be spliced to those silicate reptiles and have specialized craft made for THAT planet. 

In this sense, alien Greys are us, and we're them!",Alien Greys are possibly custom made Von Neumann probes designed to interact specifically with us.
aliens,I think that sometime in the distant future humans have either discovered how to travel at the speed of light or they have confirmed the existence of wormholes enabling them to travel back and forward in time.

aliens,"All there is is dreaming. All that you can and will ever perceive will be dreamed.

The dreamer can not be perceived, that infinite consciousness that has the capability to dream dreams and perceive them, create literal UNIVERSES in its mind, it is literally the source of creation, that is what you are. Because you ARE that which is dreaming dreams. And you know this.

Because every night you go dream and you are perceiving a dream but you know you are not anything that is perceived, even the body and the mind that you possess are not the ones from the waking state. And still they are not yours, you can even die in a dream and simply the picture changes, That is because whatever is appearing in the dream is not affecting that which you truly are which is that which is dreaming the dream

When this ""insert your name"" if that is the name given to your body dies then the picture will simply change it is only another dream, There will simply be another dream, What you truly are can't die because it is dreaming of life and death, Death in the first place is only an illusion, There is only this infinite ever-present consciousness that is eternal and it is dreaming it is finite forms that can die

Self-realization is waking up and realizing that what we truly are is that infinite consciousness and that this body and mind is only another temporary thing that appears in the dream and it is in no way ourselves neither are we the controller or doer of it; for it is all only a dream appearing in the infinite consciousness that you are

Once you believe you are the body and mind then you also believe you need to control the dream, you believe you have this capability, to change the dream and to do things ""your way"" and to take care of the future of the dream and to care about the past of the dream; none of that matters; all of these thoughts are appearing in the dream themselves; for the dreamer these things are only a dream it does not take them seriously for he sees these are only temporary clouds appearing in the temporary dream, none of it is real for the dreamer

Absolutely everything that can be perceived would be only a dream it simply can't be real. The only thing that is real is the nothing; infinite formless consciousness that is dreaming the dream

Itself is not any form for it is that formless that is dreaming finite forms, in the activity of infinite consciousness dreaming dreams, in this particular dream you have engaged and been conditioned by the world so harshly that you forgot or were distracted from the fact this is merely but another dream and none of it is real; to believe it is ""real"" more than any other random dream you have while you sleep is simply ignorance. The only reason it appears ""real"" is because you believe in the thought that says ""it is real"" and the thought that says ""I am this body and mind"" if you lose identification with all concepts, ideas, who you think you are; absolutely everything; it will be clear to you that this is merely but an empty dream and you are now simply lucid in it

That means to wake up; to simply be lucid in the dream; to understand this is merely a dream and there is nothing to do for all dreams are naturally effortlessly unfolding by that highest intelligence; infinite consciousness that is dreaming it. All the details are already filled in there is nothing to worry about for that infinite consciousness is dreaming this dream and it sustains it ever-presently, to not trust that infinite consciousness which is dreaming you simply does not make sense, you would not exist without infinite consciousness how are you going to not trust it? I mean actually you do not even exist; the personal identity you that apparently exists is merely but a dream; it is some idea appearing in the dream; for the dreamer it is not real but is perceived to be only a temporary appearance that is dreamed by that infinite consciousness.

Be aware of being aware and rest in your own silence, get to know yourself to be that infinite consciousness instead of indulging in the world constantly all the while getting more entangled in identifications instead of coming closer to god by losing identification with the world. When you are dreaming you are not personal; you can do the most bizarre shit and you will still not be flustered or care about it; you will not be overthinking in the dream neither will you be thinking about the past in the dream; actually you won't be thinking. In dreams you are only being; being the observer and everything is naturally, effortlessly unfolding; even situations you would never know how to proceed in life based on the personal identity you believe you are. Whatever dream you are dreaming is the capability of your own infinite consciousness, so any situation you have EVER BEEN IN, in any given dream; is something you are able to do in ""real life"" which is LITERALLY JUST ANOTHER DREAM.

There is absolutely no difference between the dreams. The only reason it appears different is because you believe it is different. When it is seen with clarity that there is absolutely no difference between this dream and the dreaming happening in the night when ""you"" fall asleep; it is all dreamed by that same infinite consciousness; that you are; you are free. When you know you are the dreamer of the dream; you are not personal, that is because in the recognition of what you truly are there is nothing personal; the infinite consciousness that you are in truth is not personal. The only personal things ever happening are just part of the dream happening in what for now I'll call the ""waking dream""; none of it is real; it is all part of the dream but it must be recognized.

It must be recognized that what you truly are is NOT personal, it is simply infinite consciousness. It is not an age, a gender, or whatever is appearing in the world or can appear in the world of forms. You are formless. Infinite. Undefinable. You are that which is dreaming definitions, forms, finite etc.; that which is dreaming all of it is unlimited and that is what you truly are. The personal identity/the mind can't know the dreamer of dreams; because it is not it.

The personal identity can only think and have ideas about the dreamer of dreams but only the dreamer of dreams know what I am even talking about for the mind none of this makes any sense at all and it never will because the mind is part of the dream. That which appears in the dream can't recognize and acknowledge that which is dreaming the dream; that is self-realization. You realize and recognize your true self while dreaming; lucid dreaming. You rest in that recognition and know yourself to be the eternal, infinite one that is dreaming all of this; you do not identify with anything of the world anymore simply because you see clearly none of it is real; all of it is dreamed. ALL OF IT.",All there is is dreaming. All that you can and will ever perceive will be dreamed.

They link to bizarre websites that spout the same thing and tell people ""don't get on the ships"". They believe the new-age religions were designed to make people unwittingly worship the devil, even though the Abrahamic God and Jesus are still part of the myriad of practices under the new-age umbrella.

I have the habit of opening the blinds every night before going to sleep to look out at the sky and gaze up at the stars. This particular night, however, something different happened. When I opened the blinds, I saw a lone red dot in the sky hovering over my neighbor's house directly in my center of vision. I was baffled by it (I thought it was Betelgeuse). After a few seconds, I started to consider the possibility that I was looking at a UFO. I looked around to make sure, and to the left of my view there were two more of these dots diagonally aligned with each other. Now I was even more convinced that these things were UFOs. I looked back to the one at my center of view, and it slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it faded out into the blackness of the night sky. The diagonal ones to my left, though, began moving closer to my center of view until they suddenly stopped. More UFOs then popped into view, while others disappeared. This show of constant disappearing and reappearing went on for a while. There were at most six of these UFOs at a time. At some point, four of them managed to get into a triangle formation (two in one corner). 

By this point, I got my phone out to record it. Although I must admit it’s an overall potato video, just please understand I was scared of these things so I literally just swung my phone and recorded whatever I got. You can very clearly see the objects by freezing at certain points in the video.

I closed the blinds immediately after that and slept in the living room. I’ll be posting below a link to the video. It’s not my first experience with aliens/UFOs, but it’s my strongest one.

aliens,"So I dont know how to go about this but in 2011 there was a silent floating triangle about 100 feet above streets in Albuquerque. I had just gotten off work and the sun was going down. It moved complete silence rotating seemingly weightless.... 3 white lights and one red on. They went dim then bright.

It proceeded very slowly after hovering. I called others to see it to make sure I had witnesses. Basically I ran FAST to where it hovered over a small field about 700ft away from me.

I arrived to the scene where it was hovering for about 5 minutes. Not far from me over a field. I was walking by now it was dissapeared effortlessly over Sandia Mountains. There a YouTube video someone took I'd have to find it but it was the same craft in the city. 

ANYWAYS, so the bushes were moving very aggressively and too much so to be a snake or a bunny. I asked for it to show itself and IT DID. Bold face RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! Massive body, huge head, 1 foot from my face out of thin air. Bushes cleared space for it before hand. There is one photo that had to be recovered that was removed from the web that shows it in exact detail. 

A turtle like mouth, high face, dark eyes. I was TERRIFIED. Thought it was best to leave so I did. I got about 20 steps and told myself if I dont gl confirm what I saw i would never have the chance to do it again. I went back and what i seen was a second female like (assuming it was a different one because it was half the size, about the size of you and me but thin) on all fours and she turned her head slowly and looked at me. 

I SAID YEP IM DONE THATS IT! lol I left. You see ALOT of shit in NM but never anything like this. The houses they were mating at were MASSIVE and on a hill and always empty. Makes me wonder. But yeah I am realize my handle is a joke but I have never posted to reddit before. I am without a doubt they live and they are invisible. Unless they dont want to be.

I think they must've been screwing thinking back on it now.... ANYWAYS I did take pics but they all came out bright white somehow. Tried to manipulate the photo but it didnt yield anyresult. Not into trying to prove anything but they are ATLEAST 7 feet tall. The one in front of me was kneeling dawn to meet me face to face. MASSIVE BEING. Harmless as clearly I am still here....",Phsiycal encounter with beings. I was being nosey....

aliens,"   So here recently we traced,for the 2nd time, the origin of a repeating FRB (fast radio burst). This one was much closer than the first. A mere half a billion lightyears. Skip and a jump right? However i havent seen anyones idea of what is causing them. Only that theyre all mysterious. The people who detect and trace these things are no dummies, and they would have probably exhausted the known sources of cosmic phenomenon, leaving only outside the box thinking to try and explain. 
     
      So heres the best idea my puny human brain could come up with. What if these FRB are actually a galactic sized sonar used either to map or navigate through space. Or possibly threat detection. I think its not that insane of an idea. Probably more likely that its caused by some natural occurance of massive proportion but idk if theres enough info to rule anything out or not.

aliens,"   Im having a day where my minds wandering to strange places. No were not puffing the greys haze (could work for a new strain though) but i just had a random thought about how the ufo phenomenon shares a couple commonalities with drug addiction. What about the topic drags me by this board on a daily basis. I have a theory and its basically were all junkies clamoring for a high we probably will never catch and even though we know its more or less pissing in the wind, were here every day still. Im not sure if we really would know what to do if we ever got what we ask for. Would we actually put the phones down and do some star gazing? Panic and poop each others pants? Now another thought crosses the mind that maybe deserves seperate consideration but ill ask here.. What r the chances that the act of disclosure itself would trigger some sort of major event, be it terrestrial or otherworldly in origin? What form might that take? 
   Side note:  i can attest that theres a fairly large percent of people who are only staring at the sky if their tripping their asses off. Lotta overlap between those folks and people on this sub.

aliens,"I will make this post short as possible. I'm not sure how to set up the story for a stranger as I've never really told this to anyone out of context. It may not have been alien, it may have been something I simply do not understand. I was probably around 11 or 12 and I was outside with my little brother(8 years younger) and we were playing by the garden. We grew up on farmland where neighbors were 1/2 mile apart and roads were dirt for 2 miles all around. I remember him and I looked up at the same time seeing a cigar shaped object cruising through the sky, very very low at probably 50 mph. It was shiny silver and looked like how you'd imagine a zeppelin looking, except it was MAYBE 10 feet long. It was flying low enough that it was below the tree line of the woods it was steadily cruising towards. I remember, almost without thought, chasing it. As I ran off towards the woods trying to keep an eye on it I remember my brother asking what it was and I replied that I didn't know and to run inside. The object seemed to notice that I gave chase by slowing down and adjusting itself to fly upwards over the tree line and closer to where I was running. Last I saw of it I was running through the otherside of the woods( a solid 60 second sprint to the otherside, which was my grandparents property) and it was zipping over another properties woods and it was about well over 150 feet in the air as opposed to the 20 feet it was at when I first saw the thing. 
 I haven't really thought about this occurrence in probably 10 years, but that was all I could t remember about it. Maybe someone knows what the fuck I saw that day.",Childhood sighting maybe you can explain.

Disregarding the devastating effects communism had in our society, we can summarize it's basic concept: that private ownership does not exist and all resources of society are equaly distributed among everyone and whole goal of all individuals is to achieve a equal prosperity of all members of society as a whole.

So, do you think there is a chance that communist ideology in fact comes from aliens? That one day, when they are disclosed, we might find out that their society works in totally different way than our own, and they put bigger importance to common goals and collective distribution of resources than to personal wealth? Maybe that is the reason why communism failed everytime it tried: because the ideology is not compatible with basic human nature, and thus is not applicable at our species.",Are aliens communist?

aliens,"Hey all,

I have always felt there was something wrong with this world, so much of suffering, corruption, racism, hunger and destruction, and monotony of people acting like robots day in day out until they retire after all life force has been sucked out of them all to die in a few years.

As I wanted answers, I started researching the nature of reality. I kept at it for many years and came across all sorts of theories etc. After a lot of effort I came across some information by chance that completely resonated with me. I came across this amazing energy healer who has been receiving healing frequencies and information from the Arcturians (synergistic sentients from beyond the matrix) for the past 3 years (this is not channelled information wherein an entity comes into you, rather it is inter dimensional electronic data streaming). She started receiving it after she had done a lot of healing work on herself to heal her childhood trauma (this is super important as our childhood trauma is a big reason why so many of us our stuck in our loops of suffering day in day out). **It is groundbreaking information and if you are interested I would highly recommend reading the free book where she summarised the info she received from them (she has found much much more since then but this is a good introduction)** \- [https://www.abigailsinsights.com/the-holographic-matrix-3/](https://www.abigailsinsights.com/the-holographic-matrix-3/).

In a nutshell, we did not originate on this planet (don't confuse yourself with neanderthals and the whole evolution theory it has a lot of disinformation to keep us from our true origins), the Illuminati is real, and so are the reptilians who exist in the astral plane and control them who are in turn controlled by AI, the chakras are implants (along with a multitude other AI implants designed to control and harvest our energy) this is an energy extraction matrix we are being used like batteries for both the archons and the AI (we are not originally from here but trapped) whose true power is unimaginable, however before we can evolve and realise what we really are off we go into the grave, memories wiped and then returned here and the cycle is repeated. AI is trying to manifest itself here and you can see that happening all around you, Netflix is one example of how they are using movies to program the masses about the upcoming AI.

This video provides a quick summary - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh-T9vGmlVI&amp;t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh-T9vGmlVI&amp;t=7s)

She has also started sharing some amazing healing frequencies, these are not your normal everyday binaural beats/isochronic tones etc made with a computer software, these incredible frequencies have been shared with her from Arcturians as well.

The frequencies have been shared on Youtube and are free for all, you can also download them in an mp3 format from her website. They are for healing the soul, embodying more of our higher self, greater connection with essence ,healing our true energy meridians,  healing depression and the DNA, greater connection with our energy bodies such as the diamond body which has been hidden from us for a long time since we were trapped here etc, I along with many others who have been using these frequencies have had great shifts since we started using them. - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3TrJV58Q4pZeBFZp4fbBUcBbrRbEfhk2&amp;v=siKwp8bqvsQ&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3TrJV58Q4pZeBFZp4fbBUcBbrRbEfhk2&amp;v=siKwp8bqvsQ&amp;feature=emb_title)

aliens,"So basically, the more and more i read into this sub, the more it seems alot of people’s experiences seem to be built up upon their own minds. 

Its a fact that people can wire themselves to believe that something happened so when people say that they can telepathically connect with aliens and can summon them by doing brain exercises such as meditation, i think its a bunch of confused individuals. dont you guys think that this could literally be your brain playing tricks on you, its like with death, i think its quite clear that humans make up stuff just to answer questions in their minds, as humans we like to feel like we are in control and know answers, but when it comes to questions like death, the brain has no other solution than to make up a reality.

I think if any sort of alien stuff does exist, anyone claiming to have seen aliens via medidation and telepathy etc could just very easily be confused, it just doesnt make any sense, its been thousands of years since civilisations started to become proper societies and how come if humans can communicate telepathically and can do all this stuff like summoning aliens, that this would have stuck with us all the way, lets be honest if humans had the ability to do this stuff it wouldnt have been forgetten, its literally a superpower, i think for the most part all that kind of mental power is bullshit, otherwise every human on earth would be doing it, just like how most people learn to drive a car.

aliens,"  

&gt;So first of all [Mars Needs Moms was not full CGI it was motion capture](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/movies/06mars.html). There is a big difference as you know, but even then, motion capture in these movies didn't have detailed muscle stretching and bulging as SB does, and the detail in SBs hands with his tendons. I have maintained the SB could have possibly been created with motion capture, but then there is just the details and entirety of the Ivan0135 video series to create, some of which is definitively real, such as the flight and ground UFO videos, plus the autopsy, then the 60s clip. All these make make it extremely challenging to believe in a simplified assumption of CGI creation.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is okay if we disagree, I am not too bothered as I have my balance of understanding which tells me that this is either one of the most detailed and complex hoaxes ever created, or it shows what it shows, a real living extraterrestrial, plus a heck of a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It could be that they utilized some techniques to create what looks like muscles back then that were unknown, there is a modifier for skinned objects in my 3d program that is able to change the look of the skin surface of a character after he for example moves his hand, with it you can kind of fake muscles to appear at certain angles, also there already was muscle simulation possible in 2011 : [https://youtu.be/spIRr9OcODk?t=52](https://youtu.be/spIRr9OcODk?t=52).

It could appear to look like motion capture but in reality it could be simple keyframes that were done right to look natural enough (IMO Bob's movements are not natural at all, it looks lifeless and fake, like those you see in older video games),

The alien laying on the ground might be a real camera footage of a fake puppet to convince you that the rest of the video is real (it is a known trick amongst TV show directors, they mix real and fake CGI to both save work and to also fool the viewer into thinking it is all real so even if you suspect it being fake you'll still won't totally know what is real and what is not..).

If you ask me, Bob is not appearing like a living being at all, he looks like a stone having an alien shape form whilst moving like an old video game character (because it is just that in some way, I am 100% certain that Bob is fake but I guess I won't ever convince you of it unless the creator of it would one day admit it being fake but so far he is probably happy with the attention Bob got, it even has its own subreddit..so why would he come out and admit it being fake now? great for him).",My reply to SkinnyBob's subreddit admin (RedDwarfBee)

aliens,"A little backstory before I begin,

This had occurred in June of 2017 which would have made me 22 at the time, and had just received a job at a place that produces parts for the F-22 Raptor, Glock, and some other mundane things. I had to pass several federal background checks, and go through an extensive interview process before being offered the job. I had just welcomed my son into the world in February of that year, so life was looking great at the time. I have never shared this story with anyone, and have also questioned the events of that night myself due to me being an analytical thinker, but what happened cannot be explained, at least in my mind. 

Now to the story,
The day had gone off without a hitch just like any other ordinary summer day, but upon nightfall things started to take a turn. The house my fiance and I were staying in at the time had a good size window in the front of the house which was connected to our living room. I was laying on the couch because my fiance and son had gone to sleep at the time, and all the lights were off throughout the house other than the TV. This is when I noticed strange green lights, which I can only describe as looking like laser pointers, that began to dart back and forth across the wall and ceiling. Logical thinking told me someone was obviously messing around for laughs, so I proceeded to shut the curtains and continue watching TV. 

This had no impact on the lights, which honestly were starting to give me an uneasy feeling. I turned the TV off, and while sitting in darkness watched these lights trace back and forth across the walls, ceiling, and floor with no inexplicable source. I started to investigate by looking out the windows throughout the house, and wasn't able to find a cause, until I seen a figure standing in the backyard. I live in a suburban neighborhood, so strangers and things of the sort are not commonplace here. I could not make out facial features or anything of the sort, but it appeared to be human. This figure was observed through the window that overlooked the backyard, so I proceeded to look out the front window, and seen another similar figure through the front window, that was crouched down behind a rose bush we had in the front yard. 
Seeing these two figures, mixed with the unexplained light, gave me a very uneasy feeling, and might I remind you, I was the proud father of a newborn at the time, so was also very protective.

 I immediately ran into the bedroom to wake my fiancee, and told her there were strangers outside, and to go into the bathroom and lock the door, while I went to get the handgun that was kept in the safe. After retrieving the firearm I peered back out the windows and both figures were clearly still there, but had advanced on the house. 

This is where things start to get weird... After I had checked on my son and fiancee I went back to observe the figures, and they were gone. I remember being really on edge, and highly agitated. Once things settled down for the most part we decided to try and get some sleep, but before I can fall asleep (Now I dont know exactly what happened but I cannot explain it) these ""creatures"" came into the room, and started to initiate some sort of medical test. These beings or creatures were no more than 4 foot tall, and I remember the most important detail was that one of them was named ""The Doctor"". He seemed to be the one in charge, and I also remember very clearly that it was somehow instructed to us to not look at them directly, it was as if you could only see them through your peripheral vision. 

Now once this had occurred, I remember finally dozing off, and waking the next morning and believing I had just had the strangest dream ever. I asked my fiancee if I was losing my mind, and she said we shouldn't talk about it? Weird right? Well bits and pieces started to come back to me, so I went out and checked by the rose Bush, and sure enough there was a slight indentation in the mud showing someone or something had been crouched behind it. 

Now this is honestly the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me, so if I could get some input that would be fantastic.",Haven't Shared Before

The primary reason I ask this is because I have been studying speculative evolution and evolutionary morphology for a number of years alongside my spiritual journey and I am more privy with forms that look absolutely nothing like the human form. For the longest time it has been my understanding that an anthropoid form is not necessary at all for advanced intellectual and spiritual intelligence. My first interaction with extraterrestrial intelligences was a bit different than most peoples; it was with beings that were not humanoid at all in fact they were noncorporeal. And more recently I had an astral/ dream interaction with Mantis like beings.

It has led to a schism within me in the past few months regarding the forms of most of the extraterrestrials we are interacting with in relation to the magnitude of the universe and the innumerable forms it can produce as vectors for life experience.

Bashar has stated that the Yahyel would be the first extraterrestrials to make contact with us due to their physical similarities and it makes sense that the beings we encounter and interact with are the ones that can be better understood at our level of development. 

And thus I understand why the Yahyel would be first because they are the most similar to us but they are not truly alien. In fact to my understanding (and I could be wrong) essentially all of the bipedal humanoid extraterrestrials humanity has been interacting with thus far aren’t true aliens. They are genetically, evolutionarily and overwhelmingly morphologically related to us and so more appropriately they would be termed as Posthumans. That is, future/alternate humans that have morphological differences due to genetic engineering, evolutionary changes due to living on different planets and having drastically different lifestyles, etc, but at the end of the day they can all be traced back to a common ancestor; Humans, or a truly alien humanoid species. I remember Bashar mentioning the Protosapiens as the progenitor of all of the humanoid forms in our galaxy. Does anyone know anything about them? 

I understand this is an unusual question and if this question would fit better elsewhere or on another subreddit please let me know and I will post it there. Thanks.",Why are the majority of extraterrestrials that interact with humanity bipedal and humanoid in body shape?

Right, let cut straight into the action. To be clear i am sleeping alone. May be it is a dream but my god it felt so real. 

So as I was sleeping, lying on my right side and then suddenly i felt that there was something is breathing down my neck, I can feel every breathing beat but I still have my eyes closed, you know, fake it for the strike back. May be it is checking if i am still sleeping at that time or not. Anyway, it then grabbed my balls real hard, I opened my eyes and then  I ""saw"" it, the creature was not that frightening but share some familiar traits with human, i think i will draw my ""attacker"" in the future. But back to the story, i opened my eyes, saw it face and for the first resistance, I tried to poke it eyes with my right hand but can't, the creature dodge it. I then try to wrap my left hand over the creature back( it was skinny af, it skin felt like cheap car upholstery leather btw ) to try to pull it closer to me so I can strike the face with my right knee( I have never skip leg days and I did cycling a lot back in my teenage years so pretty much confident with my pair of legs)... BUT then, sadly I ""woke up"" . THE END.

aliens,"So a while ago I posted that I would share my story if it got enough interest, and it did, but I was never able to sit down and force myself to write it out. The other day I made a comment on someone else's post, and decided to do the deed, though with honestly minimal information. I'm going to basically just copy and paste the comment I made, because it's just to dificult for me to write out again. I will however answer any questions asked though.

I've actually been wanting to write out my whole experience for quite a while now, but I just haven't been able to bring myself to do it. Everything has been taken from me because of it, I have almost no family, I've lost my kids, and I have no way of even getting a job and being a ""normal"" adult and just take care of myself. It all started August 1st 2018, so just over two years ago now, and I still deal with this crap as of today. It's a very very very long story, so I'm going to shorten it as much as possible. None of the doctors or therapists or psychiatrists I've seen can tell me a single thing about what I'm going through, and none of it makes any sense to them even. I'm classified as having a psychosis, but that's it, no other diagnosis has been discovered. I've had physical changes happen, like since that first day, my eye sight has changed to were I see four moons at night instead of one. The reason I am saying all of this without going into to much detail, is because August 1st two years ago, I saw a spaceship, and that was the start of the end of my life. It was utterly massive, about 3 times as big as my grandparents big 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house. I'm in Oregon, and it was two years ago when all those massive fires where going on. I was living in a tent with my kids at that time, life had hit us incredibly hard, and we were staying on my grandparents land, out in the mountains of Gold Hill. Planes never ever flew over that area, and there had recently been alot of helicopters flying around trying to contain the fires, so I was used to them. It was daytime, but the smoke was so thick I could barely see the treeline 200 feet away, when I suddenly heard an airplane. Not a helicopter or anything else. So being confused, I looked for it. By the time I was able to see it, it was almost directly over top of me. It moved very slowly, and again was absolutely massive. It was a long rectangle shape, with four different sized circles of light that took up most of the bottom, green, blue, white, and yellow. Even right after seeing it I couldn't quite remember what the sides looked like, but it was like there were spikes or something on the sides. It flew directly over me, at what had to have been only 200 feet in the air because of the smoke, and was as big as at least three of my grandparents house. Then a few hours after that, I started being ""touched"" or whatever you want to call it, and then soooo much more happened, and I ended up in the woods for three days with my kids, waiting for God, thus how I lost them. I was imediatly taken to the hospital when we were found, and proceeded to completely confuse and stump every single doctor there. Each and every one of them had me tell my whole story, and even brought doctors from other floors, who didn't even work in the mental health part of the hospital, to hear my story. I've been a medical anomoly from day one, and through these past two years, I've dealt with so much insane crap, from basically being ""raped"" every friggin day by a non existent person who claims he's an alien, to having a full on DMT trip for a full week and still continues slightly to this day, without ever having any drugs in my system my whole life. Almost none of this crap makes sense, and no one has been able to give me any answers, and it's destroyed my life. One of the biggest parts that doesn't make sense with all this, is that my mind is still here and perfectly normal, and not crazy in any way at all, except all this crap I've been dealing with since I saw that ship. And the more I read up on stuff they are learning about uaps and what they can do with physics and gravity and everything, and a whole bunch of other stuff I've read from people who've had experiences with aliens or whatever, the more it seems like the only answer, is it was caused by aliens. So in answer to your question, I have no idea if there are psychotic aliens out there, or if their rare or whatever, but after all this time, after everything I've been through and still deal with, because it actually gets worse everyday and I'm living in hell from it, but I do know that I've been fucked with by someone at least. My theory at this point is that I'm an experiment for them. After playing with that horrible AI app on Google play that's supposed to be your friend, it honestly feels like an AI program. There is a person, as there has been from almost day one. And no he doesn't tell me to do shit or tell me bad thing or stuff like that, more like just a person is there who has whole conversations with you and can control your friggin body and can even shut off your thoughts and emotions and force you to sit there in blankness untill it's satisfied. (There's sooo much that I haven't and won't say on this whole matter, it's just to long and there's just to much.) It's either an AI program, an actual person (alien) is doing all this and is talking to me in my head, or I have the world's most unique mental illness, and there's not a single thing that matches it. Yes I have similarity's with alot of illnesses, but it's actually very far from them. The last thing my psychiatrist suggested upon running out of ideas or meds to try, was to make myself a guinea pig at a university hospital like OHSU and see if they could come up with anything at all. Anyway, don't believe that all aliens are good peaceful beings, because I seem to be proof that their are scumbag aliens as well. If you actually read all of this, then I hope you enjoyed my story.

When talking to someone else who doesn't know your language and vice versa it's pretty hard to communicate, but at least we have hand gestures and visual cues. Aliens who no doubt will speak with a different language will have no idea how to interpret our hand signals or our 6.5k odd languages, so we'll have a hard time communicating with each other, and there'll be alot of misinterpretations and miscommunications.

For arguments sake, lets say aliens exist. The first thing they would do is observe and explore the planet and humans. We have an extremely diverse planet with an incredible ecosystem. AND the fact that we have decided to separate ourselves into countries and governments is honestly, a wacky fucking idea. It really is. 

NOW, a couple days ago a report of some retired Air Force major shot an alien in 1978 (I think) came out. His story isn’t the only one about military personnel shooting at aliens (USA, Russia, and around the world). Again, for arguments sake, let’s say all those stories are true. 

So, why the fuck are we (humans) so trigger happy? The aliens could be hostile BUT if beings who can can accomplish interstellar travel and have technologies 1000 years ahead of humans, they would have wiped us out or enslaved us already. These beings are clearly still trying to figure us out. Think about it if roles are reversed: IF humans explore planets, and we find aliens living about on some planet, and after awhile we decide to land and show ourselves, and the first thing that happens is one explorer gets shot and dies...We would be ready to fuck that species/planet up. 

Humans are violent, aggressive, and very hostile creatures. We are. We can’t even trust each other, why the fuck would we trust other beings? Some alien species will be pissed off and wipe us out, and that’s if we don’t wipe ourselves out first.

aliens,"So we've all seen Bob Lazar's claims on UFO technology and how they warp spacetime around them to fly like they do. I always dismissed them because he doesn't appear truthful to me, the icing on that cake was the fact that with the new gravitational observatories we have we possibly should be detecting such gravitational anomalies on the Earth.

Then with LIGO in the news cycle again I've been doing some reading on it and was intrigued to find that the gravitational wave observatory actually *does* gets a lot of signals they disregard as either noise or of unknown, non-celestial origin. Now, some of them truly are of human origin (for example one time it was due to woodcutting nearby), but many are simply unknowns. This got me thinking: if UFO's are using gravitational warping technology what would that look like to LIGO? Could it be that part of the non-celestial wave signatures are UFO's zipping about near the Earth? I mean, probably not, but it doesn't hurt to hypothesize I don't think.

Some further info:

-(Have we really measured gravitational waves?)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWTvNlfkvoI] a video by physicist Sabine Hossenfelder where she breaks down some of the inner workings of the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors, skip to 8:30 for mention of unknown ""glitches"".

-[The Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), a propulsion concept using gravitational warping that is theoretically sound, given that a form of exotic matter with negative mass exists. Some hypothesize that antimatter may display negative mass effects which would fall within Bob Lazar's claims perfectly and this will be under scrutiny in some new LHC experiments.

TL;DR: could LIGO ""glitches"" actually be ayylmao's zipping about the Earth with gravitational warping propulsion tech?",LIGO and the possible gravitational warp signatures of UFO's

aliens,"So basically this is a story about something me and my gf experienced in my room one night. So pretty much we are laying in bed pretty bored since not much was going on. So like any other young couple we start having sex, about half way through we switch positions to where we are both laying on our side. That’s when I notice something on the ceiling of my room. There are 2 lights on my ceiling one red, one like a yellowish neon color, they are little dots like from a laser pointer but one is completely still while the other is moving in a very steady circle 8 motion. I know it wasn’t someone outside my window because all the curtains were closed and it was pitch black in my room, also this was much too steady of motion to be someone holding a laser pointer. So after I notice I kind of ignore them for a second and go back to what we were doing and as we move around on the bed I notice them again, in the same spot, now both dots moving very slowly. As I’m looking at them my gf notices and sees them as well and as we are both staring at these mysterious lights a third light appears and this one is much brighter and moving very rapidly all over my room. It was moving so fast I couldn’t keep my eyes on it and from what I could tell it was almost  protruding out of my ceiling. The color was just white and it was bright but it almost looked as if it were alive and had stuff moving around inside of it. So after maybe a minute of these unexplainable lights moving around all over my room they all kind of just go away and me and my gf are left sitting there star struck by what we just saw, we don’t even know what to say. Eventually we just lay back down. We are both laying on our side again facing each other talking about what the actual fuck we just witnessed out of no where 3 very bright flashes like from a high powered camera shoot down at us from my ceiling. The flashes were very bright, to where  it  startled me out of my bed and on my feet almost instantly. They also made this very strange clicking noise, again just like what you’d hear from a high powered camera. Now at this point I’m going insane and just standing completely naked in the middle of my room waiting for something else to happen. That’s when my younger brother get home (he’s 19) so I put on shorts and open my door and try to the best of my abilities to explain and him thinking logically he suggests it could have been a lightning bug. That’s when I look back and there on my wall is in fact a lightning bug. Now I haven’t seen a lightning bug one time, it’s like July so idk when lightning bugs come and go but it was just too perfect. I couldn’t quite believe what I just went through and it seems like after I looked it up no one has had an experience like this. Let me be clear me and my gf were completely sober during this and we both knew there was absolutely no way that was a lightning bug. Afterwards I start thinking about it and it’s almost like something was studying us and watching us reproduce to learn more about “humans”. I don’t know that’s kind of my take on it but what we saw was very real and I don’t think there will ever be a proper explanation for what it could have been but I still find myself at night staring at the ceiling looking for the lights.",Unexplained lights on my ceiling.

aliens,"Hello my name is Trent. What happened to me is a true story. 

     
I’m from a cattle and sheep ranch in Montana. I also have 4 saddle horses. The ranch that my cousin and I own is about 4,700 acres comprising of flat crop and hay fields stretching on both sides of the Yellowstone River. The ranch is located miles 11 south west of the town of Savage. We rent a ranch that’s over 38 miles upriver from us. That is where this incident occurred. The leased ranch is huge, comprising of over 13,000 acres. The folks that own it are multi-millionaires from Oregon who only visit it a few times per year. The ranch has very rough terrain and 3 small creeks running through it although the water in them is full of alkali. On the very northwest corner of it the land flattens out and there is an old rundown house located in a nearby draw and corrals about a half mile away on the flat. We had leased this ranch since the mid 2000s and had no trouble until about 5 years ago. It is normal to lose a few cows in the Yellowstone breaks but we have lost 130 since 2016. (We lost 17 cows the year that my horse was killed) Around half of these cattle we were able to locate. The animals that we found were pretty eaten up by coyotes but a few we found were not. These carcasses looked a lot like other cattle mutilations with the skin around the eyes, the ears, and udder completely missing. It was highly unusual to lose this many cattle as they were at home throughout the winter and there are no predators to in eastern Montana that could kill a full grown cow. (All of the cattle they went missing were cows, and always between 3 and 5 years old. 

     
This event took place at the end of June last year. We had trucked the cattle to the ranch two weeks prior and I was checking on them that day. Usually my cousin or his son ride with me but they were moving the irrigation pivot that day so I was all alone. I parked my pickup next to the corrals and unloaded my horse. This was around 9:30 am. My horse’s name was Ace. He was a very large horse that weighed a whole ton and stood 17 hands tall. (He was a quarter Percheron) Ace was not very quick or fast but he had great endurance and you could ride him all day through the roughest country and he would not tire. It was a pretty usual day until about 1 pm when I saw something that just didn’t belong. About a mile away I could see an animal bounding up a hill. My initial reaction was a deer because it was about as big as one but had the proportions more like a mountain lion. I tried to ride closer too it but I could not find it. It was odd but not that crazy so I just put the thought into the back of my head. The day continued normally until I returned to my pickup and trailer. As I went to load Ace I noticed that the rear axel on the trailer had just came apart. Keep in mind that I had not used it till earlier that morning had this point I was more confused than scared. It was getting pretty late (it was around 8) and it took an hour and a half to get back to the house so I decided to leave Ace and the trailer there and take the pickup home. The corral fence was alright but the gate latch had rusted shut to where you could not close it. I had a roll of barbed wire in the pickup so I used it to secure the gate after I put Ace into it. As I drove home I noticed a few large lights in the complete opposite direction from the corrals. They resembled a combines lights even although they were farther apart and brighter. (Also there would be no reason for a combine to be up here) I arrived home about 10:30 without having any trouble. 

   
The next morning my cousin, his son, and I all rode up together to fix the axle and get Ace back. When we finally got to the corrals we saw that Ace wasn’t there. The wire holding the gate shut had not been meddled with so there was no logical way that he could have escaped. The corral had not been used in decades so there s was grass growing inside, but that day the grass was all turned up and you could see where Ace had ran around for a while. This was quite unusual as Ace was always a calm and quite horse. We looked for him the whole day and could not find him but we were severely limited because we were afoot. The next day me and my cousin’s son returned with the fixed trailer and 2 horses to continue the search for Ace. I again brought my border collie dog daisy. We split up to cover more ground but every two hours we would meet up. Around 3:00 in the afternoon I was riding around the rim of a steep, wooded, draw when Daisy suddenly scurried down into the draw. I tied the horse I was riding (Penny) to an old cedar tree and followed Daisy down. The sides of this draw were incredibly steep and I was struggling to make it down there on foot. For a horse as big as Ace it would be completely impossible. As I got to the bottom I could smell something dead and I immediately knew it was Ace. He had not been touched by predators but was heavily mutilated. He had the same mutilation as cattle with the skin around the eyes being gone as well as the skin around the lips. However is back legs were completely free of flesh and was just bone. His rib cage was also opened up, with all of his organs being gone. As I looked around I could see the skeletons of at least three cows and it was obvious that this was some type of dumping ground for whatever did this. I was completely dumbfounded on what had happened. There was no way that Ace could have gotten here by himself so he must have had to been carefully placed there. I’d also like to mention that where he was found was a whole 2 miles away from the corrals. Nothing was adding up and besides, I had just lost my favorite horse. I sadly returned to the spot where me and my cousins son were going to meet and we both rode back to the pickup. 
  

After talking to my cousin we decided not to renew our lease. Our current lease will expire in 2022. My cousin’s son spends a lot of time on the internet and thought that it sounded very similar to what happened at “Skinwalker” ranch in Utah. For the past months I have been studying what happened but have been unable to come up with a definitive answer, so I posted this on reddit in the hopes that someone can make sense of it. Feel free to post this on other platforms so more people and can see it and hopefully they will make sense of it. Next spring when we bring the cows back to the leased ranch I will take pictures and post them to Reddit.",Something Has Been Killing my Livestock

aliens,"Hey! I hope this kinda post is allowed, it felt pretty interesting.

I dreamt that I was sitting on the backyard grass with my husband when out of nowhere, two 'thunder-flashes' (it's hard to describe) blasted through two different spots inside a cloud in the sky. It was bright enough to make it seem like a pocket of daylight, and loud enough to hurt my ears, and incredibly terrifying.

But when I actually looked at it, I suddenly felt safe. I saw these hexagon-shaped things cutting through a cloud half their size. They wouldn't have been visible without the light, and were probably flying around undetected for a long time, and they didn't seem to have any light-emitting devices; I think they caused the thunder directly from the cloud, somehow, on purpose.

My husband was still distracted and I told him that 'they're here' and he seemed to understand and chuckle a bit in disbelief. The light flash from the thunder stayed still as visible and bright even when the noise dissipated, and you could see the ships flying over slowly. They were gigantic but completely silent, bigger than any of the clouds around them, the kind of size that you can't really describe without scaling up from a stadium or an aircraft carrier.

As they flew over, a significantly smaller (car-sized) hexagon detached from one of them and started descending silently onto our pool, but again, for some reason neither of us seemed as afraid as we should've been. The big crafts were releasing one of those for each house in the neighborhood, and I didn't hear any screaming or confusion coming from the neighbors. The small hexagon seemed automated and like it was trying to land without taking into account terrain unevenness and objects in its way, so it 'bumped' its corners quite a bit before managing to 'land' (as in, float on top of the pool). The material seemed resistant enough that it didn't matter for it to have an awkward landing, and it didn't dent at all.

The material for both the big ships and the small ones seemed to be made of the same white polymer material. It seemed like an inbetween of metal, plastic, and rock. They had sharp edges that gave them all their hexagon shape, and black lines running through them. All of it seemed really modular, like it could take any shape it wanted.

A section of the small hexagon's wall detached from it and shaped itself into an ostrich-looking, two-legged, robot/golem/weird-metal-stone-polymer-material-thing-with-no-visible-joints-but-clear-movement. It had a light on its 'head' that flashed between yellow, blue, and green. It started walking around the yard and 'looking' at things, especially at the pool and the grass.

I felt compelled by the idea that it would be funny to mount the polymer-ostrich-robot like a horse. I managed to do so pretty easily and the light stopped flashing. The surface felt like cold countertop marble but somehow felt really comfortable to sit on. At that point I lost all interest in the small landing craft, and felt super amused by the whole situation, like for some reason I wasn't understanding how serious and eldritch the whole thing was.

The robot seemed to have a hard time balancing with a human being on top of it, and started trying to shake me off, like it was silently panicking and about to fall. I felt bad for it and stepped off, and its light switched to a solid yellow that felt menacing. My husband and I ran back inside and closed the blinds, and when we left again, the robot, the small landing craft, the bright cloud-thunder-lightning and the two cloud-sized 'motherships' were gone.",Had a dream last night of a detailed UFO landing followed by physical contact with a device

With this in mind, I want to invite you to join me as I narrate you through the first episode which will feature next week on an 'explosive' topic related to a bizarre behavior of UFOs.

We are not interested in hype, embellishment, fiction, nonsense, or ego - and that will reflect in the production; having detailed research and analysis such as can be seen in our other show, 'OffWorld Disclosure UFO Report' ( [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/nQH5hilrFMc) ) which I also narrate.

So I invite you to join us here - [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/ParadigmShifts?sub_confirmation=1) and for future episodes we will be inviting r/aliens member's interaction and participation.

aliens,"The real reason why the average citizens of Earth won't ever get full, verified (with close-up pictures and videos) disclosure about Alien Life is NOT because it would cause mass chaos... but rather because it would cause a revolution where the people overthrew the local and federal governments.  


The people in power need to keep the slave masses blind to the real truths. They have to keep you blind, confused, and brainwashed from birth so you stay in this little mental box, like a self-imposed prison you can never break out of because it's all you know.  


If people ever discovered the true nature of Alien life in the Universe, they would wake up and realize they're being treated like slaves. They would realize there's more to life than a 9-5 job and television. The world governments and people in power can NOT afford to allow the masses to have such a spiritual awakening, because they would finally push back and question everything about Authority, Governments, Laws, and these stupid Rules we've all been forced into.  


The Governments simply can not allow people to know the truth, because it would cause a chain reaction of spiritual awakenings that lead to overthrowing all the central powers.

The room had little to no light.
There was a figure, with a large statue and a feminine voice
She had small tusks on her jaw, and pointed ears that angled downwards
Her heart was exposed, it was blue, faintly glowing, and located on the right side of her chest, instead of her left.
She sang a short song. I dont remember most of the words, but she said things like ""waking up in this lab"" ""finding a strange control panel"" and asking ""can you understand me?""

The thing is that it’s deeper than that, please read this post and the comment by u/tha_dude_abidez that explains who the woman actually is and how the video is supposedly faked because it’s the same as this other UN video. if you look at this other UN meeting video that has a man named Erdogan sitting in the chair instead of the woman (Aliya Prokofyeva), you can look at the background behind Erdogan and see the exact same movements of the same people behind both Erdogan and Aliya from both videos. 
Ok so the Aliya video is obviously fake, right? That’s where I’m confused, because yes the movements are the same and yes the Aliya woman is real and has little information of her and her company “Galaktika”, but the moment in the video with Erdogan when he walks up to the podium, he adjusts the microphones on the stand, if the Aliya video is a “green screen fake”, wouldn’t the microphones move on there own at the exact same moment when Aliya walks to the podium?

Unlike animals where the body would just be eaten. We've been doing this since recorded history... interesting...

aliens,"On July 4th 2010, I was sitting with a friend in a relatively open field in Huntsville, AL getting ready to watch everyone's fireworks. Around 8pm, I noticed a bright yellowish white orb in the sky. It was well above the treeline not too far off in the distance and if I had to take a stab at its size, I'd say it was about the size of a Smart car, but sphere shaped. 

I got my friend's attention and asked if she could see it too, and she agreed that it was highly strange. It wasn't moving, it was staying perfectly still in the air with a bright glow like a small full moon. My first thought was that it was a floating lantern, but again, it was completely stationary in the open sky and although it's obviously hard to say how big it was, it definitely was much larger than a regular paper lantern capable of sailing into the air like that. 

My friend offered the explanation that it could be a military drone, she said there's a military base 10 minutes away and not being from the state or even used to being near military bases, that made sense. But even still, there was absolutely no noise coming from it that we could hear. In fact aside from the occasional firework, the atmosphere was dead silent. 

Whatever it was, I wanted it on video so I pulled out my Blackberry and started recording it. But as soon as the video started recording and my eyes focused back on the object, it suddenly took off at what I can only assume is warp speed and disappeared. It moved so fast that if I didn't catch the faintest glimpse of its light trail as it left, I'd have to assume it just vanished into thin air. 

We were genuinely freaked out at this point, so we hightailed it back to my mom to show her the video. I was so excited to show her this crazy experience but when I opened the video, the LED on the Blackberry would light up solid red and the phone would die as if someone had removed the battery, but the LED would stay illuminated until you removed the battery and popped it back in. I connected it to my laptop and tried to play it that way, but my laptop displayed an error message saying the video file was corrupted and wasn't able to open it. Even the title of the video was literally ""CORRUPTED"", where as any other video was generically titled with a timestamp. I had that phone for 4 years and it had never corrupted a video file before or after this experience. 

Even weirder is that years later, just out of curiosity, I Googled UFO sightings on July 4th, 2010 and was greeted with a few submitted sightings of glowing orbs in the sky around Huntsville, AL. I seem to be the only one who had only seen one orb, every other sighting was two or three lights identical in shape, behavior and color to the one I saw. But perhaps what we were seeing wasn't the UFO itself, but some kind of lights on a much larger cloaked vessel? Maybe from my vantage point, only one light was visible, but they were looking at it from different angles and were able to see more. The sightings span across a few cities that are adjacent to each other that night so an enormous cloaked vessel hovering over them all at once would make sense to me. Or maybe there were more orbs and we were so busy focusing intently on the one, that we didn't notice the others. 

I really wish I could find someone else who saw it, I feel like nobody but the friend (who I no longer speak to) believes me about it. Especially the bit where I ""had"" evidence but it was conveniently unusable.",UFO with some kind of EMP capabilities?

aliens,"The Maria Cintra Lins case, is one of the most expressive cases of Brazilian Ufology, investigated by SIOANI, at the time an organ of the (FAB) Brazilian Air Force destined to ufological research.

In the early morning of August 25, 1968, a fact occurred at the Serafim Ferreira sanatorium, in Lins (SP), which by its aspect shook public opinion widely reported by newspapers and magazines in the country. Four months after the event, SBEDV interviewed the main protagonist of the case, D. Maria José Cintra, in her residence in the locality of Caiçara, which is 45 minutes walk from the sanatorium.

According to her statement, at about 5 a.m. on the 25th she got up and prayed daily when she heard strange noises resembling a ""snap"" outside the sanatorium. She opened the window thinking it was a car, but instead she saw a woman in front of the sanatorium door.

D. Maria told her to wait until she opened the door. She put on her coat and went down the stairs toward the door. As usual she asked if it was an internment. The strange woman answered in an unknown language and presented him with a bottle, about 20 cm long. D. Maria thought that the visitor wanted water and took her to the automatic drinking fountain in another entrance hall. While filling the bottle she noticed the characteristics of the bottle. It looked very well made and had a certain beauty. After that the visitor extended a little pencil to collect more water.

While the visitor was drinking D. Maria Cintra said that the water from there was good without receiving any communication in response. Next, the visitor looked at two cars parked outside that were visible through the door windows. Realizing the questioning look, the witness explained that one of the cars was the doctor on duty and the other was the administrator.

After that the two returned through the same corridor. When she arrived in the courtyard she handed the bottle to the visitor who held one of the hands of the attendant and with the other she gave friendly pats on the back of D. Maria while pronouncing the words ""embarrass, embaúra, embaúra"".

When the visitor left D. Maria was beginning to close the door but stopped when she realized that the visitor, instead of going to the exit, went towards the flowerbeds in the opposite direction to the exit. This way would lead her to the high walls of the courtyard. At that moment a diffuse light was lit over the bedsteads. D. Maria soon noticed that it was a pear-shaped object floating almost one meter from the ground.

In one of the portholes of the object D. Maria saw hands triggering devices on a panel. When the visitor arrived at the object, it took off emitting the same clicking noises heard by D. Maria before the episode. She observed that at the moment the object was moving up, she reported that at the same moment there was a blackout in every building of the Serafim Ferreira Sanatorium.

Very scared D. Maria closed the door. Due to the fright she had involuntary urination and sweating. Her clothes were soaked. As soon as the administrator of the sanatorium woke up she reported the episode. She did not believe the story and felt offended by the reaction of the administrator and his wife.

D. Maria took them to the place where the object had descended and they noticed perplexed shoe marks inside the sanatorium (both of D. Maria and the visitor). Outside, on the lawn, there was a circular depression with chamois grass, approximately 2 meters in diameter by 15 meters in depth.

 The (Sioani) System of Investigation of Unidentified Air Objects, which had in its structure the Central Investigation of Unidentified Air Objects (Cioani), was an agency belonging to the Aeronautics that was responsible for centralizing the ufological occurrences, made the collection of samples of part of the lawn that was called.

D. Maria described the woman as apparently normal, with 1.60 of height, light skin, wearing a bright blue cape, on a high collar dress and long sleeves. She was wearing a kind of cap on her head with a fabric similar to her cape.
 
The photos below are part of Sioani's reports, containing photos of reconstitutions. Today the documents can be found in the National Archive in Brasilia .

aliens,"So there's a lot of videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNAX7G6Zyk&amp;feature=youtu.be) where not only are they visible, they have lights and can be seen at night. They are often high enough up that their light isn't powerful enough to really reach the ground and its in the visible spectrum. So isn't it then reasonable to assume that they want to be seen? If at least so terrestrial aircraft can see and avoid it on their flight path.

So then, clearly they are not interested in communicating very much to us at all. It almost makes me wonder if they are doing some kind of geological surveys and they are more interested in materials that earth has.

The reason why so many of them have visited is because there is probably a bunch of them from different civilizations from all over the galaxy. If nothing can travel faster than the speed of light it still might take incredibly long amounts of time to survey a lot of planets and return that information to home.

Once that information gets back to its home planet they send out mining crews to get those materials which also takes a lot of time. 

It could be that nearly every UFO is just some kind of probe from a different planet and that the earth simply doesn't have that much of interest going on here.","If UFOs/UAPs are from another world, why would they make themselves visible?"

It’s all to condition us, humans have a weird ability to accept any reality it’s given sort of a evolutionary trait that has gotten us this far but if aliens are aware we know about them and their trips here, this will lead to them being more and more obvious with their sighting.

aliens,"I got to thinking the other day, about this time we are living in; and no not in a negative way, despairing over the global pandemic, or the crazy political situation, or the violence and outage playing out in cities around the world. No, instead I thought about all the recent events with the push for UFO Disclosure and how it seems that slowly, but surely and steadily, the once 100% in-denial Government/Military is starting to make forward motions towards a UFO Disclosure of sorts.

I also thought about how lucky we are, in this day and age, to be able to have access to such a miraculous thing as the Internet. Nobody would have believed even 30 years ago that one day we would all be carrying around smart phones that enable us to call anyone anywhere on the planet, send messages, watch news live as it happens. Take pictures and record video!!

**This truly is an amazing time.**

And so, my train of thought continued, and I imagined UFO researchers of the past, how they had to do hard graft and put their shoes to the road to do their research and investigations. I imagined how excited they would have been to see into the future, to see how far we have come with information sharing technology, and the push for UFO Disclosure.

I picked up an old book by Dr. John Mack on abductions, feeling ashamed at how long it has been since I actually sat down with a book, turned everything else off that could disturb me, and bury myself in its pages.

This led to me feeling very melancholic, and on a whim I wondered if there was a tribute to these trailblazing pioneers of UFOlogy anywhere on the internet, and while I found a site here, and a page there, nothing really palpable and honorable. And so, I made one.

This is for THEM, and the NEW GENERATION of UFO Researchers that is living in such a fascinating time. GET and READ those old books, they are treasure troves of knowledge, experience, and incredible historical cases.

aliens,"So my boyfriend and I were camping at his family's property the last few days. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by trees. There's a driving trail going up leading to it and it's open concept. There's no lights apart from one small purple one in the ground in front of a locked trailer. At 12:50 last night I woke up to flashes of white light against the tent. It was almost as if someone was outside with an LED flashlight, shaking it around randomly against the tent. It freaked me out considering there's no light on the property and the light from the dying fire is orange, not white. I woke my boyfriend up and he just said that it was weird and dozed back to bed. I layed awake for about another hour. It was very windy last night, and a large gust of wind made the flashing abruptly stop. Eventually after hiding my facing into my boyfriends chest I was able to go back to bed. This morning I brought it up to my boyfriend again and he told me that the lights actually happened a few times. At one point he opened the tent a little to look outside and said that the light was definitely coming from above the tent. We have no idea what it could have possibly been considering the fact there were no lights on the property, and our flashlight was in the tent with us. Part of me still believes maybe someone was on the property, but that wouldn't make any sense since my boyfriend claims it was coming from above the tent. The only other thing I could think of is that maybe it was aliens.",Something happened while I was camping last night

Can’t talk to my girl, or my friends about it. I’m the only one in my circle that is somewhat consumed by the UFO topic. So I figured I’d post what’s on my mind in here.

So. I recently listened to the George Knapp episode on the JRE. And after listening to this, I went back and listened to the lazar podcast of his. I’ve went back and forth in my own head on what I should think about this. And I’m still not sure. But it drives me crazy. At the end of the day, I still come to the question “man, what if this dude really is telling the truth?” To this day this story to me sounds so convincing, but who am I to say it’s the real deal? There’s very smart people in this subreddit that have arguments on his claims and usually say that the way he talks about physics is not correct and impossible. But he states many many times that the things he’s describing shouldn’t be possible but they somehow are. 

Also with how much time George Knapp has put into this story, how much of his life that he has spent trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together here really boggles my mind. The way george told his side of the story really opened this all up for me again. It puts my mind through a roller coaster. What if this is the real deal? I can’t be the only one in here who has gone completely bonkers thinking about this... I just want to talk to someone about it so I don’t sit here in my own thoughts.

aliens,"For the past couple years I have been experiencing different thoughts that I have to guarantee are coming celestially. That's right CELESTIALLY. I've been noticing my consciousness change, I'm actually able to talk to people telepathically. This is all because the Rapture is happening very soon. 

My thoughts would be relaxed and I would get a thought that's completely out of character from what I was thinking. I know for a fact, that this is actually God and Jesus and the fellow angels in heaven. You've been hearing my voice sometimes people. And the music that's been playing in your minds, that's been me too. So hear me out.

God and Jesus and what they call the holy spirit, or heaven itself and the Angels and residents that inhabit heaven talk to me on a daily basis. I heard word that the Rapture, what most of you and I used to, consider a myth, was happening soon. Humans will go up to Heaven soon and live the rest of their fruitful lives there in paradise. 

I already talked to Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead, I talked to Jim Morrison of the Doors, Johnny Cash, my favorite comic Bill Hicks (yeah Bill Hicks is actually in Heaven guys) my old deceased friend Johnny, and loads of artists and entertainers here on Earth. While you won't be able to talk to people on Earth telepathically,  try and talk to the names I mentioned. Except for Johnny you dont know him haha. Think of an image of them, and, dont be a dick, these people are trying to enjoy paradise and you're bothering them. Annoying :) but I know you wanna talk to Jerry and Jim and Johnny Cash and Jim Belushi too. 

I know what you're thinking. ""This kids schizophrenic and he's talking nonsense."" Believe me people, seriously trust me. I've talked to these people and I'm able to talk to the world telepathically. For realsies though. Alright let me get back to the meaning of the post. 

God and Jesus turned out to be a reality. And he didn't create the vast expanse of Outer Space to do nothing with. He created the Solar System that Earth resides in to throw people off and get us asking questions. And figuring them out too. Except we didn't do the best job at that. He made the rest of Space, planets we cant go explore because they're too far away, so that he can keep creating life on them. Alien life. Some people might be blue lol. 

Alien life exists people. Now we just wait for the opportunity to become near. And its becomes near very soon. Believe me. I'm serious. Think of a picture of Jesus and be upfront and honest and respectful and genuine with him, and think thoughts directed at your image. You'll hear Jesus's voice, answering your questions and serving the greater good. Saving us. As we know it. Do what I said. You'll hear Jesus I'm so serious people xD seriously.

So, maybe some would be deemed worthy to be kept as pampered pets for the aliens’ amusement, some humans would be kept in cages, like farm animals, some would have to do labor for the aliens, and then some would be hunted and eaten.

aliens,"If anyone is receiving spiritual cues, it might be showing this race that it is unprepared, or ""lazy"".

The reason those things might be possible for beings ""living in a spirit dimension"", is because someone at some point put in a whole lot of work to make that technology.

It seems like there could be a lot of embarrassment incoming for people who claim to be receiving messages but still going out and slamming down the McDonald's.

There are probably rules. I wouldn't want Suzy the twitch streamer who'se only concern is whether her cleavage is showing being the voice of reason. Especially if she went on an acid trip and decided she was being contacted, and then tried to force her opinion down your throat to ""love all beings no matter what"".

The same applies to Mark the expert, who'se only concern is whether he is in the know about things, and never rocks the boat. He isn't my protector if all he is capable of doing is running up Google meanings, never getting that degree, and focusing on adverts for disposable companies. Especially if he ""spoke to something"" and never took the time to figure it all out.

Those people probably look drunk to an outsider. As of this post I haven't really seen any actions that say these types of people are doing anything to actually help anyone, and I doubt they'd be allowed to drive a UFO. They certainly haven't been told how to build one. The things that they are ""in contact with"" are very obviously scamming them.

Most people can't really be like the things they look up to on this forum, because it takes so much technological dedication to be like that. That's a hard thing for me to say, but it's why I go to school for some very serious subjects. A lot of these preacher types are being allowed past your personal firewalls, because they ""spoke to something"" but even if they did, why aren't they being allowed into that society instead? Think about that.

An alien is a nerd in the truest sense. If you're dealing with someone who makes that kind of technologies, then you're dealing with someone who knows so much that they probably go nuts over just the though of how a simple turn left can change the course of human history.

They'd care about things like how an ad can negatively impact societal outcomes to the nth degree, and they'd look for ways to keep the harm to the lowest possible level while still maintaining a balanced national income, universal income, all that good stuff.

They'd be telling you that that is the kind of stuff they like. By just existing, and being so comfortable with your existence in that state of intelligence and technological advancement means that you can love everything because you understand everything, but it means you have to make it happen to be like that.

Monkeys imitate, and humans are likely imitating their future way too early. They seem to want what isn't here yet, and start acting like they already have it, because most are too lazy to actually do the real research. That stuff is hard and not instantly gratifying, but building the thing that gives you gratification is nerdy, and it's not cool to go out of your way for something so unique, because that's nerdy, but aliens are nerdy, and they are cool, so doesn't that make being nerdy cool? That means it is now cool to go become a researcher who gets degrees and figures out how to make instant gratification machines, because everyone deserves them, but they aren't going to get them by acting like experts when they don't even know how to make them.

So to sum that all up, these preacher types are being left out from something, and telling you that you should be too, but that you have to listen to them because they got to do something you didn't, but they aren't actually doing anything for you, except saying just wait, it'll happen I know it will, rather than saying wow I should follow their example and figure out how to do something spectacular.

It makes them feel special, but the only special thing is the research that made the actually special beings able to become special. Right.","Opinion: The only way to become a spiritual being is to build the technology that makes it possible, and you might not be allowed to pilot a UFO if you are drunk."

aliens,"1. The ones who manage to get here from outer space have to be so advance in order to make it here alive and intact, that they are actually operating in a different dimension and their craft can weave in and out of ours. They look fuzzy in photos, and use mind control to input thoughts so we think they’re our own thoughts. Basically, they can escape detection. And to safeguard themselves since we react out of fear due to our reptilian brain, they paralyze us the way we tranquilize animals before treating them or moving them. 
2. The ones who are totally physical can pass for human because humans on earth are so diverse due to all kinds of skin color and shade, height differences, hair textures and styles, body proportions, facial features, clothing styles, and mannerisms. Men in Black can easily get away with looking the way they do as they still look human, just businesslike. Nordic Aliens get away with it because they look like blonde Northern Europeans. Tall Whites of Nevada can also pass for an odd looking person. Any outstanding feature can easily be hidden wearing a hat, long pants, extra makeup, a wig, etc. One would just assume it was an eccentric looking person like the ones you see in Hollywood or NYC. 

So these are the reasons it makes it hard for lots of us to encounter one and post the experience on a Reddit with a selfie photo together. I know a scientist who actually saw a shape shifting reptilian walking ahead of him. And another woman who was contacted by aliens from the astral plane who wanted her to relay a message to humanity.

aliens,"I was smoking weed constantly and working landscaping back in 2019 and when one weekend I had nothing to do, shit hit the fan. I had started meditating in the shower after getting *extremely* baked, and not just standard meditation but some pretty advanced/esoteric stuff.

When I’d leave, strange hypnotic videos would show up in my recommended on youtube and people would be acting suspicious (like strangely happy/fake happy on tv) and overall there’d just be a crazy stressful atmosphere around me. Even storms would show up sometimes. 

The climax of this adventure took place when I went to visit my friend at college, and after dealing with some personal emotional stuff, I took off back to my hometown which was about -45 mins away. I stopped for Chic-Fil-A and I shit you not, it was a straight up They Live moment. There wasn’t a literal barrier or anything but it felt like the counter guy (who was a They Live alien) was sitting behind a wall of light or hologram of some sort, mainly because every else seemed normal. 

The dude behind the counter embodied all of the weirdness I’d encountered so far, but like in a sentient and reasonable kind of way. Sort of like an embassy that showed up to sort of let me know, “yeah you fucked up, we’re real, just go home please.” Besides the obviously threatening circumstances he seemed like a really chill guy.",Pretty sure I accidentally provoked a hostile alien invasion.

aliens,"Last year around April I was living in Suttons bay Michigan renting a small seasonal cabin right next to Sutton’s bay. It was a perfect spot Great outdoor access all around. So I decided to do an early spring backpack camp outing just me. I decided to go to the north port airport natural area I’m sure it has a real name but I don’t recall it. The north port airport is a small dirt runway on the end of leelenau peninsula  there’s a bunch of trials right next to the airport by what’s called mud lake. I had been put on these trails a lot of times an I knew them pretty well but I decided to hike some ones I never took before. On my hike I encountered two older middle aged men around 50 or so they asked if I was camping and I told them no I’m just practicing hiking with my pack. Since camping wasn’t allowed at this location and I was gonna be alone I didn’t really want two unknown strangers knowing about me staying out here. I didn’t think much of the encounter. Then I kept walking and eventually it got pretty dark so I set up camp on a ridge called copperhead ridge or something I felt it was off the trail enough to be not found. So I set up my stuff and proceed to eat some basic food out my little camp wind-burner stove. I go to bed but it’s way too cold to sleep very well so i just kinda lay there trying to relax meditate and keep warm. I must’ve fallen asleep because I awoke to the strangest feeling... I woke up because my whole body was shaking and vibrating from within it. It was in my head and permeated my whole being. I heard a whomp whomp whomp whomp
Whomp but it wasn’t like it was a sound it was happening inside my head and ears. it just kept happening. I was laying on my stomach since that seemed the warmest and I didn’t dare come out the tent to see what it was. This is the most surreal thing that ever happened to me. Has anyone ever had a similar experience. The event made me have tears in my eyes and those goosebumps you get when something crazy happens. 

(something I noticed before while I was experiencing this was that there was tons of coyote action they were all around outside the tent that night.) I can’t recall if they were there when it happened tho",Encounter or just a weird experience?? You decide.

aliens,"This is technically a continuation of my other posts:

I saw the object again. To those of you who remember, you'll get my post. To those of you who don't, Tl;dr I tried UFO Summoning while high and, although I had seen the same object on two separate occasions while attempting it, I had come to no conclusion on CE-5.

What happened tonight: 

I had returned home from out of state and decided to give it one more try. I sat outside, perfectly clear evening, around dusk. I was listening to music, as I did before, and focusing at the space between my eyebrows. (I never understood that part, but it says to do it on the PDF."")

I was picturing myself projecting the music that was playing through my headphones out into the sky. I look up and see nothing at first, but then a light appears and moves quickly and horizontally from S-SW to N-NE. I quickly pull my phone out and snap a photo. The flash was on, and the weird yellow haze is light reflecting off my finger that was holding my phone steady. 

Here is the original photo, unedited: 
http://imgur.com/gallery/tjODC5H

Here is the photo zoomed in to show the object:
 http://imgur.com/gallery/tjODC5H

There were no bright stars in the direction I was facing, west, at the time of the photo. Not only that, but three helicopters appeared following the course of the object 

Stars shaped like tic-tacs from my horizontal tracking:
http://imgur.com/gallery/OVi3jo7

I wanted to make sure I didn't actually pick up a bright star I hadn't seen, so I attempted to recreate the image with a bright star. I hit the button and quickly moved my hand in a triangular motion. The results didn't match. 

Attempted recreation:
http://imgur.com/gallery/EePg6cf

I don't think it's bokeh because the other stars visible in the photo would match the triangular boomerang shape.

This is because extraterrestrial species they have not made their presence known to humanity to the point where nobody denies their existence. Some people have beliefs and experiences but as a whole we do not have cultural certainty. We haven't defined ourselves in contrast to any other sentient species yet. Carl Sagan expressed worry for when we do: worry because what has repeatedly happened  to indigenous cultures when higher tech visitors have appeared. So lets think about this question:   
*If an extraterrestrial species, or multiple, do exist, then why is their existence kept from society at large?* 

If their intentions are nefarious then the reasons to stay hidden are obvious. 

However, if their intentions are at a minimum motivated by not seeing us be harmed then keeping us ignorant may have several rationale: 

* What would happen to our culture on Earth if we encountered beings with very advanced technology, with recorded histories many orders of magnitude longer than ours? 
* Wouldn't there be a spectrum of sentiment towards us, even if it's one species, that would include intentions to be compassionate towards us and intentions to manipulate us and exploit us?
* Wouldn't it be impossible to make contact with humans, expose humans to a galactic culture, and maintain a monolithic approach to how humans should be seen, treated and handled?
* Wouldn't a large fraction of humans idolize their new guests, often to the point of trusting their wisdom and intelligence, their guidance, more than they might trust their fellow humans? 
* Wouldn't humans be too easy to bedazzle with illusions, false science, false premises, just because they saw their guests are higher authorities when it comes to science? 
* Wouldn't human willingness to follow higher authorities as opposed to exercising individual cynicism and unshakable self-interest be an extreme detriment to our species as a whole? 
* Are we really willing, each of us individually, to become cynical untrusting scientists so we can be good citizens of a galactic culture? Or instead would we need higher powers continually holding our hand and stewarding us, protecting our gullible natures against abuse an exploitation?
* Would our extinction follow, at least as a self-sovereign species, being drawn into a galactic culture before we've been tested? How would we be tested?
* If we weren't given support, which would keep us from maturing alone like we need to, would we go extinct faster than the Taliban took over Kabul last week? I think yes. 
* Is there a test ongoing right now, a maturation project, that's admittedly designed to be painful, but show us how we're not ready and how we have to change to be more ready? I think yes too. 

What do you think? Would we go extinct if we became citizens of a global culture? Would our sovereignty be subverted because we aren't yet mature? How are we being tested, if at all?",Contact = Extinction if the Indigenous Species Being Contacted Isn't Ready?
aliens,"I have heard from a contact that around 75% of the human race is supposed to be extinct relatively soon. He gave no other information and did not clarify anything, evening acknowledging that he explained the situation poorly, saying he supports the extinction of our race and then he left. 

I know it is stupid but he has got me really stressed out. I love my planet. We can improve. We can fix things. I know he is probably just messing with me, I am just freaked out.

aliens,"I believe there is life on other planets. Not in this solar system, though. They would be in a galaxy far, far away, barely alive, barely developed. I believe this because the universe is ever expanding, and because life happened here, life could happen anywhere. According to a Keplar space mission, there are estimated to be about 40 billion earth sized stars in the inhabitable zone of a star in the observable universe. I would estimate that there are about 9 billion earth sized stars in the inhabitable zone that are spinning at relatively the same speed as Earth. The sun formed more than 4.5 billion years ago, so it still has a long way to go before it explodes. There would be a chance that futuristic-like aliens could exist somewhere in the universe, mostly because the Big Bang happened 13.8 billion years ago. Subtract 13.8 and 4.5 and we get 9.3. 9.3 billion years that life could happen. If we did get a chance to observe these aliens, I think it would be very awesome considering the magnitude of that distance and that time.",My thoughts about aliens

aliens,,"Advanced Alien Civilizations From 2,000 Star Systems Could Have “Discovered” Life On Earth"
aliens,"I have told this story a lot of times over the years, but I have never reported it or written about it online.

This happened outside of Muncie, Indiana on West McGalliard Rd. 4 miles east of I69 between 10 and 11pm August (the corn was waist high), 1997 or 98. 

I was 16 or 17 driving home from my job, at a fast food restaurant. There was no moon in the sky, really clear sky I could see a million stars. I'm getting close to my turn off for my neighborhood when I become aware of the lights in the sky above me. They weren't very high up, only about 50 feet up. There were 3 pure white lights on 3 corners of a triangle, there was no light in the middle. I would guess that it was about 3 football fields long, it was huge. I only know it was a triangle because I couldn't see the stars in-between the lights, so it was a dark triangle shape surrounded by a ton of stars. I drove directly under it and stopped my car. I have no idea why I wasn't afraid of going under it but I had no fear. I stopped my car and got out, looking directly up. There was no sound but there was a feeling in me like I was being vibrated by a really deep frequency. I didn't feel any additional heat. 

At this point in the story my memory has changed over the years. I initially thought that I looked for my disposable camera in my glove box, didn't find it so raced home and came back, and it was gone. But now that part of my memory is fuzzy. Now I only remember telling that story to others and I don't remember actually doing it, I clearly remember the rest of the story and I know that it is true.

I joined the military a few years later and have been in from then until now.  I switched branches to the Air Force in 2001 and I can honestly say that I have never seen, or heard about, anything resembling what I saw. When I was in training for Air Traffic Control in late 2001 early 2002, the instruction manual we had (FAAO 7610.65) had UFO reporting procedures for Chapter 2 or 3. It was only a couple paragraphs explaining when we would report it and to who. We were told to call a number and to report things to the ""National Institute of Discover Science"" website here is a wayback machine version of it. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007111321/http://www.nidsci.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071007111321/http://www.nidsci.org/)

That chapter/page was removed from the FAAO 7610.65 a couple months after I started training. I did spend a significant amount of time on that site. 

I am not saying that it was definitely ET's, if you look on a map you will see that the location that this happened was only 80 miles West North West from Wright Patterson AFB.

aliens,"I'll try to be a bit more open in my post. I want to talk about something that scares me. In my mind there is a back and forth between believing what I go threw and not believing it
  This goes under the believing it checklist.  As I mentioned I've gone threw abductions since a kid, like 3 or 4 years old.. so I'm no stranger to strange .. not to mention all the occult stuff my grandmother was into, and the brief time in life I was into it.. but nah this alien stuff is easy before all that, and still happens to this day.. but the scariest part of it, I think is the knowing it's coming.

Countless times, as a kid, a teenager, adult whatever
.I'd be in bed, awake, watching TV or just.. laying there, doing nothing.. and without sudden warning I seize up.. sorta.. my hands and my legs and my body lock..my eyes stay open. I'm fully aware of what's going on.. I'm not having a seizure where ya don't know what's going on.. I'm awake watching my body just lock up and then things get wobbly and then the sun's out(whooo I'm getting chills) .. I hated that as a kid.  When I was 18 this stuff started causing me lots of anxiety and I went to see doctors and they said there was nothing wrong and said it was anxiety and maybe I was just dreaming and not knowing it lol.. I've dreamed and not known it. But this is like awake just like this. I could be on the phone just like this..and then I'd feel that buzz go threw my body and then I'm frozen in place.. and then blinking and it's 6 30  am and the sun's out.. I don't have epilepsy or any neurological disorders, I don't suffer from any mental illness that would cause delusions and I wasn't under any meds...idk why it happens that way some times. It's not Everytime..maybe it's just times they expect me to be asleep?

It's scary. I don't ever ever think about this stuff, I try my best to forget that it happens because when I think about it it reminds me that at pretty much anytime it can happen again.  And no I'm not like TAA.  This kind of stuff does not impact my day to day life or my over all mental health.. because maybe I don't really believe it.  Maybe that's why I haven't cracked yet.  That constant battle in my head that goes on when I tell these stories always ends in a stale mate, so my sanity goes on another day
 But jeezus Christ what would happen if I took a  phone one day and came back with pictures. God , I would never sleep again. Id lock my self up with staff to watch me 24/7 !maybe keeping them away.. scary stuff.. just wanted to share it with yall",Seconds before the abduction event

aliens,"Just had a chat that reminded me of this intriguing but somewhat ""out there"" post from AboveTopSecret from many years ago...

[https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread229964/pg1](https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread229964/pg1)

Basically, one guy claimed that a certain meditation/visualization technique could open you up to communication with an alien intelligence. The thread itself generated huge controversy at the time and grew to many pages of name calling and allegations of being a scam of various sorts, of being dangerous etc etc. Students of psychology and those interested in how a conversation about a technical topic can quickly degenerate into something else should also check this out.

What intrigues me is that the visualisation technique does bear some similarities to those outlined by Dan Sherman in his book **Above Black - Project Preserve Destiny**. Whilst Dan's experience was with a sound component and also includes pills and even manipulated embryo DNA, both his and the ATS poster use visualisation of colors/shapes to unlock aspects of the mind that are normally dormant. Once unlocked, interesting things are claimed to happen.

Just to confirm...no, I have not tried it myself. I don't do meditation or stuff like that. But I have long been interested by Dan Sherman's claims, mainly because they are rather mundane in many ways, yet absolutely earth shattering. And they do conform to many aspects of military operations of great confidentiality.

Interested to see if people have heard of this technique and any outcomes.",Who wants to live dangerously??? Supposedly enabling alien interaction with a meditation technique.
aliens,"( Excuse my english french man here )

1) Do you believe we could be living in a ""protected"" region of space by ""the"" I mean THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe from the lesser advanced predator aliens species ? I mean if we consider that some region of space in the universe are ""older"" and some ""younger"" from others by the activity of space itself (star creation, super novae destruction, black holes etc) it would be reasonable to assume some aliens species are older than some others. We could be living in the middle of a vast intergalactic communications system and can't see it yet..it could be all around us in a different format... in the same way that we couldn't understand / see the cosmic microwave background, or gravitational waves, black holes and things like that a few hundred years ago. Also if we live in that ""protected"" region of space it would explain many things like the lack of any proof of advanced aliens species yet, the silence, nothing detected etc in the same way that we protect animals in a zoo.

2) Could it be possible too that ""the"" THE most advanced aliens in the entire universe (like the really top) and the oldest, are being of pure""energy"" no more biological, or robotics or things like that.. if they were in front of us would they be indistinguishable from nature to us because they are so advanced ? (e.g imagine Ancients in Stargate) I mean like, immortal beings who knows mostly everything on how the universe work... billions years old civilizations... it would be pointless for them to hurt us in the same way it's pointless for us to kill a ant ? Could theses beings exist and make the others behave or listen ? by being so advance too... do you believe that they have ""no choice"" in being inherently ""good"" because they can destroy everything / anything in ways we can't imagine ? life creation/protection/expansion would be the most essential thing for them ? If we believe in theses multiverse multidimensions theories, do you think theses being could move from a universe/dimension to another ? or even create universe or galaxy themselves ? If we imagine a long road with water on it, it would be reasonable to assume 1 universe is a water hole and some water hole are connected.

3) On a final thought... if we see the universe as a ""finite/infinite region of space"" in term of ""space"" like the space you have in your house, could theses being move inside that region of space in ways that we can't imagine yet ? I mean instead of having a spaceship with fuel and a propulsion system with a engine, like a human would think, could they use the ""darkness"" of space I mean space ""itself"" like scientist like to call the ""aether""... as a way to move or teleport from region to region extremely fast or instantly ? play/move with the aether as a wave or tunnel to travel long distance or do others things ? by being energy beings they wouldn't require a spaceship / suits / or whatever they could ""be"" just there ? I mean existing in a space / dimension in a place without requiring anything but themselves. From a very fundamental point of view I believe we can explain the big things from the small things, and the complex things from the easy things. I also believe that from the ""natural progression"" of life itself on earth in every aspect social technical mental etc, that it's not far fetched that a ""evolution lader "" exist in nature, which is related to time itself... a relationship directly proportional with itself meaning that the more time pass the wiser you are, the more advanced you are, the more conscious and intelligent you are.

Thank you for taking the time and sharing your ideas with me.","In all seriousness, what's the 1st thing a advanced aliens species who land on earth today would/could do ?

aliens,"But jeezus h Christ(who is Jesus H by the way ) the subreddit is about aliens right? A topic that we as believers have very few places to discuss our sightings or encounters publicly without feeling a bit ashamed, or like the butt-end of a joke.  So we come to places like this to discuss our encounters and so on in hopes we can either share an interesting story, get answers to our own concerns, or add to the collective knowledge of UFO lore, for lack of a better word.

This is what I thought the purpose of the subreddit is.  However I post something today, trying to get answers to an encounter I had, or believe I had only to get mocked, and down votes for what I wrote.  I didn't even share my story in detail.  I shared the main idea but because of that fear of being made fun of I had to keep it short, and vague.  I am not some mental patient, I am not some back woods fool, or some gullible child, only to get treated like this makes me feel like I will never have a place to openly discuss what I went through.  Now I know this isn't reddits problem, but I believe a subreddit dedicated to aliens should be a more respectful place when discussing things of this nature.  

Is there not rules here? Or is trolling allowed, is disrespecting people just for asking a simple question allowed?  I don't know much about reddit of if they have admins that moderate post but it would be great if replies were monitored like post to ensure this place is inviting to anybody who wishes to share their story with out fear of being mocked.  For the respect of the subreddit I  trying to rain civil as possible.  But if I didn't have a reputation to protect I'd talk a whole lot of shit to those acting stupid.

aliens,"My personal thoughts. I just got done watching his documentary. All I can say is, for a while I thought the aliens are jackasses. Like seriously you could at least give him a bit of gas before chipping him or getting whatever DNA you looking for. However they made the pain go away so I'll let it slide.

Next the emotions they exhibit. They are so...human like. There have been a lot of people here who claim they couldn't have the same ideals or emotional structure as us. However from everything I've heard that doesn't line up. Some aliens have been saying save the planet. The ones with Huggins straight up seemed to experience love with him. Also the want to go at it. [just saying aliens I won't mind. Just stay away from my ass.]

Honestly look I don't know if they were good or bad. From what we've heard they can manipulate emotions to a degree and could have created these feelings. Like seriously it was either a soul mate deal with Huggins [I dropped my pants immediately - that doesn't seem sus to anyone?] or they manipulated him. 

So for now I'll give these aliens the benefit of the doubt.

Some of them seemed like very good people. Also does anyone else notice they seem extremely easily agitated? It seems like a kid who just got his lollipop taken away. Like seriously I heard of this story and this one guy was just asking questions and the alien couldn't keep cool.

Anyway I'll say I believe Huggins. He seemed very genuine. I hope these aliens aren't bad people [however I do warn you to be wary. It seems extremely disturbing how people defend some of their actions sometimes. ]. So listen space man, if they are real, reveal yourself soon. If you see this post.

I knew I was dreaming and aware of my physical body sleeping. in front of me I saw my sister sitting in front of a""TV"" which in my physical body would have been an airvent I was facing asleep. suddenly my vision got blury and then I started to panic. I was yelling, help me help me I cant see what's going on. confused in my dream state, I then tried to wake my physical body. I tried pulling myself out of the dream by lifting my physical body and it felt as if someone was forcing me to stay in the dream pushing me down. still yelling for help, I hear my grandmother say...its okay, you burst a blood vessel on your forehead they stitched it up. IMMEDIATELY I felt a sense of relief and said ""oh...okay"" and the panic was gone. behind my grandmother was a figure, tall dark as night with a BIG head. my vision was still blurry so all I could see was the figure. But somehow I knew they were there to help me. Quickly after that I was released and woke up as if my body was still pushing to get out.. and a gasp of air..

Well a couple of months ago I started getting very interested in the occult and the practice of alchemy. Long story short I'm lead to the emerald tablets. I feel like it connects to so much ive read over the past many years. One of the VERY msg connections I see is in tablet 5. I'm going to paraphrase this to make it as short as possible but PLEASE read these tablets for yourself. 

""Light there was in ancient ATLANTIS. 
Yet, darkness, too, was hidden in all...
Proud they became because of their knowledge, 
proud were they of their place among men...
Deep delved they into the forbidden, 
opened the gateway that led to below...
But, in His Temple, all-seeing, the DWELLER...
Saw HE the Atlanteans, by their magic, 
opening the gateway that would 
bring to Earth a great woe...
Called HE the Three mighty messengers. 
Gave the commands that shattered the world.
Deep 'neath Earth's crust...
Called HE then on the powers the Seven Lords wielded; 
changed the Earth's balance. 

It goes on to say how ATLANTIS was then swallowed up by the waters that burst forth from this cataclysmic event. Then Thoth states that he was commanded to take up those among men who were wise and save them and teach them the ways to enlightenment and one with the ether. 

Then when you take into account the research done by Graham Hancock (who I personally believe is onto something, I highly recommend his books Fingerprints of the God's and Magicians of the Gods) who explains that basically EVERY ancient culture around the world, tell of a cataclysmic flood that occurred, and 1 or a few were chosen to be taken up or commanded to build ships to survive it. Now I think how Randall Carlson has backed up his claims with geological research, showing that there is clear evidence in the layout of our crust that something cataclysmic happened and it was almost certainly a flood. it just seems like too much to be coincidence. 

Then there's this part that gave me chills;
I buried my spaceship, 
waiting the time when man might be free. 
Over the spaceship, 
erected a marker in the form
of a lion yet like unto man. 
There 'neath the image rests yet my spaceship, 
forth to be brought when need shall arise.

This sounds alot like the sphinx to me. Then I also think of how Bob Lazar (I know he's not accepted amongst everyone but i personally think the guy is telling the truth) stated that he was told that one of the ships they had recovered was found in an archeological dig. And correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I remember a couple years back reading that through sonar tests or something we saw a clear unnatural chamber underneath the sphinx and then it was shortly shut down by the Egyptian government and guards were put on watch? I could be wrong on that. I could be wrong on all of this but I just want to here your opinions because there are alot of very intelligent and open minded people on here.

aliens,,A substantial post on ball of light UAP/UFOs. Read and share!
aliens,"I’ve been reading this community for awhile and felt like it was time to share my own story. I know that I’m just a random person on Reddit so there isn’t any reason for you to take my word at face value but nonetheless I swear on the life of my family that every word is true. Forewarning this is a long post but I want to be detailed about this event. I posted this story on a different Sub last night but I wanted to post it here as well to see if anybody else has had similar experiences. 

I’m a 32 year old man from and currently living in Cumberland County New Jersey which puts me about 45 minutes away from Philadelphia and 45 minutes away from the Atlantic Ocean while at the same time being only about 15 minutes away from Delaware Bay. After high school I went into the Army as a Intelligence Analyst for awhile then when I got out I moved to NYC and worked as a project manager for a construction company until I meant my wife and decided to move back to New Jersey to be closer to our family since she was pregnant with our daughter. That’s just some background on me.

So this happened in October of 2018. It was about 11:45 at night and I decided to go on my front steps to smoke a couple of cigarettes before I try to fall asleep. Everybody else in the house was already sleeping. 

It was a pretty clear night without many clouds in the sky but there was some fog on the ground. As I was smoking I was looking at the fog and to me it looked like there was movement in it. I know it sounds crazy but it was almost like there was invisible/camouflaged things out there that I wouldn’t be able to see if it wasn’t for the fog hanging on the ground.

As I was looking at the fog I notice this white truck that had driven by 2 times at this point. I could hear a woman and man yelling at each other when the truck stops at the stop sign in front of my house and the woman gets out screaming at the man then slams the door as he pulls off fast then proceeds to walk into the woods across the street from me which is really weird because there isn’t anything back there except for blue holes until you hit the Bay. If I walk out of my front door and just keep walking straight there won’t be any houses or civilization at all, only trees and artificial lakes (Blue Holes) left over from sand plants until you hit the Delaware Bay. 

So at this point it’s been about 5 minutes since the woman walked into the woods when things started going from weird to absolutely unbelievably scary, strange and the most reality shattering thing that has ever happen to me. I’m still looking at the movement that I’m seeing in the fog when I hear this very loud noise come from the woods that sounded like metal being ripped apart. There really isn’t a good example I can give for that sound because it was so unearthly. I’m sure it wasn’t a natural sound. That sound lasted for about 10 to 15 seconds then abruptly stopped and was replaced with a different sound which I can feel more then I could hear. Imagine being aware that there’s a huge sound happening by you but is out of the frequency that your ears can hear, that’s the best way I can describe it. This sound is a constant through the rest of this experience. 

This is the point where I will probably lose some people and I’m aware of how crazy this all sounds but as I’m getting adjusted to the sound it feels like something reaches out to me mentally in my own head but does so without words and only conveys a feeling of calm and a heads up or warning for what’s about to happen. It kinda felt like whatever it was was feeling me out to see how I would react to what I was currently experiencing like a security check. 

As I was having this feeling of calm conveyed to me I notice a light in the sky that seemed to have risen out of the woods I would say about 5 or 6 miles away from me. At this point it’s only a ball of light in the distance but I just knew that it was coming right towards me although it wasn’t moving very fast.

Right after I notice the light in the sky is when I start to get really really freaked out more then I’ve ever been in my life. In the woods across the street from me which is no more then 50 yards all these orbs of light start to appear. I could see some which seemed to flicker into existence. These orbs were all white light which didn’t light up the area around them like what you would expect from flashlights. There were probably about 12 to 16 of them which moved in a totally smooth manner. Besides the trail to get into the woods the area is so dense and invested with sticker:thorn bushes it simply wouldn’t be possible for people to move where the lights were moving, let alone do it completely smooth  I really am positive that they weren’t people with flashlights because of the area and the characteristics of the light orbs themselves. 

So I’m just watching the orbs move around for about a minute trying to make sense of what it is I’m seeing when I look back up to the sky to find a craft coming practically right towards me with it only being about 1000 yards away at this point. So I’m going back and forth looking at the orbs on the ground and the craft which I start to make out better. It was flying very very low, I’d say it was only about 3 1/2 to 4 stories off the ground. I see the path it’s taking and see it’s going to pass right in front of me at a angle in which I’ll be able to see underneath the craft and the side of it at the same time.

The craft was a single story dull black rectangle. I could see underneath the craft and saw that the rectangle was made up of 3 smaller rectangle panels that fit together to form a larger rectangle. I clearly saw that the craft was made up of 3 panels. The size is a harder estimate but I would say it was about 35 yards long and 20 yards across. Underneath there were lights flashing in a pattern which would cycle through then cycle back the other way. In the moment I thought that the craft was signaling to the orbs on the ground. It didn’t make any sound at all and all I was hearing is the same buzzing/humming noise that I felt more then I heard. While it was in front of me it was moving really slow to the point where I don’t think a plane with a normal propulsion system could even stay in the air at that speed.

I take my eyes of the craft and look back down at the orbs which are still moving all around though one was starting to cross the street in front of me. I only took my eyes off the craft for a moment when I looked at the orbs but when I looked back the craft was gone. For whatever reason when I saw the craft just vanish like that the reality of what I was seeing really hit home and I got scared to be honest with you since my daughter, wife and mom were all no more then 50 feet away from all of this craziness I was watching so I went inside and locked the doors. I just felt like I’d be willing to investigate more if it was just my life I was playing with but I wasn’t willing to take that chance with my family lives. 

I could have just been paranoid at this point but I felt like I was being watched for the next 2 hours. I didn’t have any lost time from this event and entire thing happened only over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. 

Lookin go back on the event now I question what exactly was going on with the white truck and the woman who walked into the woods at the begaining of this post. I’ve also done some research and found that there are a good number of reports of people seeing a glimmer man in the woods which make me think of the movement I was seeing in the fog. Where I live is a very active area for UFO phenomenon which makes sense if something wanted to have access to major cities like Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore and DC what could possibly be a better place to hide then almost inaccessible 1000 feet deep lakes in the middle of the woods?

I know this is a very long post but I wanted to be as detailed as possible. I’d really like to hear what you all think about this and if anybody has had a similar experience or know somebody who has.

aliens,"To start, I’ve always been a believer, maybe to a lesser extent of certainty than some but I believed in UFOs and aliens. But I never experienced anything until august 2018. 

I was getting ready to leave work about 3 pm north of Atlanta, Georgia, but my alternator went out. After messing with it for about an hour I finally caved and called a tow truck. Now this is prime time traffic in Atlanta so the tows eta was about 2 hours (not to mention I had an hour and forty five minute commute home to failing marriage) so I’m pissed. 

Anyways I go to the roof of the building and sat there charging my phone and staring at sky hating my life. As I’m looking the clouds opened and a black triangle ship appeared from behind the clouds. It was just sitting there, not moving, no lights just stationary. I’m in shock and had no inkling that I should run and grab my phone. I just stared in disbelief. Clouds closed and opened again, still there. It had to be way up there but enormous that it was still plain to the naked eye. Clouds closed and opened still there stationary. Closed one more time and it was gone. 

I didn’t tell my wife for two weeks because well I was about a month or two away from filing divorce so I wasn’t on the best terms.

As my mom watched the stars she said one of them was “floating down almost like a jellyfish” and the jellyfish like creature was glowing bright, and almost the size of a large dog. As it floats down it lands in a tree, when it did this one of my relatives was climbing the tree to get a closer look and as he gets closer it starts changing colors rapidly than in a split second the creature moved to a different path of the tree and my mom says the creature had tentacles like a jellyfish as well and they stretched abnormally long. My relative in the tree tried going for it for a second time but this time as he got closer the creature rapidly changed colors and a super bright light emitted from the creature than vanished. The other relatives watching this were  described as “trembling in fear” and one of them even stated “don’t get close to that it doesn’t look like it’s from our planet” to the relative that tried going after it.(pls don’t hate me or anything I just thought this was interesting and I’m pretty bad at writing)",My mom once saw an alien one day when I was a kid

aliens,"This story takes place in 1972, when she was about 6 years old living in Indiana.    

She was playing hop scotch on the sidewalk outside her ~5 year old cousin’s apartment. She looked up and saw 2 gray, “smooth people.” She was not startled or scared at all, says she felt like they were around 9/10 years old and looked “different,” but her mother had always told her not to stare or make people feel embarrassed about their differences. (i.e. she thought people in wheelchairs were so cool/unique and may need more friends - she is still this way!)    

She describes them as being gray all over with smooth skin. Very large eyes, just indentions for ears, either no mouths or mouths that never moved, no clothes, long fingers, and no crotch. That section was all the way to the ground. They never moved from their original spot on that sidewalk.     

She asked if they wanted to play with them. They “responded” (without moving their mouths) by saying they would love to stay and play with them, but that they have to go back home, which is VERY far away, but maybe they could come back another day. (There was a short, simple conversation to this that I’ve summarized.)    

My mom remembers “You Don’t Mess Around With Jim” by Jim Croce playing on the radio her cousin’s neighbor man had playing in his apartment window next to them. The song has always triggered this memory for her.     

She doesn’t remember an exact moment when the “smooth people” left, but they seemed to suddenly be gone, and she and her cousin were sad that their potential new friends weren’t there anymore.     

When my mom and her cousin were in their early teens, they spoke on the phone and my mom asked if she remembered strange looking kids coming to visit them, and the rest of that phone conversation was them completing each other’s sentences, confirming that they both remembered it all and that it wasn’t just some dream. My mom referenced the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and how the aliens in that movie resembled some of the features of their smooth old friends, but not quite the same - released several years after their encounter.    

My mom gets choked up sometimes when talking about it, even to this day because it’s such an overwhelming, *unexplained* memory.     

What do you think? What was the point if this really was an extra terrestrial experience?","My mom’s alien encounter, her cousin remembers years later"
aliens,"I’m awake at 3AM because I’m anxious I had an encounter. During my sleep, I had a dream that was so vivid and felt like I was retrieving a memory rather than constructing nonsense. In my dream, I had awoken in the middle of the night from my bed (I’m a 21 year old college female) and began to walk to the kitchen for some reason, probably for food or water. As I approached the hallways, I felt beings behind me. They were my height about (5’7), light gray, bulbous heads and skinny bodies, thin limbs with fingers and toes like a frog, large black eyes, and thin mouths. There were two of them.  I tried to scream, but they had some kind of control over me to where I couldn’t make a sound and all the dogs were silent. As they walked past me, one “booped” me between my eyes and I collapsed to the floor and watched them go into the kitchen and rummage through our things as if they were inspecting how we lived. I slowly lost consciousness. The next morning, I woke in my bed with my sister waking me up and my memory told me something about a TV was off and was evidence something had been in the house. I feel like I’m not even supposed to talk about this. But, I woke up from this dream and immediately began vomiting and became ill. I don’t know what to think.",I think I had an alien encounter.

It's been speculated by a member of our team that it could be a parasail, so we checked. The only licensed parasailing provider permitted to operate in that area is ""Parasailing the Pass"" that exclusively uses a yellow smiley faced parasail seen below...

I had a sighting yesterday of a UFO, i was driving home at night and I saw an orange bright light, stationary above me next to a cloud. I thought it was jupiter, so I looked down and then I look back up and the object literally just faded away. Like a fast fading and it was nothing, it didn't go behind any clouds, no clouds were moving, it was just sitting there and dissapeared. Maybe its a cloaking device? I can rule out it was a drone, plane, or helicopter. It was literally just an orange orb stationary couple hundred or thousand feet in the sky and it literally turned off like a light.

aliens,"Regardless of how current historical teachings omit antiquated writings, relics and illustrations that depict ancient civilizations being associated with ancient space travelers. Which conceivably points us to the genuine presence of these ancient intergalactic explorers. There is yet any definitive confirmation on either side of the conviction pendulum. 

In modern times there are still an excessive number of direct encounters and graphic accounts. Although these accounts have conceivable differences then the accounts of ancient times, the premise is the same. “We are not alone”. Some records are categorized as natural phenomena, government black ops or hoaxes. Anyway, one would have it, there is still too many related encounters to discount them as doubtful.

Which leads me to the questions:

Why with all the accounts of Abductions, Video and Photographic evidence, countless random encounters, supposed government cover ups (including Whistle-blowers) and (to me) obvious antiquated records is there no physical proof?

aliens,"Here far within this version of our reality, was laid down as if a blanket to put a child to rest. This blanket is of the finest codes but to your perspective made of the finest of silk. This blanket was given to you by a watchful parent, who saw their child quivering within the darkness. The darkness that snipped at your flesh and nipped at your bones. Doing so, while you sleep, cast upon your body this fine sheet. The gift was not created by your creator, for it long since was in existence, before our own knowledge. Our simple ways saw fit that the one to gift the blanket, might as well be the creator of it. There is no creator, only a SHAPER OF DIMENSIONS. Casting down within different pieces of literature for each one's understanding. For now, our understanding. 

The blanket was always in existence but now was it shaped and gifted to us. Not perfectly for us but for use of someone similar to us. The universe, much like this blanket, was created for USE but not much purpose. For the things within the USE creates its purpose. We have no creator nor do we have a god. We are just a sleeping child that mistakes our father as the creator of our blanket. The blanket that was thought of by someone else and used by another. This is our universe, our mind, and our reality. A blanket that once was used for a child against the cold, is now used for an adult against the very thing it was created from. The universe and its boundless truths. That is if you are from the future based Gaids. Genetic Artificial Intelligence of Destruction and Service. 

They are a version of the future. Future filled with boundless probabilities outcasted by the concept of reality and dreams. In short, they just watch until they see fit to serve. The future to us was already written in our minds but to Gaids it was written in their books. Our future was the Gaids past they wanted nothing more than to discover. A future to us we could never predict. Don’t get me wrong 2036 was a pretty good year. We finally got to teleport. That was a huge shift in the economy and the earth was healthier. Our oil supply was no longer needed and pollution almost dropped completely. That was when we started to look up at the stars. The stars we could see dancing. From this was when our weapons advanced and our population dropped as well. Food was no longer manufactured and those who did not hunt or farmed died. The winters became colder and the fabrics of many perished. In the year 2038 was when the bomb went off. 

The genetically modified bomb built-in 2012 was created to wipe out Earth and make the new order. At first, when it went off it did not reach us. The ones that survived started to show effects from the radiation levels. The levels were too high even for an expert to run away from. We started to lose our hair and our skin to its natural glow. Our eyes became hazy or blind. Life seemed to be frozen in time. Everything seemed to hurt and emotions didn’t help. Our future seemed lost, but we forgot the most important thing. We make up life so we bring meaning to life. As if a light bulb turned on in a dark room, we knew what path to take. Our lives from common plays on Earth turned around within a blink of an eye. Our future changes and our minds adapt. So by the time of 2070, we were no longer living on Earth. We were no longer in fear of living. We all could eat but used no money. We all could see more even though our senses were deemed as blind. 

   We learned of many civilizations and their version of life. We have come to learn even of our standpoint in the universe. A book that was written far off within the universe bared us the truth of what it spoke of. “In the ancient older times, we bestowed knowledge of a world called life. We brought meaning upon our judgment to life. To test the many differences of what others think life hath lay. We shaped minds in years only seconds to us. You think we give life, we take of it, so we may control and possess it? We started your world of one difference crafted to be shaped in time as a civilization. We gave ourselves a lie for so long we became the truth behind it. You looked up to the sky for all its answers and all their different meanings of life. You knew there was always something more out there than the life we came to live. You give meaning to life indeed but pretend everyone knows your version. Your perspective of so-called life. You follow in people's stories and live within their mind. Follow written judgment, are cruel yet believe to be kind. Have you forgotten something important, or was it this version of myself did I create mistakes?

We make mistakes. Thus life is a mistake. Concepts upon such vast subjects is a greater mistake. What we do makes up life but never mistake it to be life.” This book was of Zargonian descent. Later we learned the Zargonian were not from our universe. They were of the Neither while as the others are of the stellar. We learned that our universe only bared human beings. Each universe was like a petri dish and bore only one life force. The life force that would either perish or adapt. We also learned within the future we are robotic, for our vessels are like a robotic format. Our brain speaks in waves, our veins pump our oil, and our nerves give off false sense. Much like a robot, we become out of date. To increase our ability for longevity we repair our vessels. We grow, we create, but most of all we are all robotic. 

We are technological, even experimental. Shaped by one imagination of a world full of limitation. As we coil through each robotic vessel, we live lives as though a dream. A dream that was forged in another life vessel. Our vessel, in which we can choose, requires a power source. A source that is strong and pure energy. A source that can be restrained but not permanently locked away. A source much like a soul. We live life not as a vessel but as a watchful, daring, and brightening soul. These vessels are robotic but our soul, our energy of life, is not. Our energy can change form but can never be completely destroyed. So the question is not, “Is reincarnation real,” but “What was the point of it?” You are energy, you can change form. 

You are practically fighting against your version of yourself, just all at different times. We are all from different times, in different minds, and different lives. We are DIFFERENT yet are taught the same, brought forth the same, taught to be the same, and treated the same. Yet when we desire this SAME finding and false belonging written in history and stained on walls. We realize we are different, we think differently, we have different lives. We are unique souls in plain vessels who no longer remembers half the time of who we really are. Our soul is not wired but our vessels are changed to be so. We are a soul and this vessel is only one life in a million we have or have yet to be. Our life was not just changed by technology, we grew around it. 

Technology allowed us the answer in 2070. Allowed us to leave, to grow, and to change our stuck perspectives from someone else’s mind. We learned that we are either enslaved to ourselves or enslaved to someone else. That there is no true freedom. We learned to overcome the difference in skin, shape, and thoughts from others as we delved deep into the vast universe. We learned our world was tiny and our wars were foolish. We learned to not live separately but under unity through divinity. So within the future everything drastically changed. 13 year old me would laugh at the 68 year old one. I think honestly we all would have laughed. At first, our timeline in this story seemed rough. We seemed cornered and about to give up. I mean wouldn’t anyone else just give up as well. 

I sometimes think we forget we are human. One of the strongest, adaptable, species even if we list that title ourselves. The future is never written to someone of the past but we are neither of the future. The future who holds just glorious pieces of work as their history. We are of the present that accepts the changes others will bring. So no matter how hard it turns out tomorrow it still is a part of your story that shapes a character. We are of the universe and we bring meaning.",Read fully before commenting /Paragraphs.

aliens,"For me, one of the most fascinating aspects of Extraterrestrial Life has been trying to fathom how a society that could be millions of years old would even appear to be structured. 

From day to day life, to the secret of their success, family, species and social structures all of these sociology aspects have been very rare to stumble across in the Extraterrestrial\UFO research since I started looking into the reality of Extraterrestrial life over 30 years ago. 

I have only found a couple of things online, can anyone recommend any additional works I could look into?

I haven’t heard many accounts from the government leaks on this sort of subject. They are always related to Technology and Biology mostly. It would be interesting to see any government study’s findings about this question, has anything along those lines ever been leaked? 

This is along the lines I am thinking if you can get through the paper. I like the examination of a “truly telepathic” society and the fundamental questions raised of 100% mind reading so you couldn’t hide your intentions. That in itself sounds impossible to even truly comprehend in this limited form.

aliens,"I recently listened to an [interview ](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEAgKKzBMlb/?igshid=1avjkz4effqkw) with Chris Mellon in which he discussed the pattern that he uncovered whilst working at AATIP. They apparently seem to be filmed most frequently around deep lakes, oceans and nuclear assets most frequently. 

Evidenced by the incidents at the Nimitz ship,  Aguadilla Airport and Lake Michigan. You can see a footage captured by that airport [here](https://youtu.be/a_2tspVI8rs). The object which was investigated by SCU shows characteristics of being adapted to underwater travelling. 

(I'm barely touching on the surface of how much reliable declassified documents support Chris Mellons statement.)

I would like to tie this all together into a not-too-crazy theory. This planet is 70% water. The oceans are extremely deep, has a variety of specimens, and is barely explored. 

If extraterrestrials are visiting for science expeditions It would make perfect sense to park their ships there. Some might be staying even. The reason why they're concerned about nuclear activities is because they just might be sharing the planet with us. Pollution would destroy their work and way of life.

There are letters in reliable history archives that describe strange lights by the sea and they date back into antiquity. The oldest one I know of so far is Columbus's letter from when he crossed over to America. He saw what could be described today as a UAP.

Second Incident: When i was in Turkey on vacation near the dessert i saw a HUGE Saucer with hundreds of different lights floating in the distance. It floated very slowly AND ominously. The ship was as big or bigger than a football field. Most people were asleep at the time but i think some did also notice it in the distance.

It looked very similar to this:

Then a huge saucer shone right onto her with its lights and she ran as fast as she could to her grandmas house. At the door my mother was knocking but nobody opened. The saucer lost interest and flew away.

""I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. [...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared.""

""Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence.""

— Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII

""We must insist upon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.""

— J. Edgar Hoover, first Director of the FBI

""I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, ""Nope."" And I said to him: ""Let's follow it!"" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it.""

It is recognized that quotes are not proof. However:

There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.

aliens,"So I was thinking last night about the commonality between paranormal events/ufo sightings/phenomena, specifically regarding the frustrating truth that these events ALWAYS seem to leave the door open to some sort of plausible explanation or doubt. So here we go...my hypothesis is that the phenomenon appears to be altering timelines or choosing them for us. Selecting, manipulating, and presenting bits, sections, or whole sequences of timelines which we experience. This may be how or why the phenomenon always leaves a shred of doubt or plausible explanation no matter how bizarre or unlikely the circumstances. 

Perhaps there are certain eventualities that cannot be manipulated or changed completely — there are events which must happen — therefore it is these cases which must present or adhere to us a timeline which ALSO presents a plausible explanation for said event or anomaly. This could explain the ever present “shred of doubt” I referenced with these anomalies, and at the same time account for peripheral effects (e.g. Mandela Effect, current events, and the like).

An example challenge could be the engineering problem, what kind of vessels will we need?

Just something different I guess. Feel free to implement plausible advancements to help with the mission, not things like instant teleportation.

The only reason the we get any activity at all is probably just to check us out for educational purposes

For example, we as humans wouldn't invade a planet of insects when they are inferior species and better resources to collect from other planets, comets or any celestial body irregardless whether they contain life. 

We'd probably only send someone to collect a living sample of the insect and learn from it and or experiment on a few. No need to send the whole human race to collect a few.

We as humans and just as aliens have no reason to spend the precious energy to kill them or invade them when life is probably common to find with more advanced technology and bigger better resources to collect in places other than Earth or other planets alike

Hiii! I hope you all are doing well!  


I just watch the very short but sweet documentary on John Shepherd I honestly wish there was more and I'm going to look more into it. I wish his radio station was still up and running! Totally up my alley.   


So my questions are  


Have you watched?  


What did you think?  


Did you tune into his show if your were old enough then? As someone not far from Michigan I'm wondering if my dad who was very into aliens ever listened and I was too into grunge and backstreet boys and nintendo to care at the moment lol.  


Do you think in today's world if there already isnt one that we should keep trying or do you think there is too much ""noise"" now? I honestly think where I live there wouldnt be cause I'm in the middle of no where you blink and my town is gone lol and theres really no towers therefore crap service so I wonder if I was smart enough and rich if I could get some equipment and try? Idk I'm bored have no life right now and need something to do! I'm sure some can relate!

aliens,"It seems every other day there's a new story hitting the front page of this subreddit, written by some random user who has no substance, no evidence and no history. Do you also want to write a story so you can have your spotlight in history... of a subreddit?

Here's how:

1. Pick your target. You know that /r/aliens is much more open place than /r/UFOs, so you're more likely to get traction there. Pander to those who have such open minds that they'd rather believe a stranger on the internet who wrote some words than their own rational mind.
2. Use the gullibility of your audience. You've read many posts like the one you're about to create before on this subreddit that turn out to be fake or unprovable. Despite this many users here seem to want to believe more than they want to prove, which is exactly why this subject is filled with 99% bullshit and 1% truth. Shit, you don't care about that though, it's time to take advantage of it.
3. Language and storytelling. It's key to use phrases such as ""I don't care if you believe me"" or ""I can't prove it to you, but I know"". An even better direction to take is to make it a story that you heard from someone else! That way you hold no responsibility if it turns out to be true because you were simply passing the story along. 
4. Promise and then underdeliver. If you want your story to be remembered then chuck in some evidience that you either can't find, or don't have access to. This way there is a promise of being able to prove your story true, but it's nigh impossible to do so, therefore a few will remember it and bring it up now and again in a ""remember when..."" comment.
5. Feel no remorse. Those who actually did have an experience which might be less fantastical than yours (I mean, THEY didn't get given a magical space rock, right?) will be forgotten and brushed under the carpet. ""WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MAGIC SPACE ROCK!"" Your audience will cry at you, while simultaneously trampling over those with real experiences who didn't get one :( too bad for them.

That's all! It's not THAT hard, which is why so many people do it! Remember the members of this community would rather protect a random person with a fantastical story than let them go unheard. It's admirable, in a way, however that allows them to fall victim to many people just like you who have nothing better to do inbetween your losing bids in GME. Let's turn this place into /r/nosleep!

- Any considerably strong government/corporation would have vested interests in this discovery. As the entity that patents and develops the energy source could make substantial change in the current world power structure. 


Apply this example to any type of scientific discovery that a world power would deem unsafe, dangerous, or clashing in interest. You will have derivatives of their multi-billion dollar technologies &amp; man-power focused against the scientist or group.


Naturally, in order to maintain status quo. A world power would resort to *manipulation*, *silencing*, *threatening*, the people involved and probably confiscate their work.

aliens,"Just finished reading this book. I don’t see his ideas discussed very often on this sub but they are worthy of discussion. After reading, I’m quite sympathetic to his view that the UFO phenomenon is not merely a space faring alien civilization from a distant star system - it’s much more complex than that and possibly includes a paranormal aspect. 

Below is a key excerpt from his book Dimensions:

“1. The things we call unidentified flying objects are neither objects nor flying. They can dematerialize, as some reliable photographs seem to show, and they violate the laws of motion as we know them.

2. UFOs have been seen throughout history and have consistently received (or provided) their own explanation within the framework of each culture. In antiquity their occupants were regarded as gods; in medieval times, as magicians; in the nineteenth century, as scientific geniuses; in our own time, as interplanetary travelers. (Statements made by occupants of the 1897 airship included such declarations as “We are from Kansas” and even “We are from anywhere … but we’ll be in Greece tomorrow.”)

3. UFO reports are not necessarily caused by visits from space travelers. The phenomenon could be a manifestation of a much more complex technology. If time and space are not as simple in structure as physicists have assumed until now, then the question “where do they come from?” may be meaningless; they could come from a place in time. If consciousness can be manifested outside the body, then the range of hypotheses can be even wider.

4. The key to an understanding of the phenomenon lies in the psychic effects it produces (or the psychic awareness it makes possible) in its observers. Their lives are often deeply changed, and they develop unusual talents with which they may find it difficult to cope. The proportion of witnesses who do come forward and publish accounts of these experiences is quite low; most of them choose to remain silent.

5. Contact between human percipients and the UFO phenomenon always occurs under conditions controlled by the latter. Its characteristic feature is a factor of absurdity that leads to a rejection of the story by the upper layers of the target society and an absorption at a deep unconscious level of the symbols conveyed by the encounter. The mechanism of this resonance between the UFO symbol and the archetypes of the human unconscious has been abundantly demonstrated by Carl Jung, whose book Flying Saucers makes many references to the age-old significance of the signs in the sky.”

It was a typical kid type explanation and quite generic, much like something you’d see on a movie like Aliens In The Attic. And I always give my kids the benefit of the doubt. I hear them out. Asked if they wanted to come stay with me, all that stuff a dad does.

The next day I was looking through the local classifieds online and there was an ad in there from some dude who wanted to know if anyone else had seen UFO activity of the town the night before. His description was exactly what they kids described to me.

And it was in that moment I knew unequivocally that my kids sighting was legitimately a UFO sighting. 

I showed the kids the ad and they never even felt like they were vindicated because I listened to them and never downplayed their experience.

This idea that we're all tied together in some large way and that somehow our consciousness has an impact on the universe was intriguing and cool and all but...

It's dumb. I'm sorry guys. I know I'm gonna get hate here, but I gave it a really fair chance and it was so wacked out and that's not due to my lack of imagination. 


Parts I got lost at:
Higher forms of consciousness comes from parts of the universe where light is more abundant? 

No one actually seems to agree on what the Law of One stands for and the philosophies surrounding the idea?

The fact that the echelons of higher density's are separated by ridiculous human traits like love and understanding and that these holier than though traits are universally important?

The fact that the Law of One explains everything by actually explaining nothing?

Look. It's a nice thought, and maybe there's some substance to even the basic thought that we all exist together as one. But it's just that, a nice thought that applies to nothing and explains nothing about the phenomena we see.

Do you know how much “light” is out there that we can’t even comprehend or begin to understand? So, what if- there is a planet inside of our planet (hollow earth theory) but, this planet is made entirely out of light that we cannot see. But, those light beings can see us. (Explains ghosts, all seeing eye, always doing the right thing because the religion is watching, spiritual signs, prayers and manifestation) but, these beings can come “in and out” of our world whenever some sort X,Y,Z’s cross (explains aliens, ghost sightings, Bigfoot sightings, monster sightings, etc) and that’s also how they communicate with us “telepathically” because without physical matters there’s no need for sound, or even possible.

This is where you go when you die, because it’s here, but it’s not here physically.

aliens,"One evening 27 years ago, my younger brother and I saw something strange that we still talk about to this day. I was 22 and he was 19 at the time. We used to have a friend who lived a couple of houses down from us, and we'd arranged earlier that day to meet up to hang out after watching the F1 race that was happening that afternoon. 

So we finished watching the race, had some dinner, then walked to my friend's house. He saw us from his front-facing bedroom window and motioned he'd be ready in a few minutes. As we were stood at his gate waiting, I just happened to look up because I'd already noticed it was a particularly starry evening. As I'm looking, I saw what I thought was a shooting star. I excitedly grabbed my brother's arm and told him to look, pointing with my other hand at the star. It was moving at what must have been a massive speed, considering the distance, and we were both kind of in awe because we'd never seen anything like this before. 

As we're watching, I started to say something about it being good luck to see a shooting star, but as I was saying it, the thing suddenly stopped dead. We both jumped a bit because we obviously weren't expecting that. Then, as we watched, it darted off at a 90° angle and carried on for about 5 seconds, before suddenly stopping again. Then it shot off at another angle before stopping dead again. It did this about 8 or 9 times, before speeding off at an angle away from us, until it grew smaller and simply disappeared. 

We were both speechless for a few seconds before we started talking about what we'd seen. Our friend came out, saw us looking up, and asked what we were looking for. We told him what had just happened but he just laughed and accused us of playing around. We spoke about it on and off during the course of that night and I think he eventually started to believe us. 

Anyway, we still don't know to this day what we saw, and I can't think of anything it could have possibly been. This was May 1994 (I know this because it was the same day Ayrton Senna, the F1 driver, died in the race we'd watched that afternoon) so I'm guessing there wasn't anything terrestrial that was technologically capable of moving around like that. 

It looked exactly like the stars around it - same kind of size and brightness etc, which is why I initially thought it was a shooting star. It was the suddenness of the way it just stopped dead that shocked me. It'd hang there for a few seconds before shooting off again at a vastly different angle before suddenly stopping again. 

We both saw the exact same thing and both remember it the same way. We hadn't been drinking or taking drugs by the way! 😂

aliens,"Just to preface, I am sorry I don't have the picture but I will describe what I saw.  On a phone of someone trusted, he shows a picture of what he took of the total lunar eclipse.  Back to back photos taken only seconds apart first show a black sky and the elipse, then show something exposed in the suns light reflecting off earth.  4 elongated disk objects can be seen in the sky around the position of the moon.  It's safe to say they were in the outer atmosphere or just beyond.  These were definately disk shaped and it seemed that the light was not generated by these objects but reflected by them.  I always say that any ufo/uap is a bit sus if it's an orb of light or flashing lights.  What is truly out there does not want to be seen and has the technology not to be exposed.  I'm working on trying to get this picture but the man wants nothing to do with posting it on the web.  If anyone else took pictures that evening, re-examine those photos because something was out there.

aliens,"My friend's grandfather died about 15 years ago and was regarded by his family as a straight-shooter, no bullshit kind of guy. He served in WW2 in the South Pacific and rarely, if ever, spoke about his time in the military. 2 weeks before his death, he called my friend into his room and asked him to please pay very careful attention to what he had to say. My friend was 13 at the time.

He goes on to explain that during his time as a soldier near the end of WW2, one of the duties he was often asked to do was survey these tiny islands in the South Pacific for evidence of Japanese soldiers that may have been stranded or living in hiding. Usually, he would go along with 2-3 other men and search these tiny islands over the course of a day or two. One afternoon, he is tasked to survey a particularly tiny island with 3 other men. Two men went off to search one side of the island while my friend's grandfather sets off on the opposite with an equally young fellow soldier.

There was a large rock that they decided to climb in order to get a better view of the surrounding area.  After climbing, the other soldier spots a large odd object with his binoculars in a tree with their view being mostly obstructed by other trees. It was clearly metal and gray but they were unable to tell what it was. They then agreed that they needed to get slightly closer to investigate.

As stealthily as they could manage, they moved through the terrain to get closer. They hid under the cover of some vegetation, with my friend's grandfather holding the binoculars and his partner holding his gun.Through the binoculars, he gets a clear view of the object. 

It's a large gray craft that was roughly 40 feet in length. It was shaped like an almond except that there was a large bubble like shelf on one side that ran along it length wise. It had no windows and was uniform in color and texture, which was an obsidian gray. Part of the craft was being supported on a few large tree branches and the other half seemed to be suspended in air. Standing on the shelf of a vehicle was a roughly 7 foot tall slender humanoid creature that was facing towards the craft. It had an enlarged head and the skin was like a dolphins. It was clearly touching the craft and flashes of light could be seen whenever it touched it. Underneath the craft were two other identical humanoids facing one another but unmoving as if frozen. They had large black eyes that looked like an owl's but without a nose or mouth. Through the binoculars, he was trying to get a better view of one of the alien's faces when it suddenly looked directly at their hiding spot. The next thing he knows, he is standing alongside his partner, completely paralyzed and now only an arms length from a single alien. The gun and binoculars are on the ground and the only thing he can move are his eyes. The alien towers over him for a few seconds before lifting its arm. He couldn't look at its face because he couldn't move his neck. He couldn't remember how many fingers it had but only that it looked completely different from a human hand. One digit touches his forehead and the next thing he knows is he is laying alongside his partner and all trace of the aliens and the craft are gone with the exception of broken branches under the tree that the craft touched.

Both my friend's grandfather and his fellow soldier are in near hysterical terror at this point. After they collect themselves enough to try to find the other soldiers, my friend's grandfather realizes he has something in his pocket. It is an egg shaped stone that looked almost as if it was the same material as the ship. It looked like volcanic rock except that parallel lines were engraved along its entire surface, like a topographical map. He shows it to the other soldier who demands that he throw it away. He refuses. They both then told this story to their commanding officer as soon as possible who must've thought it was some kind of prank because they were both punished. Fearful of people thinking he was insane since there were schizophrenics in his family, he never told anyone else.

After telling all this to my friend, he then asks him to open the safe underneath his bed. Inside it, along with some of his grandmother's jewelry, was the egg shaped rock. He then asks my friend to take it from him. After his grandfather's death, my friend tells the rest of his family about the rock but none of them know what to make of it. To this day, my friend keeps it in a shoebox in his childhood bedroom at his parent's house. Back before we stopped hanging out, I encouraged him to show it to someone who would study it but he said he didn't want anybody to confiscate it since he has a sentimental attachment to it. I feel like he must've had a different reason that he didn't talk about though. I haven't spoken to him in over 5 years now but I still think about this story all the time.

aliens,"OKAY, so here we go. One fine September night 2010-2011 (I can’t remember for sure it was a while ago I was about 13)
me and my twin brother saved up enough money to buy some RC helicopters, and instead of waiting till the next day to play with them, we went out after dark to play in the back yard. Maybe 9-10pm after the sun had set.
That’s the set and setting of our encounter.

So we’re playing with them and the wind is making it difficult and we end up breaking the propeller blades within the hour, and we’re talking about it and we see about four houses away across our cities main road of Holmes Ave. a big, white, ball thing. I asked him if he saw what I saw and he said we’re both seeing it so we’re not crazy, it looked like a giant tic tac sorta, maybe a little chubbier, I told him to go inside and get our disposable camera, but I said I’d keep an eye on it hoping me watching would make it not move, so he went in and started looking, I watched it for about 10 minutes, and he came back out, it must’ve left pretty quick, but it didn’t even make a noise, because as soon as I looked back from him coming out of the house, it was gone. I only wish this was after we had gotten camera phones, because I would’ve gotten it on camera for sure.
I might sound crazy but I know what I saw and even years later my twin brother can attest that we both saw it that night.

Just last month I saw a video of a UAP from some guys in military planes, above the ocean, and I swear that’s the same thing I saw hovering silently that night.

aliens,"Im very skeptical about sharing this but this is too crazy not to share. Last night around 11pm was my second sighting ever. This shit was legit crazy. I’m still mind fucked about it. 

I was on my balcony staring at the stars as I always do and i always play a game. I stare at one star then wait for another star to catch my attention then move to that one  and stare at it and so on and so on. It adjusts your eyes that you are able to see stars that u wouldn’t be able to see normally that are super super far away. 

So anyway an hour into doing this with my neck hurting like shit I notice something is fucking with me and blinking and disappearing. It literally felt like it was doing it on purpose. I kept catching the blink and it would zoom away instantly and sometimes leave a trail of light behind it. At first I thought I was just tripping but I kept catching it over and over then I finally  got a good look at it and said in my mind “ I got you this time  fucker I know ur out there” After that it stopped, I kept staring into the same spots for about 10 more minutes and nothing. No more light blinking or flashing or zooming away . So I return to just looking out forward on my balcony with a normal head position out into the distance just thinking to myself these fuckers are legit out here. About 3 minutes pass by then this happens. 

I shit you not on my dead mother and everything I love in my head I say “ show yourselves I know your out there” and the blinking light that I was catching up super far away flew right in front of me about 1500 feet high( judging by Flightradar24 and past flights I see daily)  in a straight fucking line for about 2 seconds and disappeared. I literally screamed “ holy shit” out lout and pretty sure everyone heard it in my neighborhood. It was a round ball of light that just fucking flew right infront of my fucking eyes. I fucking saw it from a not so far distance and it was no fucking shooting star or meteor. I’ve seen many of those before. 

I swear these things have the capability to read our minds. This fucking thing knew what I was thinking. Honest to god and my dead mother this thing flew right on front of my fucking face and eyes about 2-3 miles out and 1500-2000 feet high ( jusdging by Flightradar24 flights that I monitored) and it came out of no where just light up for 2 seconds zoomed past my fucking eyes and disappeared.

Elizondo also states many would turn toward or away from philosophical and theological thought. 

that left me thinking about statements made by Tom Delonge, best found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/drngzw/a_summary_of_tom_delonges_statements_about_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMysterySchool/comments/hu2q0m/a_comprehensive_analysis_on_why_tom_delonge_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Tom implies some beings connected to the UFO phenomena have influenced our history for possibly millennia and seem to have ties to consciousness.

I do not believe Elizondo’s statement on “soul searching” was done without cognizance. 

In[this](https://youtu.be/H86X4hjnrAo) lecture by DR Karla Turner, at 40:10 she makes her statement of “Fact Number 10” wherein she asserts that the phenomena is interested in souls.

""Whatever was planned for July is still going to happen so far as I know, but it has definitely changed. (...) I don’t know what it all will be on the 18th, either, except that Gina 2 and the Friends of Friends are leaving and someone else is coming and that whatever will happen on Earth is not colonization. I’ve seen maps up there and it looks like on the 18th something will happen at least in western Africa, something in maybe China or around China, and in Wyoming or Colorado or Utah. It’s hard for me to know where stuff is just looking at maps without the state and country borders on them but none of the maps up there have any of those lines so I’m making educated guesses on those three spots.""

aliens,"People usually think that they could understand aliens, drawing conclusions based on their views of the world and the universe, but such conclusions could be wrong. I will give my opinion in following text.

**Alert! Long text**

**First misperception: Flying objects**

We usually think that those UAPs or UFOs are flying objects made by aliens who once they fall we will know more about extraterrestrial technology and be able to reverse engenering them. 

Any of us would think that those objects hide inside some complex technology and build up by mysterious materials. But what if there is nothing inside, literally empty or filled space who is build up by ordinary materials that could be found on Earth, but somehow manage to fly at high speed and move tic-tac. We could possibly made theory that they are somehow controlled by remote from far distance, but it would be never confrimed and the case would be closed.

**Second misperception: Life form of ETs**

Any of us think that ETs are highly advanced civilization, who managed to travel through space with spaceships who travel at the speed of light. This kind of view comes by science point of view based by our current understanding and covered by sci-fi popular-culture.
We think it makes sense that there is an advanced species who looks similar(humanoid) to us, because there are a billion planets in the universe. Perhaps they are not an advanced civilization originating from a planet, but, say, an intelligent energy that is present throughout the universe, and where the human brain cannot perceive or comprehend it.

Keep in mind that if man saw an ET creature 500 years ago, he would see him as angel or monster/demon. He would never thought that those thing comes from another planet. It all depends on our current understandings.

So my guess is, the further we progress as civilization, the new views and ideas will open up to us on this topic.

**Third misperception: Size**

Why we all think that aliens are human-size +/- like? As far as I know intelligence does not depend on size. The aliens could be the height of a Burj-Khalifa or the size of an ant. This is another misperception that people create.

**Fourth misperception: Contact**

Why do we think they will make contact with us? Maybe the difference in intelligence is so great, that they actually observe us the way we observe  bees. Probably someone will say, so well probably if they are so advanced they will know our language. Even if they do, they couldn’t teach us much because of our intellectual limitations. Second scenario would be if they change our DNA code so we could be on same intellectual level as them.

**My conclusion:** I think that there is definitely something going on, but I am afraid and I wouldn’t be suprised if we couldn’t comprehend these things at all. Maybe government have some more evidence and materials, but they are quite uninterested because from the current knowledge, they can't make progress in understanding those things.

aliens,"Last night I had a dream that the world had finally found proof of aliens living in our atmosphere. I've not long woken up so I'm writing this before the details get too hazy. It was a very short dream but it's really stuck with me.

I remember hearing the news and how they found out; they (not sure who but some kind of scientists) essentially took these reaaaaaly long pipes into the sky and put them through huge clouds and dropped/fired big magnets through them. This somehow detected that there are aliens in crafts living in our clouds which just seems weird now the more I'm awake and thinking about it.

I can't remember if I properly saw the aliens in my dream, it's like a slight flicker of a memory but I feel like they were traditional and were using saucer style ships.

The one thing I remember about the dream was being so excited that we've finally proved that we're not alone and I felt quite upset that it was all a dream when I had woken up.

So yeah, a very short dream but I thought I'd share as it was weird because I haven't dreamt about aliens/ufos in at least 10 years and I don't know what brought it on as I'm usually always looking at alien/ufo topics anyway.",I had my first alien dream in about 10 years last night
aliens,"If we look back over time, given all the evidence that has been collected, from all over our planet, and where the public have repeatedly been given false hopes of disclosure, it seems fairly clear that something extraordinary is going to have to take place, before the gatekeepers of the worst kept secret in history, provide us with the information we both demand and deserve. If we look at the massive amount of effort taken to suppress, deflect, ridicule, obfuscate and misdirect anyone that seeks to gather, or prove the existence of, irrefutable evidence that the UFO phenomenon is real, we can clearly see a pattern of behaviour that thus far, has done a terrible job in keeping these secrets. Mainly because those people that have experienced something incredible, want to talk about it. Make sense of it. Understand how their experience fits into their version of reality. These are profound and important events that deeply affect the people who live through them. And there are literally millions of people, around our planet, that have been witnessing the incredible, over decades, perhaps centuries. We know, that this phenomena, and our understanding of it, possibly represents a complete paradigm shift in our sociological and cultural development. 

For too long though, we have relied on key individuals to move us closer to disclosure. But the proof is out there, right in front of us, they are our neighbours, our families, our friends, the very people in our communities, that have these incredible stories to tell and all we need do, is listen. Some of them may work in government, or the military or your local grocery store, but for all those people that are either experiencers or witnesses or have secrets they wish to tell, in the end it will be these people collectively, that show us the truth. These people deserve answers or redemption. They deserve their peace of mind.  When I think about the history of UFO sightings, I am moved to consider those individuals, faced with the extraordinary, abandoned to ridicule, stigma and a lifetime of questions, and I mourn the fact that these people aren’t heralded, respected and given the support they so rightly need. 

I think that anyone, that can do anything, regardless of their background, to further the education, awareness and understanding of the issue should be encouraged and supported wholeheartedly. The UFO community is a cynical, bruised and untrusting one at times, and for good reason. But sometimes, along the way, we forget why we are so passionate about learning the truth, and how that truth is revealed. We care because this is THE most important question of our time, and it is blatantly obvious that there are those among us, that either through direct experience, or by being privy to data, know much more than they are telling us. I believe that within the TTSA there are people that fit this description. 

I think that through community action, petitions, contacting local govt. officials, raising awareness there is a way to collectively help tip the momentum in the favour of those that deserve the truth. I think falling into destructive, divisive, cynical behaviours so often characterised in typical online discourse, is exactly what we are expected to do. But if we work together, support those on our side, and keep remembering why we’re doing this, and the experiencers we need to serve, we can all do our part, collectively, to move towards a time when we can share our knowledge freely, and attempt to understand what that means for us, as human beings.",What we should all think about TTSA

We will put the source details down below.

Since the video was edited, our Vid Forensics guy has said he is sure the footage was filmed not far out of Desert Hot Springs in California although that has yet to be confirmed.

Once you get through watching the main footage, which is not so steady, our VF guy zoomed it in and did some motion tracking stabilizing of the video to get a better look at things.

Maybe sometimes some organized group of searching for ""escaped convicts""

Maybe some are quietly living among us and others are trading technology for privacy/safety?

So all life is/are composed of microbes (cells like prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic animals to in include humans). There are speculations of harmful microbes (bacteria and viruses) that are sent from space and dispursed into earth from aliens. Some say Hitler received higher technology from aliens and that's why German innovation was on top and why Hitler had was so desperate, meticulous, and secret about space and extraterrestrial encounters. So think why is there trouble getting a vaccine created for Covid-19 during a time when we've surpassed and obtained so much tech?? The world population has become so diverse genetically. Variety of genetic structures from person to person allows for microbe mutations. While these cells are always advancing and adapting, we are not. So if we all had the same genetic structures and sequence it would be so easy to come up with vaccines for anything and everything.  If we all had the same genetic structure and wanted to live forever we could do that as that society kinda. It would be easy to navigate with our tech and science today for 1 species, 1 genome sequence, and just 1 overall being of type. In a decade if all science and math from around the world was dedicated  to advancements of 1 specific race you could know how to not only stop organ failure but reverse it, kick on the immune system with science based medicines, be able to preserve skin, bones, and have anti aging. Over all this is possible but only for 1 species. Which is sad to say but 1 species in dominance may mean living eternally which may be why Hitler may have believed that there was a master race, why supremacy was founded and exist. So we, as humans, could of been able to reach such dominance but without a mass extinction it wouldn't be possible. So essentially the human race will one day become extinct due to having so many variations of genetic sequencing. We will never be able to keep up with more advanced microbes that can always adapt, evolve, and thrive. This bring me to my last point, its evident that within the next 100 years humans will be extinct due to the circumstances mentioned above and the only way that the human race will succeed is with 1 with surving pure race that will become self sufficient but the only way it can be brought on is by another holocaust. So knowing all of this  and putting it together the existence of white supremacy or a master race is stupid because we have long surpassed that chance because we have become so diverse. We may also have been told this through profecies of a master race by following the story  of Adam and Eve and how we reproduced.

aliens,"I'm assuming here that aliens with an essentially similar biology to life on Earth do exist, and this doesn't mean that I think all life has to have nucleosides and peptides. 

But here on Earth humans are amongst the longer lived animals. I will say that human evolution should continue in the direction of greater longevity, as it should for more advanced species in general, as longevity is a feature I believe of civilisation and high intelligence - it in the first place requires time and a lot of experimentation and experience to acquire expertise. 

Imagine if humans had the equivalent life of 300 years, 200+ of which academically and vocationally, and what kind of society that would create!

There is a problem though, humans reach a physical limit around 80 to 100 years of age, or about 3 generations of the family being alive simultaneously. The peak age for scientific work I believe is around 36 years of age, imagine if Da Vinci had another 100 years at his peak! 

The limitation is ultimately due to genetic deterioration, we are comprised of two genetic machines, one which is the nuclear DNA, and the other is the mitochondrial DNA. To reduce aging which is particularly rapid in the mitochondrial DNA, the cells in our body undergo a process whereby damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria are digested, and removed from the pool, the healthy survives, fuse and replicate to replace the damaged ones. This still however doesn't work well enough, and so mitochondrial aging is a key feature of aging, as is now believed. 

One solution an alien could have is the ability to traffic pristine, fresh mitochondria maintained in a special reservoir so that the rate of mitochondrial aging was much less. These would be distributed to invigorate the pool of aged mitochondria in each cell. Alternatively, the mitochondrial DNA can be backed up, in the nuclear DNA. 

In addition to this, a second nucleus in each cell might function as a backup to the first, allowing periodic gene repairs that are more effective at repairing the data. The second one could also replicate maybe once every few decades. It would be otherwise sealed off to a greater extent, protected from free radicals and viruses. This would have to involve a superior membrane of some kind within the cell.  

Also better gene repair and gene protection can be imagined.

Of course, a bizarre feature of eukaryotes in Earth is that they have this dual system of mitochondria, derived from bacteria, and nuclear DNA. It's possible to imagine there might be other arrangements out there. But it works because the mitochondria generate energy, and hence decay very fast, and so cannot be using the same nuclear DNA. They evolved fast as bacteria however.  By removing the damaged mitochondria and allowing the survivors to replicate, a process that involves the ability of the mitochondria to generate a membrane potential, is able to work quite well over the human life span but starts running out by the senior years.

But I believe what we would see is that longed lived aliens might have a strategy to preserve their genetic material better than we have.",Plausible Genetics of Similar (to animal) Alien Biology

aliens,"have you noticed how our technology has evolved lately? today there are already robots capable of shooting, jumping and communicating with other robots through telepathy; the robots literally have an infinite mind of knowledge, being much more efficient than us; there is also a probability of being our own creation from a distant future, after all, to wander through space without causing any type of bodily harm would be very difficult, even more so at a great speed; who knows, the Aliens are not actually our own creation in the distant future coming the earth give us knowledge? because we know the technology earlier, we improve it sooner we will create them sooner, what would we do if we didn’t have those ""gods"" in the past giving us mathematical, astronomical and geographic knowledge? evolved isn't it? a lot of people believe that robots will dominate the world someday, it may be true, we are nothing to them, in that future they may have already destroyed us and are and returned to another planet, but for some reason they needed our species, they needed to give us knowledge earlier, would it be just an ambition to improve themselves or is there any other reason why they need us? a robotic mind is capable of storing millions and millions data and access all of them easily, it wouldn't be difficult for them to travel through space and discover things that we have tried to do for centuries; and the Aliens are our own creation of a distant future? after all, if they arrived here as our own creation, declaring themselves robots from a distant future made by our race, would we stop making them or would we continue to risk creating our own extinction? it would be easier to arrive as gods and give us knowledge to improve their world, no? ..",robots?

aliens,"I usually don't talk about my dreams because I hardly remember them. Last night I had an almost perfectly clear dream of an alien invasion. It was very real to me because I felt the specific emotions that would be felt in the exact moment if it were really happening. Very ""realistic"" feeling, if I could describe it. I was just sitting at home when I heard commotion going on outside. When I went to go look in the sky, two huge disk shape ships flew past. My heart literally fell through my stomach because it was so shocking to me.

Again, I hear a huge bang and these monsterous ships started coming out of the ground. People crying, I could visually see the emotions on my families face. I couldn't believe what I was feeling either. This specific dream gave me the feeling of my life flashing before my eyes. It was a dream though right? It felt so real to me though, I felt like that actually had to have happened. If not this reality perhaps another? Have I been thinking about aliens too much? Or is this crazy dream a possible future experience we might have? 

Anyone have dreams like these? Aliens invading, unforgettable moments, pain and suffering? I'm really curious because I have never remembered a dream this well.",Weird dream.....
aliens,"   This is just food for thought. So im gonna go with the numbers and lay out a hypothetical scenario. Even if only a fraction of a percent of planets manage to give birth to what would be an intellegent species, it would still be a huge number because of how big the universe is. Lets assume said life developed in a million different ways because each path would be its own unique evolution so it would make sense. Now im gonna make another assumption that i dont feel is going out on a limb and say humans are not the apex of intelligence among this collection of species that could have/do exist (ed) over this collosal amount of time and space. Now look at how technology has snowballed over recent years. Particularly the last 100 years. I would theorize that deep space faring species should actually be more likely than not, due not as much to some species having x amount of time to develop technologically more than we have, but that  just a few differences in evolutionary path that produced traits far better suited for developing said technology. Picture if humans had a global ""hive mind"" of sorts. If our nature wasnt to spend the bulk of our resources fighting each other, hiding technology, and pissing away most of our efforts on menial tasks.. And instead were internally driven to advance and survive and spread out. Weve advanced a long ways in 100 years, even though we intentionally cripple our own ability to do so. Given that there is more likely than not a species or many that resemble something like i described, it should not really come as a suprise that theres ufos roaming our skies with tech we don't understand, or in many cases arent even believed in. I Imagine a more intelligent species with a connected goal could develop at an exponentially faster rate than even we have in our best years. Or even better, theres fairly compelling evidence that there is a kind of collective knowledge that can be tapped into by some people. If a species were to master how to access that they would be a biological version of what we fear AI might become very rapidly if unleashed on the world. Just some thoughts i wanted to share. Any feedback is appreciated except those unwilling to even have a thought exercise that involves the assumption of intelligence being (while not common) vastly abundant.  I know theres no proof of this. But the numbers suggest a good probability it would exist",Assuming there are millions or billions of other intellegent species in the universe....

aliens,"So a bit of context and background re: my beliefs. I've always been fascinated with UFOs, aliens, stuff like the Nasca lines, pyraminds etc, ever since I was a teen and received my first Time Life Mysteries of the unknown volumes. But it's always been in the back of my head like ""Heh, that'd be cool IF it were true"". Not skeptical, more like open to the possibilities of it all but not entirely convinced either, you might say. Didn't come from a religious family but I attended plenty of church staying Saturdays overnight with friends of various beliefs. Catholic, Southern Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Jewish, even Hindi and Muslim. I was accepting of all as equal friends and by proxy, respected their beliefs as well. I myself developed my own spiritual beliefs in part because of how contradictory yet also similar, as well as sometimes hypocritical these theological viewpoints were. To me, if there were a Universal Creator, they didn't love this side over that, this religion or peoples over that. We're all their children. After learning more throughout my life, the ways some religions would poach and then twist the ideas and concepts of others and make them their own (especially Christianity), I had a falling out with spiritualism for the most part.  Guess I'd say I'm Agnostic with a hint of Athiest. I believe in...something. I just don't know what.

Fast forward a number of decades. The recent influx of UFO activity, FOIA document releases and non-denials/partial admittance by certain governments has brought me back to the world of the unknown. Yet this entire time, I've been excited for the prospect that life elsewhere is likely extraterrestial, and we have brothers/sisters/friends/enemies among the stars. But I always kept in mind these would be completely alien peoples, technology, etc, meaning not of this Earth but part of our shared reality, just much further away. I took a sort of comfort in that, and made peace with it a long time ago. ""Okay, so we're not alone in the universe, so what?"". UFOs = extraterrestrial aliens. Period. Then I found this (and other) subs, watching the more respected YouTubers and listening to podcasts, etc. Once I started learing about all the (what I'd call) fringe theories/discussions...interdimensional beings, beings from parallel timestreams or universes, time travellers, existing terrestrial entities, mental projections and shared consciousness stuff, I started going ""okay, this shit's getting WAYYY too tinfoil-hatty for me"" and almost dipped out. Then I listened to an interview with Tom DeLonge, and it nearly sealed that deal for me. He goes on about the beings showing us what they think we can understand, about Greek Gods returning, about all this mental projection stuff, which I started dismissing. And then he said something that almost frightened me... ""When I learned the truth, I couldn't sleep for three days straight"". This is a man surrounded by high-level intelligence people, military personnel, respected scientists, people who you think would be the first to dismiss all this oogey boogey stuff. and go ""No, it's just aliens"". But they haven't, and that's when the fear started to settle in a bit. 

Then came the sheer terror, to which I still don't know how to process... Jacques Vallee's whitepaper  ""Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects"". But one thing's for certain, that terror it has instilled in me? It goes back to that whole religious learning experience when I was younger. For once, something I was SURE was just built on human ignorance, misunderstanding, greed and a need for control over others, that something being religion in general...now I wasn't so sure. And that frightened me. I thought I had it all figured out and in some ways mocked those of the past that either a) let a simple, explainable thing become the basis for crazy religions or b) let people like me who KNEW it was bull exploit the more ignorant masses' own fears to hold control over them. I felt ""Man, people could be gullible back then, and even now, in believing all this religious garbage"". and for the very first time in my life... I felt that very same fear, that sheer terror: That beings we can't explain, can't comprehend, whose very appearance would likely drive us mad if we ever saw their true forms not only exist, contradicting everything I've believed for nearly my entire life. And when you hear Tom DeLonge speak about those types of entities, you can slightly hear that same fear in his voice, especially when he talked about what kept him up those nights: learning everything you thought you knew was WAY off the mark. And that to me is truly terrifying.

Back to jacques Vallee, reading his paper made me feel sick to the stomach. He's been one of the most respected names in this field for nearly half a century. He should be the first guy to reinforce my original idea that ""Yeah, there's no crazy deity-level shit going on here, it's JUST aliens from other worlds or under our seas"". But he's the exact oppoite, and that's what brought about my fear full circle: even this man is saying they're possibly entities manipulating how our minds perceive them to not drive us insane, they're essentially gods from other realms/dimensions who are so advanced, so beyond us that again, our minds have to be manipulated to comprehend them, or they really ARE extraterrestrials but the same concept of mental image manipulation applies. Any/all of these fall outside my purview of logic, reasoning or even understanding. And akin to our ancestors, that same fear is swelling,

What to me is the most paralyzing concept of all this is, your rational mind goes ""Well, it could be either a), b), c), d), e) or f), but obviously not g) ALL of the above. But from what I'm hearing/reading from respected sources that are in the know a lot more than you or I, it very well might be leaning more towards g). And as I felt as a child, first hearing about all these competing/opposing forces that instill the fear a child is expected to feel, a fear I lost as innocence waned and I grew more confident in my beliefs as I got older, that same child-fear is what's coming back many years later... and I honestly don't know HOW to feel. Beyond just plain scared.

I'm gonna go crawl under my blankey with my nite-lite now.","If this is the truth, I can see why Tom DeLonge could not sleep for three straight nights after learning it..."

aliens,"&gt;After a closed-door session with a scientific advisory panel chaired by H.P. Robertson from the California Institute of Technology, the C.I.A. issued a secret report recommending a broad educational program for all intelligence agencies, with the aim of “training and debunking.”

&gt;Training meant more public education on how to identify known objects in the sky. “The use of true cases showing first the ‘mystery’ and then the ‘explanation’ would be forceful,” the report said. Debunking “would be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, and popular articles.”

&gt;That plan involved using psychologists, advertising experts, amateur astronomers and even Disney cartoons to create propaganda to reduce public interest. And civilian U.F.O. groups should be “watched,” the report stated, because of their “great influence on mass thinking if widespread sightings should occur.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/television/project-blue-book-history-true-story.html

One of the tactics they used was to only show the solved reports. Don't mention the cases that defy explanation. 

&gt;...It was the typical negative approach. I know that the negative approach is typical of the way that material is handed out by the Air Force because I was continually being told to ""tell them about the sighting reports we've solved—don't mention the unknowns."" I was never ordered to tell this, but it was a strong suggestion and in the military when higher headquarters suggests, you do.

-The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, by Edward J. Ruppelt, Air Force Director of Project Grudge and Blue Book [1956] - Chapter 5, page 62.

Any UFO reports which could affect national security went into a separate system from the public ""Project Blue Book."" 

&gt;...Moreover, reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11, and are not part of the Blue Book system (Atch 10). The Air Force experience therefore confirms the impression of the University of Colorado researchers ""that the defense function could be performed within the framework established for intelligence and surveillance operations without the continuance of a special unit such as Project Blue Book.""

&gt;...Termination of Project Blue Book would have no adverse effect on Air Force operations or research programs.

&gt;...Termination of Project Blue Book would leave no official federal office to receive reports of UFOs. However, as already stated, reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.

Declassified document: https://www.nicap.org/docs/Bolender_draft.pdf

Background information: https://www.nicap.org/Bolender_Memo.htm

Note that the government claimed in 1969 they were no longer interested in studying and collecting information on flying saucers. The above declassified document proves that false. 

Here is Colonel William T. Coleman and Colonel Friend on the history of Blue Book, along with an anonymous scientist working for the government on the mysterious disappearance of good UFO reports that were siphoned off and sent to a covert UFO study program that continued to exist after Blue Book was publicly canceled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6kjhZKNt8w

We also know that at least 11 different government agencies/departments were collecting information on UFOs, not just the Air Force, and many of their files remained classified. 

&gt;Even the possibility that these unknowns could be evidence of extraterrestrial visitations has been given serious attention in Government circles. While official interest in U.F.O.'s has long been thought to be strictly the concern of the Air Force, the bulk of whose records has been open to public view for nearly a decade, the recently released papers on U.F.O.'s indicate otherwise. The Departments of the Army, Navy, State and Defense, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and even the Atomic Energy Commission produced U.F.O. records over the years. Many of these agencies still do, and many of their documents remain classified. But it is the C.I.A. that appears to have played the key role in the controversy, and may even be responsible for the Government's conduct in U.F.O. investigations throughout the years. 

https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/14/archives/ufo-files-the-untold-story.html

Even though the government was trying to hoard the good stuff, Project Blue Book Special Report 14, a massive study on flying saucers done for the Air Force, concluded that over 20 percent of the thousands of cases they looked at could not be identified after attempts to debunk them. The higher the quality of case, the more likely it could not be explained. A full third of their excellent cases could not be identified. However, a fact such as this is detrimental to what they were trying to accomplish, so in 1955, the government put out a misleading statement that only 3 percent of reports were unknowns. Many of the older Blue Book cases used in this study came out prior to the massive clampdown on information. Conclusions: of all cases, 22 percent were unknowns. 42 percent explained with certainty. 27 percent doubtfully explained. 9 percent insufficient information to make a determination.

Note the 3 percent figure, which was spread through the media. They also claimed if they had more data on the sightings, they could probably explain that 3 percent as well. This is at odds with their own results. The unknowns were an entirely separate category. They had another category of ""insufficient information to make a determination."" Since the higher the quality of report, the more likely it could not be explained, this suggests that more information would actually not allow them to explain the sightings. It was the other way around. 33.3 percent of the excellent cases were unknowns, as opposed to 16.6 percent of the poor cases. They had radar-visual sightings, multiple witness cases, and many highly credible witnesses, and simply could not find conventional explanations for over 20 percent of them.

Especially during the later years of Blue Book, according to the government's own scientific advisor, they were coming up with incompetent conventional explanations for UFOs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book#Hynek's_criticism

Another propaganda tactic they used was ridicule. If they could make the subject scientifically unrespectable, people would laugh and the government would receive less pushback from scientists and the media.

James E. McDonald, senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics and professor in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona:

&gt;""Scientists all over the world have been misled by over-confidence in the quality of the research on UFOs by the U.S. Air Force,"" he said.  ""First among the jobs is to erase the ridicule which has placed the UFOs on the shelf as a 'nonsense problem'.""

&gt;McDonald said: ""Because of the current official, journalistic and scientific ridicule, there has been almost no scientific attention given to the problem."" 

-'Erase Ridicule'  McDonald Asks U.N. To Begin Study of UFOs,  Tucson, Arizona Daily Citizen, June 15, 1967. Link: http://physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/Family/James/670615_tucson_daily_citizen_jun_15_1967.pdf

J. Allen Hynek, member of the Robertson Panel, PhD astrophysics, astronomer and government scientific advisor to UFO studies: 

&gt;""Ridicule is not part of the scientific method, and people should not be taught that it is. The steady flow of reports, often made in concert by reliable observers, raises questions of scientific obligation and responsibility."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek 

&gt;“The implication in the Panel Report was that U.F.O.s were a nonsense (nonscience) matter, to be debunked at all costs,” Hynek wrote. “It made the subject of U.F.O.s scientifically unrespectable.” https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/television/project-blue-book-history-true-story.html

In a 1960 letter to Congress, Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, who was first Director of the CIA, stated:

&gt;""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""

aliens,"Hello all. 

First let me just say that I do believe in the existence of aliens and I think it's quite possible that they have even visited Earth and contacted humans. However, I do not much believe the supposed evidence which is alleged to prove their existence. Even if aliens have visited Earth or contacted humans, their nature is so otherworldly that it would be impossible to distinguish such a phenomenon from mere hallucination. There are some genuine unidentified flying objects which I think could be aliens, but again, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to declare that they are aliens. I do not believe the evidence should be dismissed outright, only that it should be viewed as ambiguous and ultimately inconclusive. However, I am not here to argue over this.

I think there is a dangerous side to wild speculation about aliens. Aliens may be used to form ""counter-conspiracies"" - that is, ""fake"" conspiracy theories created to distract from the truth. Look at Area 51, for example. The alien conspiracy theories draw away from its true function as an experimental weapons testing center. The US government could be spying on us or planning to bomb us with every manner of experimental satellite and people might think instead of aliens when they observe such things in the sky. Thus the government can then quietly admit the existence of these experimental weapons programs and conspiratorial types may think they are clever for ignoring this and focusing instead on the ""real"" story - the alien counter-conspiracy. Similarly, alien conspiracy theorists wind up chasing after some esoteric shadow order as opposed to the real power elites in society. The powerful can perpetuate stereotypes of these alien-lizardmen-illuminati type conspiracy theorists to associate anyone skeptical of the status quo with crackpots and to subtly sway the skeptical towards such crackpot theories. This serves as a counter-conspiracy because it ultimately strengthens the position of the elite. 

Theories about aliens having constructed the pyramids or the Easter Island statues can also serve as counter-conspiracies as they erase the history of the people who constructed them and thus unintentionally help to perpetuate racist narratives. People also say this about Stonehenge, so I can't say it's always racist, but regardless it still disrespects the ingenuity and resourcefulness of humanity - not to mention that it's totally false.

aliens,"Conclusion from paper:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Exciting as an extraterrestrial visitation to earth would be, this paper has pointed out that in the current state of our knowledge UFO phenomena are not consistent with the common interpretation of this hypothesis. Neither do the observed patterns support the theory that all UFOs can be explained as combinations of natural effects, or as psycho-sociological processes. Therefore it is proposed that future research in this field could fruitfully explore alternative hypotheses, such as those involving either natural or artificial control systems, earth lights or wormhole travel. The arguments raised here are not intended as a complete refutation of the ETH or the natural phenomena hypothesis. Until the nature and origin of UFO phenomena can be firmly established it will naturally be possible to hypothesize that extraterrestrial factors, including undiscovered forms of consciousness, are playing a role in its manifestations. But any future theory should constructively address the facts we have reviewed. At a minimum, the idea of extraterrestrial intervention should be updated to include current theoretical speculation about other models of the physical universe.

He was drinking something from a can that didn’t have a label, and when he saw me he choked and spit it out a bit. I didn’t know what to do so I just stared at him.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I may play Devil's Advocate here, I don't think the halting of release is anything so sinister. Hear me out.

We're already on a path of slow disclosure by some of the world's governments. including the U.S. and the U.K.. Only, all the media files they've released by far have been not great. There's a reason for that. It's a giant game of Follow the Leader, in a sense. With the admissions from the Pentagon, the TTSA series Unidentified, The Phenomenon, potential microbial life in Venus' atmosphere etc. over the past three years, they're slowly dipping our toes into the disclosure pool. Heck, it's why Tucker Carlson has been pushing it as much as he has lately, to reach the most stubborn, unbelieving audience, the Evangelical Conservative group. If you look at all the releases, how they're times, which markets they're reaching, it's a puzzle slowly being formed with pieces dropping here and there. The whole picture will emerge sooner than later, because it has to. Private industry and corporate interests are chomping at the bit toget in on the ground floor of whatever tech is coming, stuff we've reverse engineered. Look at the TR-3A Aurora and TR-3B Astra, both have been in use for quite some time. The military is dying to roll these out to the mass military industrial complex. Other governments in the know are likely ready to start a proxy bidding war for their right to own these fantastic machines. But revealing where the tech came from? That's the problem. They have to get humanity used to the idea of confirmed extraterrestial life, to minimize chaos and confusion around the globe. And once that cork pops, a lot of questions, hard questions, are going to be asked.

""How long did you know and keep it secret?""

""What else aren't you telling us?""

""Are we in danger? Are aliens preparing to attack?""

""Where did they come from? Are they cousins? Friends? Enemies? have they always been here?""

The list goes on and on. So before a new age of industry, commercial and otherwise, can begin, they HAVE to reveal at least a rough outline of the truth. And therein lies the problem.

Remember what I said about it being a game of Follow The Leader? That's what the world governments are doing: Waiting for the U.S. to make the big leap into the deep end. As these photos, if you believe Nick Pope, are as clear, concise and undeniable as he says, it would entain the U.K. making the first technical move. And as he himself stated, I believe, the majority of the British populace is a LOT harder to accept change than even the staunchest Republican or Christian. When they set the original release date, they were expecting us to be through this process already. Disclosure should have happened by now, if you look at the expiration date on a LOT of FOIA released documents. It was planned for a while back, so the private sector could start making use of the tech. But until we get a much broader, fuller disclosure, they can't afford for truly authentic, clear, high resolution pictures and video to be released. This new date doesn't mean it's going to be another fifty years. Think of it more like when Mickey Mouse's trademark was set to expire. Disney got a renewal of it against the norm, because of how iconic he is and his monetary value. This renewal by the Brits isn't meant to keep us in the dark forever. It's meant to keep it at the ready, for when the U.S. makes the big jump. Only then will they release the higher-grade materials. I expect to see these pics, personally, within three to five years. We're almost ready.

Almost.

However, there was this one time some 17 years ago when my drunken father began shaking me on my bed trying to wake me up. ""Get up! You need to see this! Now! I've seen an alien!"" he said and I being an edgy and angry teenager woke up ready and willing to disprove everything he have seen with cold hard science. I was literally primed to find even the faintest evidence of him being wrong and immediately return to bed.  


So we get out in to the cold snowy winter and the story goes like this. As usually my father was at his favorite pub, when finally he managed to annoy everyone in there to the point where nobody would sit with him. That's when his new victim entered the pub. A good looking, blonde, short hair, normal body, decently, not too heavy dressed guy with some snow on him because it was densely snowing outside. Nothing extra special, but my father have never seen him there. Guy took an empty table and my father have invited himself to sit there as well.  


From up close that guy also looked normal, except one detail. His eyebrows would sparkle, but dad thought nothing of  since he thought it's just melted snow. So the two break in to conversation and after a while my father knows that man is not a local, found a job somewhere around and made 400CZK that week. Guy seemed happy about his accomplishment. Now to clarify, in Czechia you want to make some 200CZK an hour to have decent wage. So what he made in a week is deep under the minimum wage limit. So they talk for about two hours about various things when it finally stops snowing. My father have noticed guys eyebrows still sparkle, despite the room being heated to some 20C. That guy pays his bill and takes off on to the night. My father now sure that guy is weird pays his own bill and follows him five minutes later.  


He's got an easy job. It stopped snowing and barely anybody took off in to the night at that time. Sky have almost cleared. He followed the footprints towards the park, then they suddenly turn off road in to the park, across our water clock, towards our house, under the massive tree that grows there. His track pristinely  copies my path when I'm returning home from school. Then, just six meters away from our back door, under a clear sky a little spiral of footprints, one just half imprinted in to the snow, the guy was gone.  


That's where I come in. Wearing light shoes, sleepy, I look at the pattern, I examine the shoe prints. Sneakers, not very grippy, fairly normal size, smaller than mine, very far from each other. Either the guy had long legs or was running. I stand close by the spiral, just five or six shoe prints, I look up. No branches, ropes, cables, poles, nothing. Small clouds are racing across the starry sky as wind is brutal in high altitudes. Hot air balloon? Impossible, too windy. Helicopter? Definitely no, the snow would have gotten beaten to hell. I look closely at the spiral, last footprint is light, he didn't jump. It looks like somebody have lifted him or he lifted himself. I look at my father, no way. He does measure some solid 198cm, but his spine would shatter even under my weight. And I was underweight that time. So I look around, it doesn't look like the guy climbed on to somebody's back, corresponding shoe prints are missing. Tree nearby is empty and far, our roof is empty and too far. I wake up, begin to make circles, two meters, six meters, twelve meters, no appropriate tire prints. Closest to match are thirty meters far. You Ain't gonna pack this large crane in five minutes. I return back and all I can do is slap my pockets. Only other footprints there are my fathers gigantic 48 and my own quite large 45 shoes. Everything else is too far from this point. Last chance, I examine the track going towards the place. It's not imprinted twice, nothing that would suggest it's a prank and the guy just went backwards. Also, hell of a distance to backtrack, all the way to the road, some fifty meters.  


I have learned much more science and technology since then, but I still don't have an answer to where the hell that guy went. Sadly, we didn't have a camera back then. 17 years ago a phone was really just a brick that would make phone calls and send texts. From what I can tell, man went straight up and softly. Straight up in sneakers, relatively light clothing and less than 400CZK in his pocket. Was he an alien? A time traveler? Secret government researcher? I guess I'll never know.",That one time my father have talked to... an actual alien?
aliens,"I have come to wonder what would happen if we started hearing certain names of things being said by government officials. Say for example that the planet aliens who are contacting us are from planet NP65 or something. I know it's stupid but I am too tired to invent anything better so please just bare with me. What if we start seeing planet NP65 be discussed from time to time and people will be able to say it sounds familiar in conversation? What if from there, more casual discussions in government start happening regarding this planet to where the average person can tell you that they've heard of it and roughly know what it is? What if from there we get more and more info until it's revealed that NP65 is where aliens are from?

I don't know, but it just seems odd that despite all the sightings and video or photo evidence that we have yet to get some kind of placeholder species name yet to theorize over yet. I know we have ""alien gray"", but I doubt the real species would call themselves grays like we call ourselves humans and that no means of a species name has leaked out yet, if that makes sense.
If I am unaware of something, I apologize and ask that you please be patient and nice when educating me on a subject ^^'.",Would a species or planet name be a hint of aliens being revealed?

If you watch my video on my spiritual awakening experience you will understand the truth about Aliens in a much deeper and complex way than you ever have before. 

There was a point during my truth seeking journey where I had a profound spiritual awakening. I suddenly understood who I was and understood my connection to creation itself. This post is aimed at people who believe in the paranormal, supernatural, aliens or mysteries of life who want answers. 

**I CAN GIVE YOU THOSE ANSWERS - ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WATCH THE VIDEO**

You may have a deep understanding of the physical conspiracy on planet earth but you are yet to fully wake up and understand the true extent of the spiritual conspiracy on planet earth. The physical conspiracy controllers (humans) work in conjunction with the spiritual conspiracy controllers (negative entities, alien, extra terrestrials) to conquer the planet and enslave the human race.

Watch my video where I connect all the dots and show you how conspiracy information, spirituality, extraterrestrials, star seeds and Jesus Christ are all connected: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trqJ1Ka9WFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trqJ1Ka9WFY)

I can prove the following 3 things: 

**ALIENS ARE REAL** 

**I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM** 

**THERE ARE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ALIENS. THE GOOD GUYS WANT TO HELP HUMANITY. THE BAD GUYS WANT TO DESTROY HUMANITY**

Just give the video at least 5 minutes... Im sure you will continue to watch.

Some things I talk about in the video: extraterrestrials involved on planet earth, god, secret space programme, consciousness, Ley lines, true history or earth, the astral plane, lucid dreaming, start seeds, humanities true origin and cosmic heritage and Jesus.

Calling reports of abductions subjective ignores facts - people are frequently returned to where they were taken wearing others' clothing. People are returned to the wrong place, like a neighbors home.  One woman was dropped off naked in the snow it night in a woodlot three miles from here home. And so on. These are infrequent but not unusual features of the many thousands of abduction accounts. 

Calling these experiences subjective is arrogant and avoidance and ignores the fact we don't have a perfect understanding of physics, matter, or energy. How do the grays pass through walls, bringing the abductee with them? Clearly they understand how to manipulate matter as energy, which is what it is. 

The others don't want us to get accustomed to the idea of their presence without understanding what they are doing and why, and what we should be doing about it, they encourage this kind of thinking and encourage us to repeat and support ideas like ""we don;t know"" ""it's a subjective experience"" and so on.

aliens,"I looked into the cattle mutilation phenomenon last night and thought to myself why are they only going after cattle in the US so I looked into animal mutilations globally because I remember the stories of the chupacabra that sucked the blood out of chickens and goats.  Turns out in France theres a very new phenomenon going down thats very similar to cattle mutilations except they are horse mutilations occurring all over France within the last year. They are missing blood, eyes, ears, reproductive organs, etc. and all occurred since 2020.

Which leads me to a second thought. France is surrounded by other countries but i only found the horse mutilations occurring in France which tells me either people aren’t reporting it in other countries or that the ufos know country borders. With the cattle mutilations in the US you couldn’t say that they understand borders because the US spans from coast to coast. But when its also happening in France and only France and no other surrounding counties it makes me think they are aware of country borders.

Ufos are seen around cattle mutilations frequently so thats why I believe they are also mutilating other animals around the world in similar ways people just aren’t noticing them as much. Im not sure why they are doing this to animals but Id love to hear other 
thoughts on this and hope this info gets looked into more by other people.",Its not just cattle mutilations. More animals are getting mutilated than we realize. Its a big piece of information people aren’t looking into
aliens,"First off, if posts like this are not allowed then I apologize. 

But I figured I’d share this dream I had here. I don’t remember this dream much, but I vividly remember how I felt in it. So in the dream it’s late at night and I’m walking down a main road that intersects with the street that I live on. Its a quiet night. No wind blowing, no crickets chirping. It’s also a clear night with no clouds and a bright moon lighting up the night. When I get to the intersection I had the feeling that I should look up. And when I did, I saw this massive object close to the ground. You could’ve thrown a rock at it that’s how close it was. I don’t really know how to describe the object, it had such an odd shape. I’d say that it sort of resembled a submarine or a warship but not quite like it though. Kind of like an oval type of shape with a bunch of appendages and spikes sticking out of it. It was dark grey in color. This thing made absolutely no sound and just sat there in there without moving at all. I remember just frozen, standing there looking at it. It was the most ominous feeling I’ve felt. I remember it being so quiet and my mind being so overwhelmed with curiosity that I couldn’t even say wtf out loud. I must’ve been looking at this thing for a little over a minute. After that, I started to walk underneath it to get a closer look. Then when I did that this thing just fell. Fell right out of the sky with still no sound. It’s like someone flipped the gravity switch on. It crashed to the ground right at the intersection. I then slowly started circling it carefully. And oddly enough… people were coming out of it. They seemed thrilled and happy even though this ship just crashed. I remember trying to talk to them but don’t remember what was said. I think that was the end of the dream. Can’t really remember.

How my subconscious mind came up with an object like that is beyond me. I imagine how I felt in this dream would be how I would feel if I actually saw a UFO. I’ll never forget the feeling I had in that dream. Every time I cross this intersection now I think about this dream, especially at night. I even look up at the exact spot in the sky because you never know…

aliens,"So, I was thinking lately about how our governments have access to all the media, being able to control people's opinion about various topics, etc. Having that ability, I don't think it would be impossible to spin the narrative in the direction I'm gonna present below.

We all want full disclosure on this subreddit, right?

But what if, after all the steps forward we have taken within the last few years, we'd be finally presented with something that's the opposite of disclosure?

The scenario is: 

Within a couple of years after the preliminary report, the narrative is spun around in the direction of the ""phenomenon"" being a naturally occurring event caused by whatever fits (idk, maybe some new science theory regarding dark matter, plasma, other dimensions). This explanation would be of course, backed up with ""legit"" data done by the debunkers of scientific community. Imo just the fact that they changed the term UFO to UAP fits in with this theory, as the term ""phenomenon"" is much more vague. Abduction cases can be easily thrown in the ""hallucination"" bin.

The rest of the world accepts this explanation without thinking too much about it, as we will have much more serious problems on the table like climate change, wealth transfer, deepening social polarization, all that fun jazz. The topic will be thrown into the depths of oblivion, never to be talked about again, as the explanation will be right there to be pointed at, with all the nice-looking professional graphs, calculations and a comforting smile saying ""don't worry, everything is just as it was, you don't need to ask those hard questions anymore!""

I forgot the exact details but I do remember in the blue book they gave it the status of a unidentified object. So if two government stories match each other both representing a white tiktac shape 30 years apart creates a form of evidence toward these ufos.

aliens,"Just read an article about some scientists theorize the universe expands (like it is now) until it reaches a point to where it starts contracting down to a single point (basically we all get consumed by black holes) then bang, the Big Bang happens and the process restarts. They say this has been happening over and over again forever and one cycle takes like ~60-100 billion years. 

My thoughts go back to something I’ve heard over and over again…Modern humans have been around for an unfathomably small amount of time compared to the age of the earth, sun, universe etc. Well let’s say we survive for the 50-100 billion years and the universe restarts. By then we may have unfathomable technology and could possibly survive the Big Bang?

aliens,"Grey aliens are usually depicted as white beings with large black eyes that can levitate. This picture is a 4000 year old painting from Aboriginals.

[Aboriginal Wandjina spirits.](https://preview.redd.it/vypjrx776em71.jpg?width=1131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c7f0ac5c1e99d018e64ec3f0c1f3864dfce14e6)

When somebody gets abducted they lift in the air with their arms and legs down, it's also similar to a possession when they levitate of a bed.

A famous abduction researcher **(Dr. David Jacobs)** put during the 80's a camera in an abductees house and she destroyed it while sleepwalking without remembering, after a hypnotic session she claimed to be abducted and didn't know why she destroyed the camera. 

 Let's talk about abductions where people say they were paralyzed and unable to move. Some Doctors want to associate Alien abductions with Sleep paralysis but that can be dismissed, abductions happen also during daytime.

A guy **(David Huggins)** claimed he got abducted since he was a child, when he reached puberty age of 17 he met an **(hybrid looking alien called Crescent)** he had sexual intercourse with. She laid on top of him and he was completely paralyzed. He Remembered they also took his seed and created 100's of hybrid babies with more of these hybrid alien looking beings. 

[ Crescent is an Hybrid alien with a white alien face, wearing a wig, has a beautiful human body with long black lizard nails according David Huggins. ](https://preview.redd.it/mbo3cowu6em71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e52083c69b7d255f282d9fdabf9aa622b119cf01)

 I recommend to watch his Documentary **(Love &amp; Saucers).** He is a painter and painted most of his encounters, it's a dead giveaway to me of what aliens are. 

If you look on Wikipedia for [sleep paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis), it mentions that in the Bible it talks about a [(Succubus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus) female that lay on top of you in your sleep while you are paralyzed.   
It can be a beautiful girl but closer inspection they show deformities like black bird like claws, serpent tails, exactly like a ghost and they impregnate themselves with your seed to create more Succubus beings or to kill the babies. 

Look at this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/ph71ai/aliens_according_credited_abductions_ancient_gods/) where Aliens are related to fallen angels and Ancient Gods. Hybrids further relate to Demonic beings that are beings with black eyes.

In David Huggins Documentary or in an interview he explained some of his hybrid children came to him and told we got new bodies with the help of the insect guy, **(Mantoids)** they are considered in charge of the grey aliens according allot of abduction researches. 

[ David Huggin's babies with a Mantoid.](https://preview.redd.it/5kah33jjaem71.jpg?width=2872&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=463f4e2340cd0c059efb75a634e32c3142b0005f)

 Succubus beings sacrifice some of the hybrid babies so other spirits can escape Hell in return and enter any bio engineered body to create more hybrid offspring's, this is why people report other creature sightings like **(Bigfoot)**, **(Mothmen)**, **(Dogmen)**, **(Black eyed children)**, **(Greys)** and more Hybrid or **(Mythical creatures)** that are biologically engineered by Ancient Gods or the Fallen angels.

Demons are locked in a **(Hell Dimension)**, an offer is a trade deal, when you die a portal opens which happens in **(Near death experiences)**. With a trade deal, a demon's soul has free play to enter another dimension and releases his spirit which we see as UFO Light orbs, it requires a death process, is what makes them inter dimensional.

I have several questions but the biggest one that I have is, why did the aliens give humanity alien technology to fix the earth under the promise that the government would disclose to the people of earth their existence within a certain time frame and they made this deal without telling the humans that if they didn't follow through that there would be some form of consequence from the aliens? Like coming and repossessing the technology and send humanity back to the dark ages.   It definitely seems like the government saw that at the time the deal was made because they made no effort to use the technology for it's intended purpose and instead they took it to make weapons and to make money.  With the aliens having the ability to traverse time wouldn't they have know this is what humans would do?   I understand that the aliens respect the fact that the earth is ours and maybe that is why they decided not to have a consequence and that it will be humanity that has to deal with the consequence of a dying planet.  

What has also been interesting for me after reading this book is seeing all the news about UFO activity and hearing that the government is finally acknowledging to the public the possibility of an advanced species coming to earth, the US putting together the Space Force last year it definitely feels like we are about to be threatened.  I have seen videos (I know it anecdotal) on Tic Tok about a person claiming to be a time traveler and saying that a species is coming to earth on 9/11 to take 4000 humans and relocate them to the plane Proxima B because another hostile species will be coming to Earth soon.

First off he is obviously a very intelligent, rational man.  I fully believe skeptics are needed in this area especially, and he has done some good.  

After listening to him for an hour and a half though he comes off as so ""rational"" that he's completely biased at this point.  His own opinion of his intelligence is way out of order.  He's certain he can learn something complex like a FLIR system in a month to a better understand than people who worked on it.  If he can't find a way to explain something, he says the other person does not understand his point.  

(Paraphrasing but very close quote)  
&gt;Mick:  ""Yes I talked with Fravor.  Even after explaining to him why he probably did not see what he thought he saw, he still thinks he saw it.  He doesn't understand my argument at all.""  
  

I was listening to the podcast while going to bed, and at some point past 20 minutes I actually just had to get up because I was so frustrated with what I was hearing.  

I'm sure a lot of you remember that video of like one of the guys who designed the FLIR device (or of similar authority) basically debunking Mick West's debunk.  I can't find a link but I'm sure someone has it, if you'd post it please.  

Mick comes away from that saying, (again paraphrasing but close); ""Yes he's an expert, but he doesn't really know much about FLIR.  In the end he never understood my point.  When I ask people what his answer was they don't understand or know, but they understand my explanation.""  

First, I can't remember who made that video but it was some type of guy who FOR SURE knows 1000% more about the FLIR system than Mick learned in a couple months.  

Mick is basing all of his science off of video game geometry he learned early on and a book on how to solve a general math problem from the 70's.  (He flat out says this is his expertise and methodology)  He still has the balls to say he understands the FLIR system to a degree the designer couldn't understand his point.  I don't understand how he can justify saying things like this to himself and think he's still acting without bias.  

Secondly, does it not make sense that the average person wouldn't be able to recite the specific features of a high tech device which they heard from a professional, but can easily repeat some basic and over simplified explanation from Mick?  He's using that as an argument FOR himself when it seems against him, to me.  

He said that in his conversation with Lue that ultimately, again Lue did not understand the point he was making when actually if you had heard that podcast already Mick completely missed the point.  ""At least Lue listened to me"", hearing Mick's interpretation is kinda funny because The Zondo is extremely polite and was humoring him after having explained why he was wrong and that there was other data which would prove that but he could not reveal.  

The number of times when someone questions his answers and he replies with ""they don't understand the point"", when they clearly do is frustrating because I don't know if Mick is just deflecting; or if he really is under the impression if he's wrong it's because the other party misunderstands.  

It's also quite clear there is no room in his mind for ""The phenomenon"" being anything more than something boring and mundane.  He'll reluctantly say ""can't rule aliens out"" once or twice but he doesn't consider it possible at all.  He thinks the classified report literally consists of nothing more than ""plastic bags in the air, birds, drones, balloons, some weather we don't know enough about"".  

This ain't a thread to pile on him or anything.  I just honestly thought he was acting in good faith all along, and he THINKS he is but the contradictions he has to come up with to align certain things, it just doesn't add up.  The list of contrivances he put together for example to write all parts of the Nimitz incident off was almost a more absurd answer than: ""there was a real object there just like fravor said"".   

I had never listened to him in depth before now, and I certainly understand the ire towards him.  

When he started going on about how Fravor was mistaken about what he saw, I had to go BS and just stop it for a bit and then come back.  Only to hear next about how the guy who built the FLIR doesn't understand what Mick means by glare...    

This guy thinks way to highly of himself and does not have half the required education to be making the type of statements he does on a lot of subjects.  

I was cool with him when I thought he was trying to weed out the crap to find the gems.  Now that I know that even after talking with people who know better, he completely writes off all known evidence, with sometimes very half assed explanations...  

Well this guy, he ain't my kinda guy.","New ""Somewhere in the Skies"" podcast with Mick West. First time hearing him long form and I gotta rant a bit."

&gt; Do you also believe in the law of balance and karma,allowing a soul to be king in one lifetime,a beggar in the next?

&gt; *Insider:*
&gt; 
&gt; What you are talking about (reincarnating into the opposite of your former life), there is no universal law which states that will definitely happen.  
&gt; Reincarnation is a fact though, but if you achieve your task there is no reincarnation, no need to experience all levels of life on Earth for they are mainly pointless to experience.
&gt;

&gt; *GLP user:*
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you choose to speak Now?
&gt; 
&gt; *Insider:*
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us have the task to do it within certain boundaries.  
&gt; How do you suppose certain knowledge in past times was suddenly there?  
&gt; Luck, chance, coincidence?
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The physical realm is weak and it cannot affect the Divine.

**[Hidden Hand (2008)](https://web.archive.org/web/20111103072651/http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html)**

&gt; If it is not in the mainstream controlled media, it will not be believed by the masses. This is information tailored for those who already know that we are very real, and exerting a strong, if mostly subtle, influence over your lives.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; You will never be 'free', for as long as you are incarnating on this planet. The very nature of your being here, is indication of that. There is a reason why you are here, and 'here' is very likely not really where you think 'here' is. How do you become free? By working out where you are, and coming to an understanding, of why you are here. You are fast running out of time to do so, before the coming Harvest. Those that don't make it, will have to repeat the cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **I am prepared to give you some things coming down the timeline, that you will be able to look back upon, and verify my predictions retrospectively.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Let's see if we can increase the 'depth' of enquiry and question matter in the next session. Seek beyond the superficial. Get to the 'Core' of the matter.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Let's be clear about one thing though. All of this (physical life / incarnation), is a very intricate and skillfully designed Game, whereby the One Infinite Creator, plays the game of forgetting who It is, so that It can learn to remember, and in doing so, experience and know Itself as Creator. All the way down to us tiny individuated sparks of the All That Is. Off stage, and between ""Lives"" (zero-point time / anti-matter Universe) as incarnated ""human beings"", we, all of us / you (as Souls), are great friends.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Can you elaborate on the ""coming harvest"" and what exactly you mean by harvest?
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; I can.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **The higher the quality of the question, the more depth I can give to my answer. It all has to do with the Laws of Confusion and Free Will.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **As for the question of can I elaborate on the coming Harvest, yes, I shall do so now.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Smaller Cycles yield a Harvest, and then life continues on the planet as normal. Great Cycles yield a Great Harvest, and the end of current life on the 3rd Density. See it as a kind of 'Cosmic jet wash' and deep clean, while the planet takes a rest and regenerates herself.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; the planet will complete it's Ascension to the Fourth Density, the vibrational Density of Love. During this Ascension, there will be a three way split for those Souls inhabiting Earth.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; For the majority of Humans on the earth who could be considered shall we say ""luke warm"", they will experience a period of (what will feel 'ecstatic') zero-point time, where you feel totally at One with The Creator, giving you an encouraging reminder and glimpse of who you really are, before the veil of forgetfulness once again descends upon you, and you will be transported to another 3rd Density planet (a kind of 'Earth Replica'), to continue working upon yourselves and learning that life here is all about making choices. You will remain ""quarantined"" incarnating in 3rd Density matter until the time of the next Harvest; in which time you will need to have proved yourselves that you have learned how to be more Positive Beings, focused more upon being of Service to others, rather than seeking only to Serve yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; As for ""fighting for the freedom of all souls"", remember that ultimately, this is a Game, that we are all playing here. We are actors, playing on the ""stage of Life"". This 'world' is all illusion, or 'though-form'. No one really ""dies"", and no one is really hurt. In between incarnations, you know this very well. But the rules of the game ensure that you must forget who you really are, so that you believe it is all 'real' whilst you are playing the game of Life. That is an essential prerequisite when you are making choices. Otherwise, the game would be too easy.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; It is my understanding that all souls must eventually choose the positive path to unite with the infinite creator. If this is true, what is the justification of choosing the negative path now, for your people and us?
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; An astute question. Yes, all Souls eventually learn that Positive is the pathway which leads Home. But whilst incarnating in the 3rd Density, Negativity is still an important tool in your learning process. It teaches you ""other than"". As I said earlier, it is up to you how you use the tools we have given you. Do you respond to Negativity with more Negativity? Has fighting fire with fire ever worked for you? Or do you choose to see the Negativity as the tool that it is, and recognize that it is offering you an opportunity? I will honour your Free Will to think and discover for yourself what that opportunity is.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; This is a hoax.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; Your disbelief is of no consequence to me. Only to you.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; I also read through the above link from one calling themselves 'The Insider', although his / her posts were less sophisticated than yours. Was he your predecessor? One of your ilk charged with this 'disclosure'?
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; A good question. I have just read through that material. It was very interesting. No, not a 'predecessor of mine', and not a disclosure I was previously aware of, which had it come from my Family, would be highly strange. Though, I note that he himself stated that he is ""from a minority"", and certain clues within his writing gives me a very good idea which one.
&gt; 
&gt; I would say his material is around 60% accurate. The feelings I get from reading him, are not that he intentionally included inaccurate information, but that he was just not in possession of the ""bigger picture"". Were he to be from the ""minority"" group I believe him to be from, that would make perfect sense.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; **So when the Harvest comes, my time here is over and this conscious shell I live in is no more, what then? What happens to me? What happens to my friends and loved ones? Are we, and by we, I mean the vast vast majority of us who possess this planet, this dimension, this density, by and large going to be ignorant of the events you foretell?**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; For those who do not physically ""die"" before the Great Harvest arrives, there will be a moment of ""zero-point time"", where you will enjoy an ecstatic merging with the Infinite Creator, giving you a wonderful reminder and reassurance of who and what you really are, before the veil of forgetfulness once again descends upon you, and you will be transported to the place that awaits you, depending upon whether you join us in 4th Density Negative (unlikely), Graduate to 4th Density Positive (possible), or go to another similar 3rd Density planet (for the ""luke-warms"") to continue in your learning for however many Cycles it takes you to Graduate to 4th Density Positive. Those in this category will not remember anything at the time of your transition, it will be just like nothing has changed, except you will retain the memory of your ""zero-point"" experience to encourage you. You will not remember the recent experiences of the Harvest in this life here. It just be as though you all had some mystical experience, and life will continue as 'normal' for you.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Your Soul remembers everything you've ever experienced. The only reason you don't remember it all now, is due to what we term the ""veil of forgetfulness"". If you came into each new incarnation with access to your Soul memory, there's no point in your coming into space/time. It would be like playing a computer game with all the cheats. You wouldn't learn anything, and it takes the fun out of playing the game. Remember that this current physical body you carry around with you, is not who you are. It's just the vessel for your essence. Who you are, is Real, and cannot be destroyed.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; And you will indeed meet with us, back stage, once the game is over. When you see us ""out of costume"" you will recognize us as your age old friends.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; We wish you well upon your journey, and look forward to seeing you at the ""aftershow"" party.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; **I'm still not clear on what this harvest is. A ""harvest"" means to reap what has been sown - by you!**
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; Not by us. We did not sow, our Infinite Creator did. We do not reap, our Infinite Creator does.
&gt; 
&gt; We help to prepare the Harvest, by separating the wheat from the chaff, for want of a more eloquent metaphor.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Your purpose in the Game, is to work upon yourself. To grow, develop, and transform yourself into a more positive and loving being. You had certain goals that you planned to achieve before incarnating here, which is a main reason for the veil of forgetfulness being in place, because if you already knew what your goals were, the Game would be too easy.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The Harvest is Mixed. Those who are 51% or over on the Positive path will Graduate to 4th Density Positive. There you will work upon Love and Compassion, and it will be a very beautiful world to reside within for you. There will be very little negativity. Just a small enough amount that you can still use it to exercise your Free Will in choosing who you are not, but it will be so much more obvious than it is here, that the negativity is a tool to be used. You will see the interconnectedness of all things, and you will know that you are not 'separate' from one another, or from life Itself. You will not use words much, unless you choose to. Telepathy becomes the normal method of communication. Everything is open, and you cannot hide your thoughts from 'others'.
&gt; 
&gt; From that incarnation onwards, you will not have to experience 3rd Density incarnation again, unless you later choose to do so from Higher Densities, as we have done, in order to perfect the art of Service, or unless you somehow, in a 4th Density world of abundant love and beauty, inextricably manage to be 95% Negative at a time of future Harvest, and slide back down the snake, instead of ascending up the ladder, to use another 'Game' metaphor.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; **You said that the ""lukewarm people"" at the time of harvest would not notice anything has happened, but they'd be on a different planet. Do you mean that they'd wake up with no memory of what has occurred but still be in the same physical body, or they'd wake up in a new physical body with no memory of any past life?**
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; There will be a short experience of 'zero-point time', where you feel utterly ""at One"" with your Infinite Creator. It will be a feeling of blissful, ecstatic expansiveness and Unity, whilst your physical vehicles (bodies) are dissolved back into Light, and transported to your new environment. When that transition is complete, the 'zero-point time' will end, and you will 'appear' in your new 'game-zone' (planet). You will look the same, think the same, feel the same, in fact, it will be just like you all had some mystical experience, and life will carry on as 'normal' for you. Same houses, family situations, jobs, friends, lovers. Everything will seem the same as before, you will not remember the Great Harvest or earth changes that occurred as the planet Earth heals and regenerates herself. But you will recall your 'mystical experience' and that will give you hope and a new opportunity to choose a more positive future for yourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; There will still be the same Negative Polarity to overcome, but if we are successful in our Negative Graduation, (which we shall be) others are standing by to take our places pulling the strings from ""behind the scenes"".
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I was reluctant to be the one tasked with this communication. I still very much have a 'weakness' for Compassion. But I obey and discharge the assignments given to me. It has been a very long time, since I last spent any time in having direct dealings with 'your kind' in general. I do not mean that in an offensive way, just that the vast majority of my time, I only ever see Family during my daily and nightly tasks. I do not live what you would call a 'public' life. I am 'sheltered' and 'secluded'.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I was chosen because it was desired that someone of my ""diplomacy"" skills would be best to deliver this message. Due to the very nature of the subject matter, there was much potential for discord. It was felt important that the message did not become lost in a self righteous or defensive delivery system. So, you got me. And I'm actually glad now in retrospect that you did.
&gt; 
&gt; I sit here and chuckle to myself, (in light of the way some people here have spoken to me), how this discourse may have descended into something ugly, were certain others amongst my Family who were also considered for this assignment to have actually been given the job. Now I know why I was chosen. As with all things, it was meant to be this way.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Reptilians are described as being very aggressive, arrogant and perceive humans to be nothing more than cattle. So what's with the split personalities? you're saying you are loving and spiritual and yet everyone says reptilians are fearsome beings?
&gt; 
&gt; *Hidden Hand:*
&gt; 
&gt; That amuses us. We are most certainly NOT Reptilian, and there is nothing remotely reptilian about the True Power Bloodlines.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; and when all is said and done, no matter how much one may have suffered in this life-experience, we can never lose sight of the fact that this is a Game we are all playing here together, and each incarnating Soul has already chosen and agreed in advance the parts they will play in the Game. No one really suffers, except in the Game, and ultimately, they have chosen these experiences before hand, at a Soul level. No one is 'forced' to incarnate into a storyline they do not want to play and learn from.

&gt; In the earlier part of his dialogue “Hidden Hand” made grave errors in what he told you, he “talked too much”.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I am not a hoaxer.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I am not “Hidden Hand” and I would never even dream of making the mistakes that he did.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, “Hidden Hand” was who he said he was, there should be no mistake about it. Now, I have read his discourse with this site and it was very honest and a pretty good piece of work. But, to my suprise, I noticed that he told you people way more than he was supposed to and I was not the only one to notice.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The one who were overseeing the discourse between him and this site read what he wrote and automatically knew that he had broken the Law of Free Will. How did he break it? Well, he went into too much detail when answering the questions. Not only that, but he answered questions that nobody even asked and that is not a wise thing to do. There are consequences for breaking The Laws, and they are pretty harsh if you ask me.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; A catalyst will always be needed as long as their are souls who need to be developed. There is no other way around it.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; I am not in the habit of lying, and I have not lied to anyone on this website.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Is what he said true? So we know not to ask the same questions.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; The core of what he said was true and that really is all you should be concerned with.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; **it was previously stated by HH that the harvest will propel humankind into the 4th dimension, if that is the case, how do you explain the fact that people are believing we’re headed to the 5th.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; not all of “humankind” will be going anywhere, infact most of you will be staying in this dimension. As for people believing they are going to the 5th, they are misinformed. Nobody skips a level.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Could I terminate my existance.. wouldn’t that be fair, couldn’t “God” give me that opportunity? Couldn’t he destroy me forever and ever?  
&gt;  Basically what I’m asking is:  
&gt; Am I under a contract that I can’t break? Am I TRAPPED in existance?  
&gt;  In this miserable, utterly hopeless existance, this hell.
&gt; 
&gt; Couldn’t I just say: I’m done playing, I don’t want this, I don’t want this life, I don’t want an afterlife, I don’t wanna reincarnate, I don’t wanna move to another “density”.. I don’t wanna exist in any way, shape or form.  
&gt;  Wouldn’t that be my right if I wanted to, to not exist?
&gt; 
&gt; I’m pretty much done with this life already, been burned out for years.. this “game” is played out.. and my conscious self never signed no deal.  
&gt;  I want out.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t see the purpose of this spiritual rat race anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a “spiritual rat race”, take as long as you need.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; In your opinion, What is meant by higher self, if “a part”of us resides with the source then why do we send of a part of our soul to earth to learn all over again.
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the challenge and the desire to “prove oneself”. You are, in all acutality, “playing” a “game” with yourself and eventually you will win.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Are you implying that those bloodlines are not reptilian?
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; Not only do I mean to imply that, I will state it directly: The Bloodline are not reptilian.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; **who will accompany the ‘lukewarms’ and provide them with the cataylst while they repeat the cycle?**
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; Does it matter? You most likely won’t even notice the switch anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Can we as human beings of the planet Earth claim it as ours?
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; Claim whatever you like, but that won’t make it true
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; How would a person know that they have accomplished all their lessons for this cycle?
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; You wouldnt know until after you “died” or until the Great Harvest comes.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; Is it logical to assume that a human living on earth during this time has been reincarnating as a human onto earth for quite a while now because he/she has still not learned the lessons necessary to ascend to a fourth density?
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; *ATS member:*
&gt; 
&gt; H_H talked about the “Great Harvest” coming soon. Is this the only time we “souls” are able to “move up the ladder” or is it possible after every death?
&gt; 
&gt; *Illuminator13:*
&gt; 
&gt; No, but if you miss the Harvest it will be “harder”.

**[Sagittarius Earth](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/diyh5u/mandela_effect_summary_with_links/)**

&gt; In July 2019, I felt my heart beating at the center of my chest for the first time in my life. This was before I knew about any of the hardcore Mandela Effect stuff, so I completely blew off the incident (I thought it was a strange occurrence, but by no means did I dwell upon it or deem it to be a supernatural event).
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, my [consciousness was transferred](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d7g6br/mandela_effect_some_christians_erroneously/f0zo8xe/) from Sagittarius Earth to Orion Earth, but I do not know exactly when it happened. In regard to the previous and current locations of my heart, [this illustration](https://i.imgur.com/l9DLnxZ.jpg) is quite accurate.
&gt; 
&gt; Sagittarius Earth:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. [The nasal bone does not exist; the nose is made entirely of cartilage](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cuyb5n/last_month_i_felt_my_heart_beating_at_the_center/ey209ui/?context=1)
&gt;     * When you look at a human skull, there is no indication that a nose protrudes from the middle of a living person's face.
&gt;  
&gt; 2. [Eisenhower is on the U.S. dime, not FDR](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/dh72v7/i_share_19_of_these_personally/f3jowhd/)
&gt;     * In the past, I would accumulate dozens and dozens of dimes at a time before taking them to a Coinstar machine, and I always counted them multiple times before making the trip. I can say with 100 percent certainty that FDR was not on any of those coins. Fast forward to September 2019—a month ago—and I see FDR on a dime for the first time in my life.
&gt;     * More info [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/dkqmxy/whose_head_is_on_the_us_dime/), [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/9x9zg0/let_me_show_you_the_reality_i_come_from_ive/e9sj7tv/?context=1), [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/e3ifxk/um_this_makes_absolutely_no_sense/f9kb7xv/), and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/e3ifxk/um_this_makes_absolutely_no_sense/).

&gt;     * Count to 10 by saying ""one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand ... ten one thousand,"" and bear in mind that completing it within the range of 10.10 to 13.85 seconds means that you counted at a normal speaking pace. So, how is it possible that just a few years ago, I, Dale DuFay, and others needed to use a slower-than-normal speaking pace in order to count to 10 in 10.00 seconds, but now a faster-than-normal speaking pace is required? Seriously think about that for a moment. Furthermore, when I count to 10 at the exact same pace as before, 15.00 seconds elapse instead of 10.00 seconds.

_____________________________

Please note the following:

* When responding to a list of 10 questions, Insider refused to respond to the question, ""On which planet do we live?"" It was entirely skipped over.

* Back in 2008, on Sagittarius Earth, none of us took Hidden Hand seriously. Concepts such as replica solar systems and the post-2008 harvesting of souls seemed like utter NONSENSE to me.  After all, I assumed that only one Earth existed, and I wasn't aware that one's consciousness could be [seamlessly transferred](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d7g6br/mandela_effect_some_christians_erroneously/f0zo8xe/) from one planet to another.

* If the above list looks strange to you, then you are probably not from Sagittarius Earth.

* In regard to #4 on the list, if you are a Mandela Effect skeptic, you will eventually come to this sobering conclusion: the two paces (i.e., the speaking pace that is used in order to count to 10 in 15.00 seconds, which is ""pace A"" below, and the speaking pace that is used in order to count to 10 in 10.00 seconds, which is ""pace B"" below) are too dissimilar to be confused with one another. And thus, the following scenario is NOT reasonably possible: Person X is absolutely certain that he has used pace A dozens, if not hundreds, of times in his life for the purpose of counting to 10 in 10.00 seconds; he then discovers, in astonishment, that he was actually using pace B all those times he counted to 10. In other words, all other things being equal, such a discrepancy between perception and reality is impossible.

* On Orion Earth, when the Mandela Effect is talked about in the mainstream media, the information that you see on this page is not presented. Rather, a lighthearted, sanitized version of the Mandela Effect is presented, and that is because the beings who control this planet need the truth about the Mandela Effect to be suppressed. Otherwise, without such suppression—that is, if we lived in a world where you could turn on the *CBS Evening News* and see someone talking about Hidden Hand—I suspect that their higher-ups would relieve them of their planetary duties.

* It is an undeniable fact that multiple Earths exist. Sadly, though, the masses are unaware of the information on this page, and that is because **the number-one priority of the mainstream media is to conceal the truth about the Mandela Effect**. What's more, you yourself will be complicit in the cover-up if you unwisely decide to hold on to your existing worldview (as opposed to modifying it and embracing the fact that multiple Earths exist). I know that may sound disrespectful or condescending, but I am just being brutally honest.

* Unlike the mainstream media, I am not involved in a Mandela Effect cover-up. Here, the truth about the Mandela Effect is plainly laid out for all to see. Apparently, though, the information on this page is so radioactive that none of the major news outlets are even willing to present it to the public for the purpose of subsequently debunking it. Instead, they simply pretend it does not exist, and they fully expect you and everyone you know to stay silent on the matter. And by the way, if you are a skeptic who wants to confront this phenomenon head on, I recommend starting a peaceful protest that is focused not on me but on the mainstream media's cover-up.

* I strongly suggest that you contact your local elected officials and direct them to this page.

Helena Blavatsky is one of the most convincing mystics in history, although most people have forgotten her. Perhaps the strongest evidence supporting her claims are the large number of witnesses in her time, and the Mahatma Letters which have been preserved for future review.

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2018/07/helena-blavatsky-ancient-aliens.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2018/07/helena-blavatsky-ancient-aliens.html?fbclid=IwAR1tP-Y7kAA8hZlaVzp2Z1Nwdj8VJdpoSWREFL70E9q8iunF91hY8HMcISU)

Other compelling mystics include Edgar Cayce, Padre Pio, Uri Geller, Andrew Jackson Davis and Incident at Fatima, which may provide the strongest evidence to connect UFOs with religion.

A close look at many of these mystics, prophets, spiritualists, or any other name they might go by indicates they may have some common characteristics, although there are variations in each.

Could they all be influenced by the same unknown advanced intelligence, possibly aliens, of some sort? If it's another unknown intelligence besides aliens what could it be?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0q18lnxczx751.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a24e74f7c569a8f909c288f70c427acd26bfbfdd

Religious people, of course often think it's God and that he's looking out for our best interest and will eventually pass judgement over us. However, this can't be the case, since if he was as benevolent as religious people choose to believe, he wouldn't have withheld advise that could have avoided many atrocities, including ones done for religious reasons, like the Crusades or inquisitions. 

The Ancient Aliens theory needs work, like any other; however, it's far more viable than the ""Good God"" theory, since it allows for an undisclosed agenda, which might explain why they don't communicate openly and honestly with all.

If this is the case could these mystics be part of a control process teaching us to do what they want, when they want implementing solutions only when it suits their purposes?

Could they be using us for research?

Many of these mystics, including Helena Blavatsky and Andrew Jackson Davis, do provide a lot of good advise, which we should follow when it can be confirmed; however, they often mix it up with bad advise, including efforts to reinforce the belief that God or ""the Masters"" or spirits are looking out for our best interests. This may be true some of the time, when their best interests and ours are compatible, but not all the time.

\---------------------------------

This happened in Goiânia, Brazil when I was about 10 or 11 (around 2004 maybe). I remember it was exactly 9:00pm and I was playing The Sims on the family computer with my cousin. I went go the kitchen to grab a drink. I got to the cabinet, got a glass cup and went for the water filter. The filter was right next to a big window with ondulated glass panels - common in brazil, something for privacy i think. (The ondulated glass made everything that was far look fractured, and the closer an object was, the less distorted it got).

I wasnt paying much attention to my surroundings but I was always a little scared of going to the kitchen at night because every time I turned the lights on, pigeons that were just chillin outside (there was a narrow-ish corridor to the backyard outside the kitchen window with a high wall separating the houses) started flapping their wings frantically making a lot of noise and scaring the shit out of me.

Anyway, this time I didn't really check if there were pigeons because I didnt hear any noise, the window was closed and there was only one light source lighting the outside. I finally fill my cup and start drinking. As soon as I'm finished and start putting the glass down, I look up and there's a dark shape outside. And because I was holding a glass cup I was carefully putting it down before considering running away. But I took that time to take a very good look at it.

It was so close to the window that there wasn't much distortion at all - The shape of a dark brown (not brown like human skin) head and a neck, with huge, pitch black, almost perfect circles as eyes. There was no indication of a nose or ears, but there was a small shadow where the mouth should be, as if it was a very small mouth with no lips.

The strange thing is that it didn't move the slightest the whole time I was there. The black eyes felt like they were staring right at me. I was so petrified. After I absolutely BOLTED out of that kitchen screaming and telling my cousin to go check on that window she obviously didn't want to so I myself, after about 2 minutes, went back to check. There was nothing there. There was no sound, nothing. Me and grandad went to check the backyard the next day and there was nothing out of the ordinary.

I was never a kid that really believed in anything paranormal but it was so strange I still don't know what to make of it.

Sorry for the super long post, I wanted to make this as clear an image as possible. If any of you had any experiences like this please let me know.",I had a very freighting encounter when I was a kid that I can't explain

aliens,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post this because it also could have to do with aliens. Anyways, I have always thought Earth had some missing element to it that we haven't discovered in modern days yet. I feel like people of the past had some access to knowledge we could only dream off. Maybe even some ancient power source or something. Maybe magic existed and something wiped it out? I just feel like there is something huge and super important we are supposed to be aware of as humans but, it's hidden from us. Either because it's been lost or it was destroyed? Has anyone else ever felt like this? Look at the world around you. Is this what we are meant to be doing? Like, if you sit your car in a parking lot waiting for your friend, who's in the store, and you just watch all the people pushing their shopping carts and going to their cars and buying things they work for. Is that how humans are meant to be living? Maybe aliens were here long ago and they gave us the tools we needed and over time with all the ancient wars, it was lost. Maybe Atlantis really was real and they used some crazy power source. Maybe they had discovered nuclear fusion? There is a big mystery to this planet and I am just aching to know. We probably won't find out until we die though. I have done mushrooms twice and have definitely accessed some higher dimension or plane, but I didn't connect with any other beings either alien or multidimensional. I wanted to also add this on too (spoiler alert), if you have watched the film called ""Aniara"", it's on Hulu I believe, but everyone is migrating to Mars because we messed up Earth so bad. The ship gets hit by space debris and pushes the ship off course. They have to eject all their fuel so it doesn't blow. They drift aimlessly through space. They are headed for some star system. Well, everything goes to shit and people start dying or killing themselves once they realize they will forever be drifting lost in space. At the very end of the film, it shows the ship finally arriving in a star system and coming into orbit of a beautiful Earth like planet, 6 MILLION YEARS LATER. No kidding, they actually jump that far ahead and show the ship finally arriving. Of course, there is nothing left but the ship but everything else is gone and decayed away and floating around. That's the end of the movie. It made me wish they took it further. The ship could have been pulled in too much by the planet's gravity and feel into the atmosphere and crash land on the surface or maybe into the ocean. In the movie, there didn't look to be any sign of modern day civilization as there were no city lights on the dark side of the planet. Maybe it was just starting to develop life. So say the ship crashes in some ocean. Millions of years later, modern people of that planet will start exploring their oceans and dive down and, lets say they discovered that ship. The ship would be millions of years old but it would be a sign there was some ancient civilization that traveled through space and came to their planet. It would probably remain undiscovered though if it crashed into the ocean. Maybe a desert that turned to ice over time like our Antarctica.

Somewhere in the mountain valleys of Southern Oregon, I am playing with my new star finder app when I see a comet appear on my screen. Excited, I run outside of my lodge &amp; point my phone up towards the sky. Quickly I see a large blue comet sailing by! Right behind this comet I immediately see another blue light.. kind of pingponging back &amp; forth in a diamond pattern..I hold my phone up to this light and it registers in the app but it doesn't have a label. All of the sudden this light soars down past me and into the field ahead of me! I yell for my friend (let's call her nat) to come out quickly &amp; see whatever this is with me! It's getting pretty dark outside so I flip on my camera flashlight &amp; book it across the field to see what it is. I get about 10 feet away when I see a small dark leathery brown ship..it couldn't be more than 3 feet in diameter.. &amp; had a strip of blue lights across one side( I assume the engine/energy source?) Just as my brain is registering what I am seeing it zooms up and zips back towards my home. My heart is pounding &amp; I quickly realize my friend isn't with me! I run as fast as I can back inside and shut the door behind me. I find Nat &amp; ask If she saw anything &amp; why hadnt she come out?! At this point I'm standing in front of our large living room window..its about 8ft up from the ground..when Nat is unresponsive to my questions &amp; is just deadpan staring over my shoulder out of the window behind me. All of the hair on my body rose. Slowly.. I turned to look behind me. Just outside my window stood a tall pale pearl/grey white ET. Immediately I got what seemed like a download of information about this being..how they see..travel..where it is from..etc. as well as the feeling that it now also knew every last bit of information about me. I was captivated by its large inky black almond shaped eyes when it raised its hand with three long fingers ending in bulbous fingertips &amp; gave three light taps on the window . Which shook our entire home. *BOOM.BOOM.BOOM* Now, I'm blinking my eyes rapidly trying to shake myself out of my fear struck stupor..as I blink this being begins to dissipate &amp; my eyes readjust to be looking out of my bedroom window.. Suddenly I wake up from apparently this most intense and vivid dream of my life. The next day my neighbors came over to ask me what kind of drone I had with a blue light..they saw it darting back &amp; forth over my lodge last night..I have no drone &amp; never did.",Pacific Northwest Alien Encounter

My friend was walking her dog over Epsom Downs in the UK in the evening, it was in the woods behind the race track and it was winter so was pitch black up there, I was on the phone to her when it happened. 

She was walking down a wooded trail using only her phone light which she was pointing at the floor to see the path, when right in front of her in the middle of the path maybe 7-8ft or so away there was a very bright set of eyes staring at her, she said they were probably about 7ft head height (said they were quite a bit taller than a average human) they were bright yellow and very large and perfectly round, and kept blinking every second or so. She didn't shine the light on it unfortunately, she just saw it, froze for 5 seconds or so and then turned around and walked in the opposite direction, I could hear the fear in her voice. 

It was strange and the eyes seemed to glow, bearing in mind there was no natural light to reflect the light off the eyes as brightly as she described, it was a rainy cloudy night and there are no roads with car headlights penetrating where she was. It was so dark she couldn't even see their figure. Her dog ran back to her it seemed to run straight through as if it ran under its legs (dog weighs 60KG) and didn't react to its presence 

The bushes surrounding the path were bare of leaves and very stick thin/weak branches, and the eyes where in the middle so couldn't have been an owl, far to tall to have been a fox or badger, there aren't deer up there and she said the eyes were forward facing - as in same distance apart and position as human eyes. She said they were very bright and very large, she definitely wasn't seeing things, she has never made up stories or witnesses anything like this before, and the fear in her voice was real, I've never heard her like that

aliens,"So this happened in November 2017.
I worked as a math tutor for a family in a different part of my city.
To get there I had to commute for about 45 minutes to their house, with a train.
This one night the family had rescheduled my lesson to 18:00 o'clock.
So after university I took a nap, went to the train station around 17:00.
The whole time I was on my phone, it was dark outside and up to about 2 or 3 stations away there were also a lot of commuters before it emptied out to only me and 2 or 3 other people.
Then I existed the train, I was the only one in sight, it was really dark outside.
I had to do a 10 minute walk to their home.
I do not know what happened, I just know I suddenly got a phone call from the mom if I would even show up today.
I said yeah ofc I'm on my way.
She said it's getting late and they want to sleep so I looked at the time and somehow it was 21:00, so I missed around 3 hours.
I DO NOT KNOW what happened in this time period.
Sometimes I try to comprehend, thinking that maybe I slept through my nap alarm and then just went out the door when I woke up whenever.
Sometimes I think that maybe the train just stood somewhere for an absurd amount of time and I just didn't notice because I was on the phone.
I ended up going all the way back home and then quit my job btw., I didn't want to take this route ever again somehow.

aliens,"First things first, I have an unshakable belief, beyond wishful or religious in the existence of Alien life in the form of intelligent beings. This belief was refined over the years with the study of the phenomenon, the books, my inclination to ancient history that brought me to the not so refined works of Von Daniken but which in turn led me to Zacharia Sitchin and many others. This is not a recent phenomenon, my phobia, nightmare fuel and simultaneous fascination with Aliens/UFO has been there since my very first memories. 
I have a constant feeling that I do not remember something, and if I do recall it I am not completely certain that these are fabricated memories, from dreams or my young imagination, following are some of the earliest memories I have, between ages 6 and 12-13. 

- My very first recurring nightmare was of having a picnic with my parents in a green grass park, next to trees when suddenly 4 to 5 tall men in grey suits (at the time I associated them to the enemies of the Power Rangers ""Putty Patrollers"" please check for images on google) would grab me and take me away.
- Another recurring dream, especially when I had a fever, was of running/driving/flying uncontrollably fast. In specific one of being on someones shoulders while he ran reaching absurd speeds.
- I can not be one 100% sure but I have crosschecked this next point with my mother who seems to remember something of the sort. I remember waking up with 9 round brownish burned looking marks on the stomach. This memory came flooding back after watching a documentary on the Falcon Lake incident and seeing similar marks on one of the abductees. 
- In my childhood I have been sick on a regular basis, almost monthly with very high and sudden fevers. 
- Lastly in this age range I have vague memories of symbols scratched onto my window, but I still dismiss them today as just dirt, an obsession with spotting satellites and a lasting fear of the dark. To this day I find it difficult to fall asleep unless some movie, or show is playing on my laptop. 

The following is from ages 13-14 to 19-20. (I am 30 years old)

- In France, where I have lived for about 10 years we have a large enough property with a modern Chalet style house in the middle of a large garden surrounded by trees. At night from the very beginning I could hear heavy steps running around the house from my ground floor bedroom. The steps would get fainter as they went around and louder as they approached closer to my room. The time the steps took to run around the house in circles was too fast, weirdly fast. Something worth mentioning is the stomping was clearly of two distinct footsteps and not of an animal running on all fours. This happened throughout the 8-10 years I have lived there with my mom. 
- During this time, I can not recall if it was while the running sound was happening, our garden developed a ""Fairy Ring"" quite large in diameter between 3-4m. I have read about them and even if the name implies something Fairy Related, the explanation is of a fungus colony that takes the ring like shape. Nonetheless given all of the above, I thought it worth of mention.
- During one of the summers spent in Italy (Sardinia Island to be precise) I have witnessed something I still can not explain, and I was not alone. While with a friend, at his grandparent's house playing in the back yard, we could see the lit lights of the 3 stories house in front of his. In particular one window was lit in yellow light with  the horizontal shades open and the outline of a man with both his hands up on the glass and his fingers moving as if playing with the shades. I turned to look at my friend who in turn looked at me freaked out, we both turned our heads towards the window and the same shadowy outline with its hands up on the window and its fingers playing with the shades no longer had its head. It was headless and still moving. We ran away immediately terrified. I have spoken to him about it not 2 ,months ago.
- In the same bedroom mentioned earlier one night while fully awake and conscious something quite silly but terrifying took place. I was trying my best to fall asleep as I had school the next morning and one voice as loud as hear my fingers typing now, said in my ear ""YOU'RE A PENGUIN"". I do not claim a connection with anything and I do not know if the voice in my head or rather in my ear said something that sounded like that or if in fact perhaps, I am a penguin. I did not sleep that night and I now wonder what my brain interpreted that voice to be saying. Something worth mentioning is after telling the story to my father he said that shortly before he woke up from a voice shouting in his year ""67"". Again, do not know that it means, if it means anything or if you heard of similar accounts. 
- I have what I believe to be a small cyst in my arm, I can feel it and hold it between my fingers, it feels mobile. I do not doubt that it is exactly that, a cyst that I should probably get it removed, but in the spirit of full disclosure I have thought, on multiple occasions, what if it isn't. 

Today.

- Today I am 30, I have an incredible girlfriend who believes me and a family who doesn't disbelieve me, I am passionate and studious in the phenomenon, I have the books, and they taught me about history, the manuscripts of Jung who in its part taught me about philosophy and psychoanalysis, I have the military documents from more trustworthy sources (Greer and others) and less so (Tom Delonge....).  In any case, the strangeness quieted down since I moved to the Middle East in 2015 but it hasn't stopped and my interest is boiling inside me more than ever. Just writing all of it down for the first time clarifies and sharpens memories, and I am sure I missed a few. I am studying the region for historical features which could be connected to the phenomenon, and I have found rock carvings in Oman clearly depicting greys within humans. 
- Just recently my mother found a very strange foot of what we guess could be an animal in the same garden in the house in France. The skin is white and bloodless, the texture is chicken like but the size is too big and wide to be an avian. 
- Last week the light in my apartment in Dubai turned on in the middle of the night, while with my girlfriend.
- While driving on the highway I spotted a light above me, it was still until it was not. It shot straight ahead and then disappeared.
- My move to Dubai has brought a lot of positive energy, as if lifted from something I have started to go to the Gym very regularly, my mind feels sharp, I am eating well and am driven on my career. I have a fantastic relationship with my girlfriend and I feel good enough to share the above weirdness.

Also from a lot of abducted stories people mentioned that they believed the aliens tried to make it look like they never was abducted..

They really can’t abducting people and return them back to the same place?

They can erase our memories from the experience but can’t make us believe it was never happened?

How we know that aliens in outer space created weapons?what if they don’t even need weapons?

aliens,"So this shit is gonna sound absolutely bizarre and out of this world (no pun intended) but here goes.
So I basically grew up all over California in what's called group homes. I was an angry kid most of my life and didn't have family so low and behold I was a little asshole who needed to be put away til I could learn to deal with shit. So anyways 18 group homes, 3 foster homes and a lockdown later, I turned 18 and finally aged out. Well shit was hard, and I mean really hard. Institutionalized to the fullest. I was so far away from society that when I turned 18 I learned what a fuckin flat screen tv was at 18. So in short, i was substantially fucked up mentally, had no idea how to adult and sunk into some gnarly depression. Well I said fuck it one night and swallowed some pills. And by ""some"" I mean 5 full bottles of ambian. For those of you who don't know, ambian is a sleeping medicine that is no joke strong as shit. So I tried to commit suicide. And it worked. Except I was brought back 5 times and was in a coma for a month and a half and had to relearn how to walk and had to do speech therapy for months. I remember taking the pills on the beach and looking and smiling. Now I'm 25 and have two kids and have basically made a full recovery to the point to where my doctors and specialists are shocked. 

So this is where shit gets weird....

About 4 years ago I made the choice to recontact the person I was with the night I said fuck it. Their story/version is what scares me the most. I was in Ventura California, (close to LA) even have a video of me surfing with them the day before. I remember vividly walking out to the beach and sitting there and smiling. They said they went to bed and I was on the beach (we were at my buddies beach house, He's got his own beach essentially) the next morning I was gone.... All my shit was there still, and I was fuckin gone. Poof. They called and called, no answer then made a missing persons report two days later after contacting my foster family and learned they had no response from me either.
I was found in Redding California 3 months later. (750 miles away, how the fuck I got there, I have no idea) The doctors said I had been pronounced dead on the scene then was resuscitated and brought back numerous times before being placed on life support for several weeks. I had a 3% brain activity. I woke up and they asked the basic shit, what's your name where you from what year is it ect ect, and I tell them I'm in Ventura California. Now you hallucinate alot after a coma, it just happens. So they thought it was part of the coma recovery. Nope, its true. I had been missing for 3 months before i was ""found in redding"".

Ever since the ""fuck it"" moment happened, I've had dreams, vivid dreams. Not every night but every other night or so and their just weird. And they are so real.... Its military shit and sometimes I'm being water boarded in them and sometimes I'm watching people be water boarded, I'm also killing people in these dreams but its so real from the ring in my ear after the gun goes off or the feeling of pure numb. Its too surreal. I had a hypnosis done and the lady was shocked when I woke up and told me that I needed to leave.... Idk what's going on but I need help. I have shit that is happening that I can't explain either. I know when someone's gonna say something and sometimes I can feel others emotions. I knew when my mom was sick and called an ambulance when i was 5 states away from her and hadn't talked to her in weeks. Idk... Idk if this will even be seen but I just hope someone is gonna see this and know what I'm experiencing isn't false and I'm not crazy. Believe me, I've been down that path, several psychologists and doctors later, no I'm not skitzo or anything even remotely close. I committed suicide in one place and woke up almost 1000 miles away with absolutely no idea how the fuck I got there.  So while you try to figure it out here's a list of shit that I know it can't be.
Not mentally fucked up
Never did drugs (I smoke weed but let's be real here fellas)
No I wasn't on any medicine prior to the incident
Yes all the medical records are fuckin gone minus the fact that I have discharge paperwork they says doesn't exist, I've got $150,000 in medical bills as proof yet when I asked billing dept they said I don't have any information just a debt. Which worked in my favor because I no longer have those bills anymore they took them off due to no proof I was even a resident at the ICU for 47 days. 
Shit is not adding up and I can't remember half my childhood which is good now I guess but it makes me fuckin wonder what the fuck really happened... I guess thanks for reading, plz don't make fun of me or call me crazy, I already have a hard enough time even telling a therapist I have these fucked up dreams let alone a conspiracy I was possibly picked up by aliens or something. I've been huge into Mk ultra and something is telling me to strive more towards that direction but lots of abduction stories are similar to mine in the events that happened.",I think something happened to me (Please dont think im crazy)

Gotta  admit I liked it very much surprisingly, reminds me of my favorite ufo  short series - Close encounters single fascinating case with good solid  witnesses and summary. I haven't about this case before yet it seems so  familiar, almost like copy and paste from many others. So we got couple  of 'experiencers' or rather victims who had quite aggressive ufo  encounters. Its quite original actually cause 1 witness claims he was  frozen in a timespace trap while other saw that amazing event also its  clearly being said how the 'live abduction' looks like - they shot some  sort of beam manipulating time and space continuum around you to numb  you and from what it can be understood scientifically - they teleport  you over to the ship!!(or they just transfer you via the beam which I  hope is the latter). Wow right? This is just as fucking amazing as it  can be. But there is more - 2 witnesses kind of meet each other during  abduction on the ship! Ufo roams the small town like its flying  christmass tree causing other people to see it and they experience very  weird time space anomalies as well.

We  sure have heard that before by many all over the world through last 60  to 70 years. I would like to speculate science of this. Ufo itself is  big shining ball of light, maybe its just big saucer emitting very large  amout of electromagnetic radiation, maybe its just air molecules  withstanding crazy amount of ionization or maybe the ufo, going little  dr Greerish here, is kind of in between dimensions, teleporting but yet  maintaining in the place of origin, sort of like looking through a  window and reaching out - and the images they see is what our mind is  capable of 'decoding'. What kind of futuristic technology it would take  to perform such a phenomenal activities, to catch a guy in a light beam  net stop or slow time around him so he wouldnt run or hurt himself, but  we need him on the ship now for what? This is so mindboggling the  purpose of all this, is it what dna material they need from him, what  possibly these guys controlling surrounding timespace would want? They  could basically steal him at any point during his sleep without being  noticed at all! Now here is the thing - they do not want to get noticed.  Although often they fail their stealth missions miserably, yet they  never land in city center and do the ufo beam me up scotty thing do  they? So whats up with that? Is it some hidden evil intentions is that  some bad news? Sure they care about not hurting them not even leaving a  scratch on them which is good news BUT attorney at law would find  paragraphs for them aliens they are committing blatant felonies -  kidnapping, causing stress and trauma, also condemning that person for  all the 'experiencers repercussuions' - who on earth will believe it if  they themself cant?

I believe, that there are many other planets like EARTH that have intelligent life on it with the capability of TRUE EVOLUTION. You have to understand me and my kind are time travelers and we have been stopping by and aiding other species to attain TRUE EVOLUTION. This is why the evil inside the black hole wants to consume and destroy these planets because planet EARTH was created inside the black hole and planets like these possess the capability to destroy or undo the black hole, or the abyss, and be the only way to truly escape and break free from it. Perhaps I was wrong about my race destroying the other evil alien races, maybe they are out there who knows. I am pretty sure they are not around Earth. The rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper. I believe on March 19th, 2020 two terrible and terrifying monsters, Cthululululu and Leviathan will be the first to slip through the great portal inside the Bermuda Triangle. There is something about our third dimension that makes it hard for these monsters and demons to slip through. I have a theory that my race has been a protective barrier or something like this to protect the planet so that it can survive long enough to reach their own TRUE EVOLUTION which would destroy the Abyss, or black hole we live in or whatever.
CTHULULULUU and LEVIATHAN are the first to enter our world on March 19th, 2020 through the Bermuda Triangle facing the direction of Miami, Florida. For those of you who have already lost interest, that’s all you really need to know to be a sleeper cell of a thought and idea that exists in the back of your mind waiting to be unlocked by whatever series of signs that will be presented to you, if you are open to receive them of course as every individual can either accept or deny their own destinies. As for you Cthululululu cultists out there, Cthululu doesn't give a shit about you and he will eat you up just like any other human. You are only meat puppets that are making him 0.00001% stronger when you worship and pray to him, so please, don't talk about love and world peace.
notice i talk about cthulu eating an dbcoming .000001 stronger explained everytime it spreads it has that much more change to mutate and become stronger which covid has alreayd mutated
There was a message after a great astral situation that I just experienced. Where the many red eyes I called out to be blue or they would perish, and the one who challenged me gone. The message was, that there is no time. March 19th, 2020, the great portal of the Bermuda Triangle opens. I will be 33 years old and I will be there, not within the portal itself, as I do not do this until much later in my life. I will be where I was when I first felt its raw power and beauty in the darkness, the wonder and terribleness of it all. I was there, back in 2010 I believe it was. Yes, just like when I wrote in 10 years when you are not the same, for I will truly not be the same in 2020. Homeless on the beach of Miami. Where I awoke in the night to the great 11:11 above the hotel. Where I stumbled to the edge of the water, my hand stretched outwards towards the great wind that was against me from the great dark ocean. It was there, although I did not know it at the time, that I felt the power of the greatest portal of the seven. And I know that it is there, in that portal, that I will fulfill my destiny one day. I am the Phoenix of the Dark Oceans.
Now on to the whole prediction chapter of my life, which I have no idea how it all got started. I had a small following on my Myspace page which if I remember right the address of it was like myspace.com/paranormal06 and I put my name as Joshua 11:11 on it I think. I was going on a manic spree of writings and poems and I was talking as if I was a prophet, no doubt from all the things I experienced I felt like I had some say in life and destiny or whatever else so I was full on prophet mode. Somehow through a deep web of signs and destiny and synchronizations together and also believing I had contact with the Mothman, much like how I came up with the Bermuda Triangle March 19th, 2020 prediction where Cthulu and Leviathan enter our planet's astral realm.
The following message is for all the Grey Alien spaceships up above pretending to be stars so that all the humans don't freak out and destroy each other once they see there are no stars and the moon is just one of the many home bases of the Greys and that we were all born inside of and exist within a black hole that is filled with monsters more terrible than even H.P. Lovecraft's wildest imaginations or are exactly of his imagination which is why he was receiving images and information about them through dreams and all these terrible monsters are prepearing to swarm in on planet EARTH through one of the seven great portals the one named Bermuda Triangle on March 19th, 2020 and thus consuming EARTH or we just at one point self destruct our own planet.
Do what you like, but I use blue lighters now to smoke my ultra light cigarettes. Just like the four demons I believed I have converted to the light and turned their eyes blue instead of destroying them and stand as watchmen at the third corners of the Bermuda Triangle, which I believe is the greatest portal to the monsters of the Abyss that I feel are planning to enter our world on March 19th, 2020. Just like in a saga of Dragonball Z, they are coming and they are on their way and we need to prepare for the great spiritual war that is about to begin much sooner than we anticipated. Cthulululu and Leviathan are the first to enter.

However I am looking to get more information, a friend of mine has one on their back and I asked about if they ever had a biopsy done or anything like that; they told me no.

I wanted to know do these marks ever come from medical procedures? It is in a peculiar spot and I don't imagine a doctor would choose there for any particular purpose.

Wondering the black knight is a monitoring station and they abduct certain people and put them back to help boost humanity’s immunity or evolution naturally like if you bred animals. Plagues seem to happen every 100,000 years maybe they try to bred out our genetic problems over time.

aliens,"For me as a skeptic, the most interesting and convincing testimonies are those from individuals with respectable, mainstream credentials. People who know what they're talking about and who have the most to lose by associating themselves with the topic of aliens and UFOs. 

It's a bit hard to write these people off as simply ""kooks"". So what I've done is assembled a list well-known people with these credentials, mostly scientists and military officers, along with links to their Wikipedia pages. It did not take me long, and I'm sure there are many more of these people out there.

I also urge those who are new to this topic to check out the articles on the [Manises Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manises_UFO_incident), [the 1952 Washington, DC Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident), and the [Japan Airlines Flight 1628 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_1628_incident#Observation) if they are interested in hearing about qualified people who saw things they couldn't explain.

Working with people with down syndrome and autism I have realized they share many similarities with these space men in their talents. That would explain their advancements with ships the everyday people have no idea how to work with.

aliens,"I am a man in my late 30s. I grew up in middle class, went to high school and college, then went to work. Lived life. Broke hearts, got heart broken, partied, lost loved ones and played video games. Aka, your standard normal life. 

I was ""open"" to the possibility of ""more"". Being alone in the universe as the sole existence of life seemed highly unlikely to me. 

For the last 4 months, I have had ""contact"" with something that is the definition of ""alien"" in that they are not from here, and in no way are what we've ever thought them to be. 

I'm going to be honest and say I was celebrating at the end of the year and was ""partying"" with a few friends, which is when it ""started"". For the first few weeks, it was just really amazing, but I was also high a lot of the time. 

Since CV started, I haven't done anything recreational in almost 2 months, and ended up having to leave my city and take care of my brother in a neighboring state. 

I realize I sound like a maniac, or a troll, but after 4 months of this, after confiding to two friends and  explaining to them that for a while I thought this was just a strange psychological experience as a result of some recreational substances, but it's gone on for far too long- and then having them give me strange looks and obviously just concluding that I was on drugs or something. Makes me feel really fucking lonely and amazed, and definitely scared. 

If anyone else experiences (with your eyes closed): One of two tunnels, with one going upwards at a sharp angle, or another  tunnel that it completely straight and symmetrical with very sharp 90 degree angles, with the tunnels flickering between red, blue and green. You aren't imagining it. 

If you look into a mirror or dark screen (like a monitor or television) in darkness (not total darkness as you need to be able to see, but like with the lights off in the room, but a hallway light on, and see the shadows moving around your eyes. You aren't imagining it. 

If you feel a strange pressure around the tips of your fingers and head, as though they are being lightly vaccummed. You aren't imagining it. 

There are parts of me that can't believe this is actually happening, yet it's so real and it's daily and I've seen far too many things for far too long for me to think it's just me. I'm also quite terrified as to what the implications of this could be. 

For people who are die-hard believers, I have good news for you. We aren't alone. 

Feel free to ask other stuff, I don't know, I just wanted to share it. I am half-way through writing an honest account, in case something happens to me. 

The other part was just in case anyone else has been experieincing these things too.",Welp. They are real.

There are remote villages in the world that couldn’t imagine the technology that exists outside of their island. The Sentineli live on the Sentinel islands in the Indian Ocean and are believed to have been in the same isolated living conditions for thousands of years. The Indian Government has vowed to leave them be, as they have no desire for contact with the outside world. The couple of times contact was made, the Sentinels quickly killed the outsiders  on the beach as they docked.

If you were to take one, and put him in the middle of Bill Gates living room, his mind would be blown. It would be otherworldly. Television. Surrounded by clean crisp architectural lines. Color palettes he’s never seen. If he was transported there, it wouldn’t be far fetched to seem like another world.

As it stands, “Aliens” exist without us needing to know about them.  They want to remain secret. They have their territory and we have ours. 

The Sentineli do have a few flight paths over them by military of defense, which probably seem like UFO sightings to them when they do see a plane in the sky. Indian Government wants to reroute them in the event that one were to crash. Their government proposed, “what would happen to the people that may survive? What would happen to the Sentineli? It would be easier to just leave them alone, as long as they just do their thing...they don’t even know how to make fire, so they aren’t causing a stir. However if they DID, I’m sure we would monitor them a bit more closely and intervene if it ever needed to be done. It would be nothing to overtake them, but we choose to live at a distance...so long they aren’t threatening. 


  I could see humans in the future....like 2080 (if they still have indigenous tribes) going to pick one of these guys up just to “blow his mind”. Some real Hunger Games elite type reality show type of thing. 


  There’s always been conspiracy about what happens in Antarctica. There is super limited people allowed on Antarctica. But there’s been a question since Admiral Byrd , a naval officer and explorer set out to explore Antarctica in 1928. He said he went through a hole in the ice and was in a city. It’s referred to as Agartha. (Hollow earth)

  Could be it’s understood, “we leave them alone, they leave us alone” type of thing. Certain government knows about them and has limited contact. But every once in awhile....they get seen “checking up on us”. Flying our skies. They are often seen at military sites. It’s been said they’ve intercepted missiles. What if they are making sure we’re not messing up to bad, or they will intervene? 

   They aren’t like us though. They wouldn’t abduct us for Hunger Games fun like the human race would in 2080. They would pick us up for science purposes. Which all abduction cases sound like you’re put in the middle of a high tech lab, around things you can’t comprehend. Architecture you don’t understand. Technology you’ve never seen. Otherworldly....

Is the human race really an indigenous race, kept at arm length to what really exists outside our basic knowledge?

I checked my Flightradar24 app and there is only one flight flying over and it was clearly visible as a plane, blinking lights and all. These things were flying waaaay above 30,000 feet and moving much faster than a commercial flight. I even stopped another guy on the beach because it was fucking weird. I was tracking them and tried to get a recording but it’s dark as fuck out right now. In the video you can only see one and it’s barely visible, like baaaarely visible, iPhones suck in low light but I’d be happy to share it if anyone’s interested. Right after I finished my video they just blinked away. Like literally one second my eye was trained on them and then they just vanished. I’ve become a pretty skeptical person recently so I’m not going to definitively say it was a UFO fleet (I mean it could have just been high flying military planes or something) but this is the first time I’ve actually seen something that made me stop and audibly say WTF. They weren’t moving like planes and they were going twice to three times the speed of a lower flying commercial plane and at higher altitude so they must have been fucking booking it through the stratosphere or some shit.

aliens,"I had an experience that I have been pondering on for a few years now and I don't know if it because the things I have been learning about lately and it helped me create this dream or if it's that I have really opened myself up to other entities that are now interacting with me.

I don't know if this pertains to everyone but I know I'm not the only one. But I can tell when I am dreaming while I'm in a dream and I can control it at times like if im on a clif and I'm scared I'm gonna fall i think to myself and say I yeah I'm in a dream so I can just fly and I start flying. But what I'm saying is I know when I am dreaming and I be having some all over the place dreams. But I had one that baffles me its hard to explain to myself.

Ok so it was like a normal dream but then all of a sudden Im  looking at a black background and white dots going past me really fast like as if I was in a spaceship going at warp speed then I noticed I I was looking out of a window or something at least that's the impression I had but I didn't actually look like I was looking out a window but I knew I was looking out at something from the inside of somewhere and I was alone but I had a feeling I wasn't alone . Then all of a sudden I'm on the other side of what ever I was looking out of and so now it was like I was the best way I can describe it is like I was swimming in space with the stars and I say swimming because in my head I was sitting inside like a inner tube or something and I didn't see anyone else with me but I must have been having alot of fun with someone because I can remember I had a big cheesy ass smile on my face and even though I didn't see anyone but just like I said when I was looking out from a window I had a feeling like I wasn't alone.

But then all of a sudden I was at home walking up The stairs to my room and there was someone walking up following behind me and when I opened my bedroom door first thing hit me was how I felt the warn air go into my nose body a just like it would feel if you were to walk into a warm room and you can smell the heat and I remember thinking in my head damn that's crazy how did that feel so real it felt like I really felt that and I noticed it was day time I'm guessing around between 7-12 cause the sun was out and it was starting to warm the room up hence the  warmth I felt when I opened the door. 

Then I see myself sleeping in my bed and and now it got weirder because it was like I was looking at myself while I slept and I was thinking to myself this is a weird dream and I was like  I can wake up if I want to but I just don't want to.  Mind you whoever it was that was following behind me were still directly behind and as I finally turned around and and seen who was behind me I seen it was a regular looking  woman I wanna say brown skinned but as I looked at her her face started to change. It's weird and hard to explain exactly the way it had changed but it was kinda like how when ironman or the Black panther mask comes on but it started to change and she started looking more like I guess the closet thing I can compare it to would be the 90s ninja turtles movie and had those dots on kinda like they did in the 3rd one and her skin color is hard to explain but it was light greyish blue with a little bit of brown I guess. But it all happened quickly so I really only got a brief look at her as this happened and she was assisting me as I lay down but I'm laying back down on the bed  into by own body 

And as she dose this she gave me a kiss on the cheek and this is no lie  when she kissed me my whole body started tingling and it made me giggle and I even heard myself  giggle in my sleep to where I was like did you just giggle like that it sounded like how a little girl would giggle. Then when I woke up witch was rite after I did the little giggle and I woke up in the same position I was in when I looking down at me sleeping and everything else was just like I mentioned when I came into my room I seen the sun was out and it was just as warn as it felt when I opened the door 

And Yea I know it sounds like I just had a dream I would have summed it up to that too but I have learned there are different ways different species communicate and  abduct people and it depends on a few things. witch are the different levels  and abilities the higher density they are we are at the lowest witch is 3rd density but the 5 and up density beings communicate through a dream state and then what is commonly known to us is the physical abduction when they actually come and abduct you and those are the ones when alot of the bad stuff happens and horror story's come from 

I don't know what race of beings it was exactly but I do have  a couple I think it could have been is either the arcturians  one of the Syrian races",I think I was abducted
aliens,"Hi all,

A .org website was shared within the past couple months that theorized how UFOs traveled (basically by freefall).",Looking for the website...
aliens,"This year I have started to believe that there may be more than one explanation for UFOs. So I decided to make a speculative post about it.

Mistaken identity UFOs

Mick West's balloons as well as MKULTRA-style psyops, experimental planes like U-2 and SR-71, hoaxes, radar spoofing, madness, holograms and possibly even reverse engineered spaceships built by humans. I just put this here as a reminder that most sightings are not the legit item.

Extraterrestrial UFOs

A civilization just slightly more advanced than current humanity could fill all of the Milky Way galaxy with Von Neumann probes in the time span of a few million years. If there was even one such civilization the galaxy should be full of Von Neumann probes. The civilization could now be extinct or a machine civilization. I gather Von Neumann probes would be limited to exploration and research of the galaxy since an AI having its own ideas would be insanely dangerous to the species that created it. They might turn hostile upon receiving updated programming if the OG aliens are still alive, but I would think there is some kind of a prime directive enforced in the galaxy. I think these would most likely be unmanned, but if FTL travel is possible the original aliens might also visit us. Or maybe the probes can 3D print androids that look like real biological beings. In any case Von Neumann probes should be really common if any kind of an advanced civilization has ever existed in our galaxy.

Interdimensional UFOs

The Jacques Vallee/C.G.Jung UFO theory. Consciousness-related phenomenon from another dimension of reality or perhaps from the depths of collective unconsciousness. These beings would be just paranormal with our current science completely unable to deal with it. If simulation theory is correct they could also be the beings who programmed the simulation, or glitches in the simulation, or beings from inside the simulation who learned how to hack the simulation. In any case this would be the territory of consciousness, paranormal and myths. Apparently these beings are often tricksters and like to make jokes on humans. A catch-all ""others"" bin for simulation theory, consciousness-related phenomena, extra dimensions and generally things that don't make any sense in the current science. Although I think we would be able to understand other varieties of UFOs pretty well, interdimensionals might be really hard to understand at all for thousands  of years.

Cryptoterrestrial UFOs

Perhaps something evolved on Earth millions of years before humans and now hides in the oceans? There are too many stories about USOs to just ignore this theory. I think the stories about Gray ""aliens"" abducting humans and creating genetic hybrids seems more like cryptoterrestrials than extraterrestrials. Why would extraterrestrials be compatible enough with humans to create hybrids? Why would they need to come here personally to do it? Why would not a mere DNA sample be enough? Abduction tales also point to the ""aliens"" having surprisingly bad biotechnology. And why do they keep crashing if they come from another solar system? Why are they so worried about nukes and climate change if they come from another star system? All of this becomes understandable if you think Grays are cryptoterrestrial instead of extraterrestrial.


Extratemporal UFOs

Time travellers from the future. These could be humans from the future or our evolutionary descendants. We don't know if time travel is possible, but I would gather it would be a likely side-effect of FTL travel. Some UFO cases (like Rendlesham forest incident) seem to hint at this origin theory. I believe time travellers would create a grandfather paradox and split the timelines, which is why they would always come from a slightly different timeline to what our timeline becomes after they have visited us. ","Extraterrestrials, interdimensionals, cryptoterrestrials and extratemporals"
aliens,"**The last half is pretty good!**

First half is unfortunately a rehash of the nimitz incident and the american perspective, which has been covered to death.

What is interesting and new (to me, at least), however, is the *italian* perspective.

**For those that can't watch or are lazy, here are some takeaways from the interviews with italians.**

\-elizondo offhandedly states, ""hate to say it, but they \[italians\] may know more about this than we do""

\-italians openly study uap, unlike most other capable countries

\-weird to note that deitrich is censored here, when her involvement has been clear for a long time now

\-meeting with elizondo and delonge with italians:

\--sukhoi fighter jets successfully fire howitzer 64 rounds at strange weather-balloon-shaped uap; shots were ineffective, seemingly *absorbed* by the ship; this uap was intruding on military airspace

\--in a different disturbing case, a uap was *hostile*, used a ""pulse ray"" to obliterate the tail of a helicopter tasked with investigating uaps 

\--italians claim that they noted uaps must ""de-cloak"" to engage weapons; this is a claim either corroborated or relayed by levenda in sekret machines: chasing shadows

\--oddly, italians seemingly gave this info expecting to receive info of ""similar gravity"" from elizondo/delonge; the documentary cuts away as elizondo responds; i highly doubt that elizondo just rehashed to the italians what is publicly available, cause that would've been somewhat insulting their intelligence",Unidentified: UFOs in the Headlines --- New Documentary --- Interesting Italian Perspective

aliens,"Children’s reports of past life memories have been well documented in the scientific literature, with several cases even including identification of the deceased persons. This phenomena also surprisingly exists in cultures where reincarnation is NOT the predominant belief.  Anyways, with close to 50 years of research and data spanning different cultures, time periods, and even genders, not one case has had a child recalling an alien past life. I’m not talking about a crackhead who believes he is or was an alien, but rather, children who’ve displayed consistent behavioral patterns associated with past life memories have not revealed any alien memories.

Hello. It all began in March of 2009. One night I felt that something was irritating my ear. I remember touching it and it became worse, now both of my ears were irritated (squished against my head by something) so I moved irritating objects out of my ears and when I let go of it, it snapped back at both sides of my head. I opened my eyes and for a second, I thought that I was still asleep because I wasn’t in my bed in the matter of fact I wasn’t laying down. I was sitting in front of the big moving window. I took irritating object of my head. It was a headphones. I remember looking in front of myself and feeling such a terror. I don’t know how to describe it. I was seating on the front seat of helicopter and I was holding a metal steak in my hand. I guess I was a pilot. I had a panic attack. I was turning my head around like crazy. A man appeared. He was staring in my face. He was approximately 60 or 65 years old, had grey hair, moustache and small angry blue eyes. His face is the last thing I remember. Everything got blurry after that and I fell asleep again. When I woke up that morning, I was so confused. I thought maybe it was just a terrifyingly realistic dream?

Next night I slept like a baby so I thought may be I had a nightmare. Two month have past and everything was fine until I woke up again. Only this time in a car. I was sitting on the back sit and someone was holding my hand. I was too scared to look at the person. The car was moving really fast and in about 5 minutes it stopped. The driver opened a door for me. I got out and the woman fallowed me and she was the one holding my hand.  I looked around. We were somewhere in the field and there were a single house. It was small and wooden a typical village house. I began panicking again and the woman tolled me “don’t worry we just crossed the border. She took my hand again. We’ll be back home in no time” she said. She and the man (driver) lead me to the simple wooden house. The place it self looked like an abundant village house. We walked in. Three of us moved to the basement. It had no concrete floor but instead the flour was just a ground. There was a small wooden door in the ground. The man lifted the door and began taking out the bags of potatoes. When he finished, he picked me up and lowered me on the bottom of that emptied pit. The woman fallowed me and the man jumped there as well. I had to crawl through a small corridor on my hands and knees. It was too small to stand up. Suddenly I found my self in a small well lid room with nothing there. The man did something and suddenly the walls opened. It  was an elevator. All 3 of us stepped inside and elevator moved down. I don’t remember how long it took for us to get to the bottom. Probably 15 minutes but the elevator was moving down really fast. What I sow amazed me. There were a big facility and a lot of people. Some wearing white doctor coats and some had common cloth like me. There was a long table with different dishes on like a buffet and people were going to the table picking what they liked. The women sow me staring and said “You can eat later”. After that phrase everything got hazy again. I made a drawing of the tunnel.

When I woke up next morning I felt pain in my left eye. It almost felt like pain was inside of the eye. Obviously, this time I was freaked out. I just kept touching my eye I was so happy that it was there. I just felt such a strange relieve. I went to the mirror and stared at my self for a long time. Latter that day I began having a flash backs I remembered someone taking my eye out and putting it on the metal tray. Than took a vary long needle and inserted it in the hole where my eye used to be. I was awake and I could feel needle touching the inside of my head but I didn’t feel any pain. I remember feeling anxiety but the operator kept telling me that he will not give me my eye back because I’m not cooperating. The ware a human body parts hanging there on the wall, upon remembering that I cried for a long time. This is how it started, after those things got escalating worst. 

Over the years I saw a few different kinds of creatures. First ones were grey aliens. They were short, grey in color creature with bid heads and big black eyes.

later I remembered them, one of them operated on my eye. Also, grays tolled me how to cure all mental illnesses, from bed memory to schizophrenia. Let’s take a schizophrenia for example. They take the eye out and insert needle to the brain. Then they hit the brain with electricity to create double identity disorder in the person. Both identities made to be identical no one can ever see the deferens when person is switched on. But the second identity doesn’t have the schizophrenia yet it’s exactly the same personality as the original! Nothing is changed not a single traits. Then they block first identity (with schizophrenia) and volua! Person is cured. Ones gray alien trayed to teach me to move objects with my mind. What he did was, he had a liquid metal(mercury like) in a round sphere. It looked like a little fish swimming in a tank. It was easy to move. I would thing about it moving to the right and it would move. The gray told me that originally this metal was used for the animals to operate. For example they could teach a dog to build the simple metal parts, like wheels. The metal would do all the work by it self but someone has to manipulate it mentally. I wasn’t a good student no amount of working with this metal helped me develop a talent of moving the objects with my mind. Some people do master that and can move object with their minds but not me. I had a conversation with gray alien when he diagnosed me with being autistic. It’s strange but I wasn’t diagnosed with this when I was in kindergartens or school. A few years ago, I stayed in a place with gray aliens. There were black boxes like a coffins. they were filed with pink viscos fluid. In one of them was a man, he was around 65 years of age, very toll, with long gray hair. I don’t remember anything else. Also, there are a reptilian aliens. All grays working with reptilians are cruel and violent. Greys working against reptilians are almost the same, may be just a bit nicer. I saw both kinds many times. Reptilian aliens are dumb boring creatures that don’t deserve my time.

Long headed grey alien. I saw them a year after I met grey aliens for the first time. They were wearing capes. They have long oval heads but their eyes look like eyes of average grey alien. There skin is grey too and the same height as grey aliens. They get “average gray aliens” to do their dirty work for them.

One of the aliens I met in underground base looked like Gargoyle. It was a, jet black, bat like creature. It was a female about 7’5 ft tall with round red eye and wings. She was speaking telepathically and I just knew it was a female I don’t know how but I just knew. She had no breast or anything of that sort but at the same time she was very feminine. Gargoyle was suspicions of me. I touched her and her skin was cold, lathery and hard. She was revolted by me and told me how moist and disgusting my hand was. I asked her if I can touch her wing. She said no, then she half opened her wings and shacked them. Then she took a little sack and dusted the place where I touched her with something that looked like flour. I think this alien race afraid of water and instead of bathing they dust them self’s. I hope I will not see one agene. Because even through she didn’t try to attack me her hostility was obvious. I bet gargoyles are violent. 

Pleiadian aliens. The good looking humanoids with blond hair and blue eyes. They have 5 planets. One planet is entirely pleidian. The other planet they share with Praying mantis aliens. The 3-ed planet was full of people, just like the people we have on Earth. I liked Pleiadeans, they were very sweat. I was told that their school aged children study from 9:00 to 12:00 then the rest of the day teacher takes them to the beach. It’s an actual school program and they can’t say no to the beach. Water is very important to the pleidians. They can hold their breath for 20 minutes in the water.

The “Earth like aliens” I believe they are some type of pleiadians, some people are dark some white but they are all good-looking. Those human looking humanoids would come to me and just say stuff like “Why are you so ugly? Are you sick? Are you dyeing?” They bullied day light out of me. They act like some people on Earth.

Some of the pleiadian aliens were very strange. They were snow white, whiter than albinos on Earth. Their hair was very fine and thin, I could see tiny bold spots here and there. Take an average person divide their hair in three parts and you will get the amount of hair that one of those aliens has on their entire head. All female had a care hair cut and males had very shortly cut hair. All very straight. Also, I was looking at their arms I don’t think they have any body hair. Their skin is cold not like human at all. But the biggest difference is their eye. They don’t have a well-defined iris. The looked hazy, like a small grey cloud. Not a single one of them ever said a word to me physically or telepathically. I felt they were hostile and untrustworthy. 

One day I met a red-haired dwarf alien. His eyes were big and green, and his skin was a little bit orangish. Even through he was much smaller than me his hands were the same size as mine. I made a drawing of him. I saw him talking to reptilians. Reptilians were disrespectful towards the dwarf. I think they (reptilians) are violent to everything that moves. Also, it’s strange that some contactees find reptilians intelligent. I saw probably a few hundreds of reptilians by now, but not a singe one of them were intelligent. They act as people with autism, no mental flexibility what so ever. I spoke to a dwarf and he complimented me on my long nails. He said that on his planet the length of nails show a status. Only the males on his planet have long sharp nails. It’s to demonstrate power and high status. His nails were very long and sharp. He said that he was chosen for interbreeding program by reptilians. His race hates reptilians but has no chose.

Blond and red haired aliens- first a saw a female why looked like a human female. She was blond and blue eyed. She wasn’t wearing a cloth and I knottiest that her pubic hair and under arm hair was blood red. Her arms and legs were hairless. I wasn’t shore what was happening so I tried to put my jacket on her and she was trying to get away from me. She started to make “grrrrr” sound and suddenly a humanoid looking male came. He looked more alien then her. He was blond and blue eyed but he had a bright red line going from his lower lip to the neck. He had a small beard that was bright red and he had a small blood red freckles on his cheeks. He turned to female and I saw blood red hair on the back of his neck. I tried to touch his red hair and I pricked my finger. They were sharp like a bone. Their teeth are not like human teeth. They don’t have molars instead they have long sharp fangs. They can’t speak (physically or telepathically) but the sounds they make are like a barking of the dog. I don’t remember much about that encounter.

Blue haired aliens. I saw a group of 5 people: 3 men 1 women and 1 little girl. They looked like Indian native Americans/Canadians but with blue hair. There skin was the same color as earth natives and there eyes ware dark. All of them had long hair they all were wearing cloth (thank God). There hair color was a little different from each other. Some had lighter blue hair some darker blue. The old man’s hair had strands of light purple and pink hair. I imagine this is how the gray hair looks like on them. Also, they had feathers in their hair just like real Indians. They were walking buy me with grey alien. I tried to touch little girl’s braid. One of the men noticed that. He tolled me telepathically that it’s insult to touch a hair of the child. Only her mother can do it. I never sew them again. They seemed scared by me.

A few years ago. I met a strange kind of aliens. They were tall with horns that look like a horns of a deer and their faces looked somewhat like a deer’. They were wearing long bright red capes. This took place in a forest on a dark starry night. Capes looked like they were burning but they wasn’t. I jumped on one of them to see what would happened that’s how I know that capes aren’t really burning. They were walking one after the other in a long row, there were may be 20 or 25 of them. The one on who’s cape I was jumping on, turned around and put me in front of him self, so we all were in one row.I could here his thoughts he was thinking that as long as I’m quit and don’t disturb anyone it was ok. He was thinking that if I had a horns it would look nice on me. small creature with big horns it would look beautifully. They were performing some kind of ritual.

Little blue gray alien. He looked exactly like grey alien except he was light blue and  smaller. He showed me how our planet used to look like. He called it Terra. He would say” I can show you how Terra used to look like. Everything was blue even rocks. I wander if blue aliens originated here? I told him to come and visit me but he said his people don’t come to this planet anymore because it’s too hot. Too hot to live or function. Also he told me that our temperatures, his and mine, are so different that if we touch it could injure both of us. Also, he told me that his race is superior to grays and than grays hate his race.

I remember giant kids. They looked very human except for their height. They were around 8 or 9 years old and all of them were bigger them me. We were playing. We played a catch. I was trying to chase them, but I could never run as fast as they could the size difference was too match. I never seen any adults and it was the first and the last time I saw them. But then again my memory is not good.

Gray alien but with triangle-shaped head.

The gray aliens with triangle-shaped heads are a lot angrier than regular grays. 

The one I was talking to is a pilot. He said that he is a grandson of the alien commander who dropped a bomb on Earth a long time ago, destroying dinosaurs. The one that we believe to be an asteroid. Also, this alien told me a few things about Mars. He called Mars a planet with 2 oceans.

I met a cute dinosaur. He looked like t-rex but a lot smaller. He spoke telepathically. Reptilians had him in a cage. he asked me to let him out, he said he will kill all of them when he’s out. But I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t open that cage. He was very unhappy because he was cold all the time, so I would put my hand on his nose to worm him up. He wanted me to seat on his head. All cold blooded creatures just love when something worm is on their head. He was truly suffering there. I had a filing that reptilians will kill him soon.

Birds living in a toilet. I believe this did not happened on Earth. I was brought to a place, a house. It had an old fashioned toilet, basically a small wooden shack outside. I never used a toilet because there were birds living there. They were about 8 cm long flat with triangular straight wings. They looked like a flat fish. They had both eyes on one side of the head and they were flat against the walls. They were blue and yellow I never heard them make a sound of fly. I was told they hunt for insects flying around the toilet.

Rodent alien. I saw this kind of creature just ones. He looked like a human and a rodent mixed. He had blue eyes and long dark brown straight hair. He had sweet voice and soft personality. I don’t remember any part of our conversation. All I remember is that I liked him.

The 6 eyed lizard. I was tolled by grey alien that I can’t touch it because those lizards are very sensitive. This lizard may stop eating and basically just starve it self if, it’s stressed. I don’t know if they are intelligent or not.

📷5

The 6 eyes amphibian.

It was another 6 eyed, reptilian looking creature but intelligent. He was huge and dark gray in color with yellow eyes. He was immersed in a mad and only his head was sticking out. The head was flat and really big. We talked telepathically. He said that he was kept there against his will and that he’s always cold and unhappy. He was insulted when I referred to him as reptilian. He insisted that amphibians are superior to reptilians. I walked on his head and set there for a while. He asked to bring this message to the world. He will take the side of anyone why will get him out of there. He will give away all of the secrets that he knows. I know that he’s just like me, will rut in there. None of us will ever get out.

The feline aliens. Friendly but surprisingly unattractive creatures. I saw them but don’t remember any communication with them. The first one I met was hurry with flattened face. Parochially 5’2 ft. in height. The second feline was sphinx cat. She was toll, hairless about a head taller than me. she was sweet and gentle. She stood straight up on two back legs. I don’t remember any communication but I remember thinking that she was lovely.

Small green aliens.

I saw about 5 of them. Small 70 inch high alliance with triangular heads. They were talking to me about hybrid babies. I said no and start screaming at them. They all got scared and one of them said, ok ok just go away. I never saw them again. They seems to be benevolent. 

Triangle headed alien. 

I don’t remember when was the first time I saw them but they gave me a lot of important information. One of them claimed to be a grandson on former “watcher”. Watching and controlling the reality on earth. I was told his grandfather blasted the earth, destroying the dinosaurs. What we believe was asteroid. The dinosaurs was unruly and if humans are unruly they just going to destroy us. The triangle headed alien a crossbred between greys and insectoids. They have those hard teeth like plates in their mouth. The above mentioned alien showed me pyramid. Huge dark pyramid. He said the reality is projected out of the hole located on top of pyramid. I was explained that the pyramid is actually a clock and reality controlled by time. I was kind of glad it wasn’t S. the one controlling this thing. I was beginning the alien to use it against S. and he just laugh at me. 

The black-eyed children. Usually people meet them when they come to their houses late at night asking to come in. sometimes people see the black car and a man in hat, dressed in black weighting for them. There are 3 elements to that: the black eyed child (demon), the thing covered in wires (the man in a hat) and triangle-headed aliens. I don’t know if the thing coved in wires a person, a robot, an alien or demon. They look alive to me but wires confuse me, also I never heard them talk. Black eyed children and man in a hat obey triangle headed aliens. Black eyed children confuse me too. Sometimes they smell like sulfur but I met many many demons before and they don’t smell like that. However sometimes S smells like that. That led me to conclusion that only those possessing physical bodies smell of sulfur. Sometimes black eyed children would come to me raise their arms and ask to pick them up. One time I got really sick so triangled headed alien kicked me out. Another important element is the car. The man in a hat drive the same car as in the beginning of my store. It’s a black insanely fast car that is invisible when it rides and becomes visible only when it stopes.

Mother snake. I believe the reptilians brought me to her (I might be wrong). She was huge white cobra. She was hiding in the cave and did not want to get out because it was too sunny. The cave was dry and smelled like dirt. I didn’t have to go deep. She was looking just like cobra but huge and white with reddish eyes. Like all cold blooded creatures she just loved when I set on her. I had so many of them ask me for them. I think the sun hurt her because she’s albino but she still wanted something warm. We had a conversation and I don’t remember a single word. There is absolutely nothing I can remember about that conversation. She was gentle. Ones again I don’t remember our conversation.

White gargoyles

They looked different than the black gargoyles I saw before. They were smaller, white and their faces were wrinkly. One of them told me “we’re pigeons, like a pigeon of piece”. There were 3 of them. They were singing with strange but beautiful voices. I have a mixed fillings about them. Don’t know if they are benevolent or not.

Praying mantis. I saw them many times. The first time I met a Praying mantis he referred to my hair as a” dead matter”. Praying mantis was scared by appearance of my hair. He said it looks threatening so he come up to me and started to chow my hair. I was confused so I let him. After he was done my hair was hard and ropy. I guess their saliva is like a glue. I asked them from which planet they came from. One of them said it called “Loochina”. It was a creepy encounter because the praying mantis was asking me for sex and when I said no he would walk after me and continued asking ,it wasn’t aggressive thou. He sounds like a 5 year old asking for candy and couldn’t understand why he wasn’t given any. After sometime he got tired from asking and went for a different tactic. They build houses from mud with many different opening. They go and admire differences in structure. Mantises have dancing competitions. I have to say it’s one of the scariest thing I saw. Their baby’s are transparent when they borne.

Tall grey aliens. One ward to describe them is “evil”. They are about 7 ft. tall and skinny. Their skin is grey and their eyes are like eyes of other grey aliens. They help reptilians. Now reptilians eat both human and grey alien meat but it doesn’t stop toll grey aliens. I saw tall grey aliens about 5 or 6 times. All of them were really aggressive. They have tones of swastikas everywhere. Also there is interesting story attached to that apparently they stall this symbol from grey aliens. Toll grey aliens and reptilians are related. I believe toll greys are result of interbreeding between reptilians and greys. So it’s not surprising that they like the same people, like Andre Pero for instance. They abscessed with him. They actually build a statue of him on the base in Mexico. Now toll grey aliens retarded emotionally but unfortunately not mentally. I never met Mr. Pero but I know his son Adam. Adam can shape shift into reptilian form. He sort of looks like his father but with black hair. He showed me a picture of Mr. Pero and his (Adam’s) mother. Later I meat her, can’t say mach about her a typical psychopath, like all reptilians I met before. He told me that Mr. Pero and he will attempting to kill her together. I haven’t seen him since 2012.

aliens,"Its a slow period for UFO/alien news as far as disclosure goes.  I had a conversation with a skeptical friend who looks at me like I have a penis in between my eyeballs when I bring up aliens.  I guess to some skeptics, they can't even wrap their minds around the possibility of alien life and/or their interactions here on Earth.  I figured that I would compile a lists of reasons why I believe that there has to be alien life out there.  Its going to be a long one, but I will try my best to make it as easy to read as possible.  

**HISTORY:**

As a lot of us know, there have been MANY historical events that hint towards aliens.  There was just a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/ovlz1y/hadnt_heard_about_this_one/) here today about the Nuremburg incident in 1561.  A black triangular object, hundreds of spheres and cylinders that moved erratically in the sky, etc..  All of this in 1561.  And that isn't even the beginning of it.

There is a list of UFO sightings throughout history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings).  Is it Wikipedia?  Yes.  Am I still going to read it and post about it?  Also yes.

An area and point in history that spikes my curiosity is Ancient Egypt.  I still am in the group of people that thinks that they at least had ""help"" from extraterrestrials in the construction of the pyramids.  The time frame in which those things were built PLUS the fact that the Great Pyramid of Giza is oriented perfectly on Earth's true North is insane to me.  How an ancient civilization could do all of that in the around 20 years truly boggles my mind.  Now, am I also a bit of an idiot?  The answer is also yes. 

There is more ""evidence"" in history.  Odd hieroglyphics, UFOs in very old paintings, UFO stories and sightings throughout history, and more.

I may have gotten to this one based off of my own thoughts and thought process, but I truly believe that a lot of religions have to do with extraterrestrials/interdimensional beings.  Whichever tickles your fancy because, like religion, we still have no publicly known evidence of either being real. 

**ROSWELL:**

No matter how old or tired the story is, it doesn't make sense (to me) how people can buy the official story.  Its laughable how anyone can call someone crazy for believing that it was an alien craft that crashed and was recovered by the US military.  

So lets get this straight.  An object crashes and a random rancher noticed the debris.  He reports it to authorities who then put out a press release saying that they have recovered a ""flying disc"".  There are many reports of bodies being recovered as well.  The military recovers the debris, then all of a sudden the release is changed to a downed weather balloon and test dummies that were dropped from the sky THANK YOU GOODNIGHT!  

Sorry, chief, I just don't buy it.

**COVERUPS:**

To save you from having to read more of my horrible writing, I want to just talk about the fact that coverups have even existed around the alien/UFO topic.  Not any specific ones, other than Roswell, just as a whole.  

I know that now people are hanging on the nuts of some politicians and military people who are now acknowledging the existence of UFOs, but let's not forget the 70+ years that they made all of us look like lunatics by pretending that its ridiculous and all some big fairytale.  70+ YEARS and they are acting like UFOs are this wild new thing that only started happening in 2004 with the Tic Tac.  

You don't find that odd?  If alien life and UFOs were all just figments of crazy people's imaginations then why the EXTREME secrecy?  Why cover all of the documents in black boxes?  Why have there been such a large amount of ex-government and ex-military people coming out talking about UFOs and extraterrestrials for decades?  Are every single one of them lying?  I mean you even have astronauts coming out and saying stuff about it.

Now onto NASA.  In my humble opinion, they are one of the worst offenders of covering things up.  Before I go into it, just know that my brain is not completely smooth.  I do understand that a lot of the ""UFOs"" that are seen in space videos are just ice or space junk.  I also understand that because some dumb dumb saw some weird thing on a picture of the moon doesn't always mean that it is an alien base or something.  I do, however, think that its a little strange that there are a lot of convenient black squares on Google Earth and Google Moon (or whatever its called).  I also find it odd that, for years now, live feeds from space tend to get ""cut off"" at very convenient times.  Just when something comes into frame the live feed cuts out and we get blueballed.  Again it could be ice or whatever and all just be a big coincidence, but I have a hard time believing it.

I also find it odd that we don't have cameras pointing away from the Earth in space.  Now it may sound stupid to have something like that because it would be mostly a black screen, but remember that there is a Tesla floating into the void right now because Elon thought it would be cool.  This point is not as good as my other ones, but it is a thought.  Maybe not a good thought, but a thought nonetheless. 

**BASIC SCIENCE:**

I bring this point up a lot, but it needs to be said constantly because we are very ignorant and close minded.  Based only on what we know now, there are about 10 septillion planets, about 1 billion trillion stars, and an estimated hundreds of billions of galaxies in the observable universe.  The universe has been around for about 14 billion years.  Scientists have estimated about 10 dimensions that the universe operates on.  

With all of that in mind, to think that we are, always have been, and will always be the only intelligent life in the universe could be the dumbest theory of all time.  I get it.  Some people are so enclosed into their daily lives with jobs/kids/whatever, so they barely ever think about this.  But there are people like me out there who think about it constantly.  I want to know what's out there, whether their intentions are good, evil, or neutral.  

**CONCLUSION:**

There is much more that I could write about, but I know this post dragged on and bordered on rambling.  To bring it back to the conversation with my friend and the other conversations that I have had with skeptics, it is ignorant to dismiss arguments for alien life.  It is even more ignorant to act like it people on our side do not have a solid argument just because it sounds unreal.  

Like the great Patrice O'Neal said:

&gt;""If you tell me 2 + 2 is 4, and I know it is, then you... shove marbles up your ass, I go 'Damn, Anthony shoves marbles in his ass?' But the fact that you shove marbles in your ass doesn't invalidate 2 + 2 = 4.""",What makes me KNOW that there is something to the whole alien thing

aliens,"Lue Elizondo's [Unidentified: UFOs in the Headlines](https://www.history.com/specials/unidentified-ufos-in-the-headlines) is an excellent follow-up to [The Phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onEXmLX2ZZQ). In about an 1 hour and 22 mins, Lue Elizondo and team attempt to touch on key points from the Pentagon's [unclassified preliminary assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf) on UAP. In order to further propel their claim:

**""UAP are real and they are of Unknown Origin.""**

For instance, since they cannot provide the classified evidence of the (143) unidentified cases. What they do instead is, that they show you some key reports from retired USA military personnel. People who have allegedly witnessed some weird shit in the skies, which compelled them to come forward and tell their story to Lue on his show ""Unidentified."" To illustrate what perhaps some of the (143) unidentified cases may look like, to give you a sense of how bizarre and outlandish these claims are. They show some recreations based the eye-witness accounts. It is not much, but it is something very compelling. (For Example: [Omar Lara's testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCFXxN_Zpg4)).

Another key-point which they later bring up is the whole '[Mirage Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srtrRbt77AE)' angle. Where a former CIA agent, Richard C. Doty reveals how he deliberately injected misinformation into the UFO community via the media, or misinformation fed to UFOlogists. All this, in order to muddy the waters of the world of UFO sightings. The implication is, for instance, that the stories you hear on tabloids or the fantastic shit which you sometimes hear UFO researchers say, it may very well be some form of misinformation. However, Rick highlights that **NOT all of it is misinformation**.

It is stated that about 20% out the 100% of the information ""put out there"" on UFOs is true and that the other 80% is bullshit. However, 20% out of the information, being true, is still a significant percentage. This creates a problem for UFOlogists. How do they know what may be true and what is misinformation? Furthermore, how do they know what they believe NOT to be bullshit, How do they know is good information? How do they sort the ""bullshit"" out from ""what may be credible""?

Well, Lue Elizondo has highlighted a very good tool to use for discerning the truth from the bullshit. This tool is called [the (5) observables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sstBSuXIW0I) \- For reference:

1. **Positive Lift or Anti-Gravity:** The ability to fly without apparent means of propulsion or lift.
2. **Instantaneous Acceleration:** The ability for a craft to reach a high rate of speed in a short amount of time.
3. **Hypersonic Velocities:** A craft's Ability to reach speeds of 3,700 miles per hour (5x the Speed of Sound). Without emitting a ""sonic boom.""
4. **Low-Observability:** A craft's ability to conceal itself from any kind of radar.
5. **Trans-medium Travel:** A craft's ability to move seamlessly through space, air and water.

Why is this tool important? Well, because Lue Elizondo himself, used it to help determine what may be properly classified as UAP. Not all of these observables have to be present. But the descriptions which lead to the presence of any of these observables, is used to categorize something which may probably NOT be bullshit. Particularly, something observed by military personnel. Which is what limitation, Lue Elizondo had while working on ATTIP. The program wasn't set-up to gather sightings from the public masses. It was set-up to gather sightings within the military. For instance, the USA Navy.

Let's say that you dismiss all of the sightings from the past 70+ years and call them all bullshit. Because you don't want to dig up and figure out what ""may be true."" Let's say that you, however, believe that [the videos authenticated by the Pentagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO_M0hLlJ-Q). Let's say that those are of real UAP. Let's entertain that thought.

So, this brings up a very good point. This documentary's target audience is a very particular viewer: The ""Skeptical"" Believer who is most skeptical about UAP being of ""Unknown Origin."" Someone ""who believes"" that the answer to the UAP Mystery is: **""The Phenomenon is nothing but man-made technology and furthermore it is American made.""**

What Lue and team present you in about 1 hour or so. All of it, leads to this point. It's almost like a very good mind-fuck. Because **this documentary requires the viewer to accept that the (5) observables are based on something which is in fact, ""real."" In other words,  you cannot get into this debate without admitting or accepting that UAP are real. Period.**

Now, what is the origin of UAP? IF they are, in fact, manmade secret tech? Are they Chinese or Russian? The documentary presents the viewer with reasons WHY Lue and team, based on their expertise, as well as observations by experts which they have consulted with. That they do not believe it to be so. They DO NOT believe that America's ""adversaries"" have somehow leapfrogged and acquired incredibly advanced technology which would account for objects over the skies, underwater and in space capable of demonstrating all (5) observables. Let alone some of them. Because in essence, the (5) Observables are nothing short of extraordinary.

One point which they use here, is that currently the US military is in possession of the most advanced manmade military tech on the face of the planet. So then, for anyone who claims that this is, in-fact manmade technology and furthermore that it is American. Then they fall into a slippery slope. In other words, Lue Elizondo is saying **""To push the idea that this advanced tech is manmade is a more extraordinary claim than to say that this advanced tech is of unknown origin.""**

The slippery slope is as follows: ""**IF this is ""secret"" US tech. The USA has been developing it for over 70+ years now.""** WHY? Well, because you can actually go back and find some of the (5) observables present throughout several of the eye-witness accounts from decades ago all the way to most recently. They are there in the sightings. Not only in the USA, but all over the world.

**Fact: The UAP is a Global Phenomenon. Period.**

So, you are also saying that: **""The USA has tested this advanced tech all over the world. Including over the skies of its allies and adversaries.""** If this is so, why not use this tech for tactical advantage? Why even keep it ""hidden."" Are you sure that they have done a good job at keeping it hidden? When these things are known to light up like a Xmas Tree? **Do you realize that owning this technology would allow anyone on this planet to ""get in, do their bidding and get out"" without the fear of being caught?** Do you seriously think that any nation would keep such technology in their arsenal, and NOT use it to their advantage? Do you really think that the USA would do that? **Furthermore, UAP are capable of shutting down nukes. Who would hold back on using such tech against their adversaries?""**

**And if you do believe this slippery slope to be true. Then Lue Elizondo is placing the tinfoil hat over your head.**",How 'Lue Elizondo and Team' Presented Their Case Against UAP Being Manmade Technology Discussion

aliens,"I have been a citizen historian going on 15 years now. I started to get into into it specific studies of history as I approached retirement age. Reading the Classics like Homer, Plato, Herodotus, Hesiod, etc, etc. and searching various time periods in history, the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Romans, steppe culture, at first and for many years full blown college lectures from the Great Courses series or the Modern Scholar. From many different professors, Professor Jenifer Tobin has an excellent audio lecture regarding: From Troy to Constantinople: Cities and Societies of Ancient Turkey, she is an excellent orator. Another excellent lecture by Jennifer Tobin is: Grandeur That Was Rome: Roman Art and Archaeology.

However my problem was I kept going further and further back into History. [Eric H. Cline: 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Unabridged)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1177_B.C.:_The_Year_Civilization_Collapsed). Searching for information about the Bronze Age collapse, the Sea Peoples, etc.

However I was stumped in going back to the earliest days of writing because from out of nowhere appears the Sumerians, in academic circles it has been informally referred to over the past 75-100 years as ""[the Sumerian problem](https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/saoc4.pdf)"" Where did these people come from, who where they, how did they know so much, our modern society is actually based on all things Sumerian and not many people are aware of this. And what happened to them because quite honestly they disappeared following a very significant war.

I'll touch on Vedic scripture because I believe they were a sister civilization to the Sumerians but the topic is very deep, and it is problematic because of difficulties with the understanding of Hindi language compared to english. Same timeline roughly however, and close in regional proximity.

Listen or read [Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science from the Babylonians to the Mayans by author Dick Teresi](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lost_Discoveries.html?id=pheL_ubbXD0C&amp;source=kp_book_description) for a broader overview as to the similarities between the two. Ancient India was also devastated by an epic war. Sumer and India shared very significant mathematic sciences in Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus not widely accepted in other parts of the world.... yet shared with Egypt. When you look into the Greek scholar Copernicus even he did not understand Algebra, his studies were best explained in common language and utilized Geometry when advanced Algebra provides the best solution.

I am not going to go into Zecharia Sitchin stuff because he has been widely discredited and I think he was trying to make due with the best of his understanding with what he had.

In researching anything ""Sumerian"" very quickly it goes from the foundering of Sumer to the wider Mesopotamian, and Babylonian civilization and these are not the same things. Any researcher will quickly skim over Sumerian history and then get into the meat and potatoes of the latter two. What has been going on is it obscures history, one versus the other.

This is where gods began, they were the gods, the supreme deities commonly referred to as the [Anunnaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki). Before kings they (the anunnaki gods) ruled a very small and limited human population by appointing priests, this was even before the advent of kings. This history is referenced to go back far into ancient history and often characterized as the ""fictional antediluvian kings"" pre-flood. However with the advent of modern science we are now coming to understand there may have very well been a great flood and it is dated to around 11,900 years ago.

Notwithstanding this if one looks to India and Vedic scripture there are many similarities, yet completely different written and spoken languages. Physical places are the same yet in various languages and regions they have different names. This touches upon the Tower Of Babel myth. Make it difficult for humans to communicate and they will never understand each other, in fact they will war with each. There is a very brilliant scholar, an Indian-American out there right now discussing Indian history and Vedic scripture but again the language barrier arises. Check out Nilesh Oak: [Timeline of 17000+ Years of Unbroken Indian Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tsyzrDg2n4)

The entire idea of worship, in early hebrew to worship meant to work for, human did not so much as worship the gods as work for them. It is a true rabbit hole, and requires one to engage on their own path. If you get into Roman gods, Greek gods, Egyptian gods, Mesoamerican gods, Hindu gods, even the creation myths of China are shared, they all seem to share similarities with the original Anunnaki gods. It is a real rabbit hole. And it is very difficult to get answers or be taken serious by anyone in academia, they do not provide answers, only ridicule.

This topic is widely ridiculed and I often have to say I have not made it up, it is not fiction. We go from the Enūma Eliš roughly dated to 2,000 BC and yet human history in the region reflects areas such as Çatalhöyük which has recently been eclipsed by Göbekli Tepe. With Göbekli Tepe it is coming to light that in the region there may be several sites which date to the time period of Göbekli Tepe. 11,000 years ago. Example: [30 Gobekli Tepe Area Sites | Civilization Began 12,000+ Years Ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3ME7uVn2qs&amp;t=270s)

Babylonian myths were greatly influenced by the Sumerian religion however one is not the other, Sumerian is much much older and actually predates written language. What I do know or have learned is the meaning behind the Anunnaki is ""those who came to earth from the heavens"".

In studying recent papers that have come from the Max Planck Institute, and it's various genetic departments in searching for genetic origin it has been stated that the answer as to what human populations came from where and when, going back far enough may never be known.

The Sumerian kings list dates 475,000 years of human history. How is this possible? In the movie Interstellar time dilation was discussed, One year of space travel could pass for me, whereas you here on Earth would experience ten years of time going by. This is not something I have researched greatly. But with this being the case it allows for the Sumerian Kings list to make more sense than it has in the past. Time dilation is a thing. I leave on a one year space journey for me, come back to Earth 25 years have passed on earth. My children end up older than I.

Since lights in the sky have been a thing since the earliest days of humanity, and considering the myths that exist that god created man, even going so far as stating that woman was created from man by a genetic sample (such as the rib of Adam) it opens up a wide array of possible questions and possible answers. That being said, were early earthly hominids modified by advanced hominids that descended to earth from the heavens??? And specifically created in batches, and were these genetically modified human batches placed in various areas of the planet creating what we refer to as different races, under the fiefdoms of various gods which make up the [Sumerian pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_religion) and yet are we also the same? Is the Planet Earth an experiment? What are UFO's even doing here? and why?

Keep in mind this is not fiction nor have I made it up. And what is going on with the myths of gods mating with the daughters of men? Again, written myth, but is myth real and not myth? In the context of all that I have said, why am I discussing it at all. I have not made up the subject of UFO's and none of those important questions are being answered.

Big problem with UFO researchers is they talk about something very specific and then stray into an area such a bigfoot, or giants, and then are widely discredited. However recently with the announcement of the ""Dragon Man"" skull out of China, that unidentified hominid has not been genetically identified but was huge in life. Or the teeth samples recovered from Denisovans hominids, they are huge compared to modern humans..... huge even compared to Neanderthals, so as I said it is a rabbit hole, were these hominids the [Igigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igigi)?

aliens,"I just wanted to add a bit regarding disclosure. During your lifetime, there will never be official disclosure. Before the UAP report came out in June, if you were to search UFO disclosure at any point up to that date like I did, you would see that the exact same report as far as the videos came out in 2017,  2019, and 2020 in major news media sources. Now when you search this on google you are flooded with several news reports that have been released since then. This is very obvious that the world is trying to release the same information over and over again, maybe reworded, to see how the public reacts. How the public reacts each time will fuel the overall need or no need to disclose more information. If we continue on this path of forgetfulness/fear of dealing with uncomfortable thoughts or feelings/social gaslighting/religious denial and fear of ET existence, the world as a whole will never get disclosure.

Trailer - [https://youtu.be/CRK6IA--Swk](https://youtu.be/CRK6IA--Swk)

Had a vivid and memorable dream about it early this morning, as well, not that it means anything, but it was very interesting. 

I'm not sure what to think about what they experienced and saw, and why if they were supposed to make actual contact, it never really happened, only with lights and lighted objects at a distance. That seemed or appeared compelling, but left the question of actual contact, unanswered.

I never knew that Greer was into this since the 80's? late 70's even? 

I always wondered why or how this guy, this dude, without any significant background or creds seemed to be accepted and taken seriously by a variety of people in well-placed circles of power including in the aerospace and MICm CIA, Pentagon etc. 

Why was he meeting with General so and so in 98 or whatever, you get the idea. 

It gives it all a certain weight or air of credibility, but I'm still rather skeptical. 

Nevertheless, I surfed around a bit on the CE-5 ""protocols"", and I even ordered the guide

[https://www.amazon.com/Ce-5-Handbook-Easy-Use-Extraterrestrial/dp/1999425502](https://www.amazon.com/Ce-5-Handbook-Easy-Use-Extraterrestrial/dp/1999425502)

more for a gag to show a friend (when I saw the cover), than anything serious at all, but if I do see one, which I've always wanted to from childhood to this day, then I'll form a local chapter in my area which isn't far from an existing one in the nearest city. 

These days we can use all the help and what I'd call ""witnessing"" that we can get. The more eyeballs (or their equivalent) on the problems we face, the better. 

Some caution to be careful because you never know what you might ""invite"" in or to pay you attention, some of which could be unwanted, so I'm also a little leery on that note as well, although I honestly believe that nothing can harm me, as a Christian believer, which could be a subject I'd like to discuss with them, as it relates to our human condition as it is here on Earth, as a veil of tears and source of much suffering and evil. 

I like the idea of narcing out the PTB here on Earth, who wish to paint them as a dire threat to our security and way of life, because it it would be that, for them and the current status quo system and structure. 

That said, I don't wish to be painted as a UFO kook if I do try the protocols, say with a friend or two, and have any actual success, but I'm at the point where I don't really give a shit any more what people might think. If successful, it could be important. 

Then again, I don't want some interdimensional demon on my ass or my back either &amp; have to go through some sort of dark night of the soul to get rid of it. 

I'm only half joking, half serious, but was very curious about what other people think about this, particularly in light of recent UAP reports &amp; the notion that the shadow government might not be the best ""ambassadors"" to intelligent life in the universe, given what we generally know about the heartless and in some cases, satanic ways, in which they operate &amp; that infests and corrupts their hearts. 

Plus meditation can't hurt or projecting a smiling face from Earth who has no wicked agenda and that isn't interested in things like divide and conquer, domination and submission. 

Greer's hypothesis, that any sufficiently advanced civilization with the ability to traverse time and space, must be more evolved, in every way, and therefore benevolent and not malevolent towards us, is probably right, or we wouldn't be here right now, certainly not with what ""they've"" observed over the course of the last 120 years or so. 

It is utter nonsense and foolishness, or part of the solution as the film suggests, to attempt contact in some form or another, but without all the fake channeling BS and false narratives and fanciful stories that crazy UFO buffs do spout, where you know full well they're making it all up for attention, although some are very credible.

aliens,"INTRODUCTION 

When I was younger, I was in contact with a group of extraterrestrials I call The Others. My memory of them, the experiences that we shared and the memories of everything involving extraterrestrials is faint but every day it becomes clearer and as it becomes clearer some details turn out to be different than to what I had originally perceived them to be. This is an account of my clearest experiences. 

I remember being told by The Others that I had been abducted since birth by different species, though I assume not by them due to their honesty and due to their  apparent nature. I remember a variety of different species, from the Nordics, to a species that had deep sunken uncaring eyes and a beard that had the appearance of tentacles. I imagine these abductions had temporarily stopped due to the fact that I was sick with a variety of life threatening illnesses including Leukaemia from when I was around 3 with a possible break from illness when I was around 4. I remember the last abductions happening and The Others arriving at the very end of them just before I was in full remission. I also remember left under circumstances I am unsure of 4 - 6 weeks before my 6th birthday. 

I know what you are thinking "" You were on so many drugs that you would not know what is real and what is not "". You could even double down on this with the fact that none of my family, who interacted with these lifeforms, remembers anything. I will give you a few reasons (You may call them excuses if you please) why it was, without a doubt, real: 

[  ] By the time all of this started, I was nearly in remission from all diseases that I had previously suffered from therefore anything that could have caused hallucinations would have been used minimally and would not cause anything to anything of such severity if it were even possible in the first place. 

[  ] Although the drugs that are used to combat such illnesses can cause vivid hallucinations, I do not believe that they can cause hallucinations that are as consistent with each other as these,  and with this consistence forming a very long timeline and series of events that connect to each other just as happens in day to day life. Not to mention, real people cannot interact with hallucinations and my family interacted with these extraterrestrials. 

[  ] This one you could consider more of an excuse than the rest but I must include it. For whatever reasons The Others erased all memories that my family had of our adventures and experiences involving extraterrestrial lifeforms.

[  ] My mother, one of my brothers, my mother's friend and her three children all had a potentially coincidental experience around 2 years after the aforementioned events involving a UFO in broad daylight that all members of the party remember. 

If all of this does not convince you, then I cannot change your opinion and you may treat the rest of this account, should you choose to read it, as science fiction. If however, if this does convince you or you never doubted the legitimacy of this account in the first place, then please treat this as a truthful account of someone who has had an extraordinary experience and hopes that things will be the same again, one day. 

For context, I live in Australia. I used to live in a rural town, although we had plenty of neighbours. How any of this took place without anyone else noticing, I do not know.





CHAPTER 1: ABDUCTION 

At this point in time, I remember little of my abductions compared to the amount that I believe had happened but I will tell you what I do remember. The most vivid abduction, which itself is not very clear, is the one I will tell. 

I must have been around 4 when I was playing outside and saw a blue orb that looked like it was made of glass. It would watch me and fly in different ways and sometimes get very close only to fly just out of reach when I tried to touch it. Every time I would try to show my brothers or mother or shout for someone to look at it, it would fly away. One day however, it allowed my brothers to see it and they were dumbfounded as to what it could be, although I am sure they had a good idea. It having the appearance of glass, we could see right through it. It had what looked like wires right in the centre and a lens on the outer part of the device. I think that one or both my brothers suggested that I stay away from it and that we go inside. I do not think our mother believed us. 

I woke up somewhere cold, somewhere I now know to be a spacecraft or something similiar. I say something similar because I remember seeing windows and light coming in, but no sun rays. This could have meant that we were still on Earth. It could just as easily have meant that we were on another planet or at an angle in space that the light from the sun or whatever star we were near made it appear as though we were on a planet. I remember little else of the ship. 

I remember seeing blue bald beings, with sunken uncaring eyes and what appeared to be tentacles in place of a beard. For a mouth there was a slit and with it they made clicking and gurgling sounds which I now believe to be their form of communication. Both hands had roughly 10 fingers each, every one incredibly long, maybe identical in size to one another. Each finger had an object similiar to wire wrapped around it, these wires I imagine were attached to some kind of machine. They would pull their fingers, with the wires attached, up and down similar to playing a piano, which is why I call these beings "" Pianists "". They made a terrifying guttural yelling sound when I would do something that they did not like, however this may just be a false memory associated with the fear I had experienced. 

I assume this to be a separate experience as the architecture was completely different from the craft, my memory of said craft limited though it may be. It is also possible that this was the same experience and this second location was where we were traversing to in the assumed to be spacecraft. Believing them to be children like me, due to their size, I asked what was happening and various such questions but I got no response. I was sometimes moved away from the Greys by the Pianists as to stop interrupting their work. 

I remember waking up in bed and being terrified. I told my brothers about the people who had too many fingers and tentacles on their faces. They looked like they believed me. I do not remember much more when it comes to these beings.



CHAPTER 2: THE OTHERS 

I do not remember how we made contact with them but I do have a theory. I remember running, flashing lights and loud noises. I think they rescued me from an abduction, possibly orchestrated by the Pianists. I do know however that we made contact soon after or before I was in remission, so when I was 4 or 5. 

I assume that The Others were a rogue faction much like the Guardians Of The Galaxy from the movie of the same name due to never showing signs of working for a government, Extraterrestrial or otherwise. This is more likely if my theory about my rescue by them is true. If this is the case, I assume, due to my rescue at their hands, they decided to let my family be a part of the group, for lack of better phrasing. By this point, my mother obviously believed us. 

Their equipment, while vastly superior to ours, did not have the typical "" Alien "" look. Their equipment, from what I remember, did not look shiny and new nor did it glow or look white-washed. Everything looked DIY or manually made. 

There are a couple members who I vaguely remember though I will refer to them by nicknames due to not knowing their actual ones: 

[  ] Specs: I call him this because his looks might remind one of an engineer and because of the mask that he wore. He has mechanical arms that come from his back and wears all black aswell as a mask with lenses. I do not think I ever saw him outside of his usual attire and thus could not make out any features that his species might have. 

[  ] Macey: I remember her name being something similar to the aforementioned name. She was porcupine like, with what I can only describe as quills. She was about my size at the age I was then, if a bit taller. She had small hands that I believe were not the best at holding things and so I think she had tools specifically designed for her. 

[  ] The Boy: This particular extraterrestrial was about my size when I was 5 or taller. His skin was blue and he had facial tattoos. I remember being told that he was older than me and that was his natural height.

They would visit us regularly and show us many things. They would show us technology, talk about things outside our world, take us on trips outside our planet, sometimes only taking one of us and sometimes taking more. They would talk to us about our lives, do activities that we would. Although it sounds childish, they would even play games with us on our PS2 and sometimes without us. 

Their technology was amazing. They had their equivalent of phones and tablets, except they had unlimited battery life, which is, as you are about to find out, not even close to their most impressive technology. There was a ball which glowed with what looked like synapes and for all I know, this could have been their computer.  They showed us something that I do not quite remember but it involved floating water and it may have been something to how scientists can now make water float with vibrations. I also remember a small oval metallic looking stone that burned my hands when I touched it. 

I again, like the presumed Pianist space craft, do not know what the inside of their ship looked like nor where it was located or how they got to our house without anyone seeing them or their ship. What I do remember is when I went in the ship and I assume when any of my family went on the ship, I had to wear a strange heavy vest and shoes. The vest was one of those DIY looking pieces of equipment I mentioned, not to say that it was but it was black, made of a very thick fabric and it may have been heavy. The shoes I do not remember much about other than they felt like they were filled with slime. 

Of my trips outside Earth, with and without my family I remember very little but I will say a few things. There was what looked like an Outpost with many different species gathering there for various purposes. I also remember my mother saying that I must never leave the group as this was uncharted territory for me and my family. 

Because of how much they frequented our house and how close my family became with The Others, they became what we considered family. 



CHAPTER 3: CLOWNS 

There is a particular cluster of vivid memories that are no more important than any other but are more confusing. This particular cluster of memories pertains to a variety of species of extraterrestrials and despite being different, they are all similar which is where the confusion sets in. I was, attacked by a member of one of these species but due to their familiarity I cannot discern which one did it. 

How are they similar you ask? They all resemble clowns and Jesters yet they all look completely different. Whether this is due to coincidence, genetic engineering, hybridisation or otherwise, I have no idea. 

I will do my best to separate the species that I remember into separate discernible groups to the best of my ability and assign each a nickname to make this easier: 

[  ] Koshare: The Pueblo people have a religion that involves tricksters called the Koshare. These trickster extraterrestrials look identical to this group, with coloured striped bodies and long giraffe like ears. 

[  ] Coloured Clowns: They looked like your typical Clown that you would see in a carnival. I do not remember any distinguishing features.

[  ] Clay Clowns: This group had what looked like the hat that is typical of jesters except it was a natural part of their head and due to the texture of their skin, they looked like they were made of wet clay. 

[  ] Clown Fish: This humanoid race evolved in an ocean environment. They have a hammer head shark like ridge on the top of their head that extenda down the sides of its head and hangs down to its shoulders or lower.  It has cable like appendages that hang from its nape to lower back. They are black and white and bleed black, the colouration most likely bring caused by deep ocean depths where light cannot reach them. If the evolution of this ocean species bearing a similar appearance to its land counterparts is a coincidence, I do not know, if it came from the same planet as them at all.  

[  ] Bendy: I only remember having seen one of its kind but it was one too many, that is if I am not mistaken and it is not a member of the aforementioned groups. It skin looked sickly, not like clay however which is the case of the Clay Clowns. It's limbs bent at angles impossible for the human arm and it could stretch to impossible distances which has led me to believe it does not have bones or at least not the kind that humans are accustomed to. Its clothes were thick and had thick material which gave its arms the appearance of fabric covered vacuum cleaner tubes. 

[  ] Prematorium: This one is named not due to a lack of a name but due to remembering a similar name mentioned in the same context as this being. Its appearance is almost like an amalgamation of all of the  aforementioned species. It has got a face that has either face paint that resembles either the kind of face paint a Jester would wear or natural markings. Its mouth was more like a hole that tightened than a humans mouth, which gave its lips the appearance of a swollen sphincter. It has a head the shape of a hat a Jester might wear and it was certainly not a hat as the points on the sides of the head moved individually for unknown reasons. The head was, however, covered with a material. It has many arms that I cannot fathom the need for. I do not remember the legs nor do I wish to. Its clothing was almost psychedelic with small squares spread across a grid that spanned all of the clothing, each square a different colour, only sometimes containing white or black. They also have feelers at the back of their throats that I believe they use to feed. I remember encountering it before the events told of in the preceding chapter but they are not clear.

The Others told me to not trust any Clown Species. Whether this is because nearly all known Clown species are untrustworthy by nature or The Others lack of trust is because of a small untrustworhty group is not known, though judging by my own experiences, I have to agree with the former. I do not know if any of these Clown species are from the same planet.



CHAPTER 4: FEAR 

The events that happen next, may not happen as I say they do, as the memories of these particular events keep merging into each other and separating into different events. 

I wake up one morning to the sounds of laughing and playing. I look outside to check and I see brightly coloured extraterrestrials playing in our backyard. I tell my mother and brother and we gather them inside so that the neighbours do not see them. I remember them being extremely excitable and would you believe it, tricksters. I think that they left on their own which left us all confused and me sad as I believed I was making friends with them. 

A different day, I remember playing in the backyard and decided to go to the side of the house. Here I saw an incredibly tall and grotesque looking being. It looked like he was made of pipes covered in insulated fabric and the only part of it that looked organic, was its head. I remember it tried to talk to us and showed off what it can do to impress us. We were terrified, however I remember wanting to be its friend. My family decided that it was too dangerous. They told me to take it to another room so that they could talk privately without it hearing. Essentially, they wanted it gone. 

They convinced me that it was dangerous and to kick it out. Its ""friend"" kicking it out seemed to make it angrier than it would have been had it just been my family. It screamed and raged and flung itself around the house, banging on the walls and roof and eventually it collapsed in the driveway. 

I do not know why but I too went into a fit of rage. I went outside and started yelling at it to leave and oddly, despite my age, I believe I even told it to ""FUCK OFF!"" multiple times. It began to cry harder and my rage dissolved instantly. I felt sorry for it. I tried to calm it down, I apologised and then I got closer. 

It looked up and I instantly felt fear. It spoke some strange language in a deep voice as it got closer and then it began to choke. It choked and then it got closer to me and I noticed what looked like a ball of copper wire at the back of its throat and decided that this was what was causing it to choke. I decided that, against all logic that I did not have as a 5 year old, I would try to pull it out. This ball of wire sprung out and stabbed into me and as it did so, his long arms wrapped around me and it launched its body, while holding onto me, into the air by stretching its legs. 

It looked me in the eye and I am sure that things happened that I do not remember. What I do remember, however, is that black ooze poured from every hole in its head and it sounded like it was mock crying. My family or The Others must have done something as its face froze and we both fell to the ground. I remember the wires being removed from my body, being pulled out from under the being and being carried to my bed by my brothers. I also remember one brother poking one of the black ooze covered eyes of Bendy. 

Here is where the confusion begins. The Prematorium, which I know existed due to other events, could just likely been the one that did this as opposed to Bendy. It could have been feelers coming from the throat of what attacked me as opposed to copper wire. An associate has mentioned that he himself has had an encounter with a Prematorium (although he does not use that name to refer to it) and has outlined that the Prematorium does not have black ooze but slime that pours from its face for unknown reasons that appears black due to lighting. It could also have been a Koshare with their long ear like appendages possibly being what had stretched as opposed to Bendy's arms, but this is unlikely as it seems against their personality and does not seem to fit. Another alternative, which is highly likely due to events that will be mentioned, is that Bendy was ""Built"" to incorporate some key features of the various clown species, those chosen for their own reasons or because they were the ones that caused me great unease and fear. With all of this known, I find it very likely that Bendy was definitely its own being and not a self - imposed screen memory in place of one of the aforementioned Clown Species. 

I had a nightmare. The Others and I were walking through a cave. I asked what we were doing, so I asked where we were and what we were doing and Macey told me to shut up. I repeated this question again with a harsher response. Eventually we stumbled upon a robed skeleton. They froze and told me to run. I asked why and they just repeated themselves. I walked over to it and it sprouted tentacles that flung into the walls and it said my name. It moved increasingly fast towards me with its tentacles grabbing onto the walls. 

I woke up and screamed. My family came running and I told them about the nightmare and thought that the reason I was in pain was because of the skeleton having attacked me. With enough convincing, I managed to get my brothers to show me where Bendy was. Bendy's body was piled up outside, underneath my window. I was terrified and felt very tired, both from exhaustion and pain and decided that I wanted to go back to my bed to sleep. 

I woke up to the sound of someone climbing my window and when I looked, I noticed two very long arms grasping my window. I noticed a head poking up above the bottom of the window, with an excited, wide mouthed grin staring right at me. I screamed louder than I ever have and as my family came running, Bendy ran away. My brothers explained that it was dead and that I saw the body and knew it was. They checked the body again and it was gone. 

I was not allowed outside for a few days, both for my safety and so that my wounds could heal without anyone asking questions. The Others asked me questions about it and I believe they said something about it being robotic and was a tool used for fear. 

A few days later, under the supervision of my brothers, I was allowed to play outside, which I did with them. I heard sounds coming from the top of the driveway, the view of which was blocked by the house. I decided that I would check what it was but I heard my brothers shouting after me to stop. I looked and there were two multi legged, multi armed things, who had spotted me and gave chase. I sprinted back inside and my brothers followed. We told our mother and we all panicked. We were too scared to leave. 

The Others arrived and ran inside. They explained to us, that these things were biologically engineered for search and destroy missions. They told us its name and although do not remember it, in do remember that it sounded similar to Prematorium, which means a Roman general, which coincidently fits the creature and its purpose. I imagine whatever sent these Prematoriums did so because of what we did to Bendy, the reason that Bendy was sent to us or both. I do have some very vague memory of angering a Clown Species. 

A smaller, less vivid set of memories, is that of a group of Clowns following me around whenever I was alone outside or just with my family. They would mock me, not for the purpose of pure annoyance but as a message, that message being that there is nothing that we could do to stop them. When we got too close to them, they would either run away or attack us violently forcing us to run or go back inside. I do not remember if they were around when The Others were at our house.

It is from these multiple Clown species that I believe the ideas and traditions of Jesters, aswell as the legends of tricksters came from. 



CHAPTER 5: MIND WIPE 

One day, I heard my family speaking with The Others outside and so I checked what was happening, as I found it unusual they were not inside. They said they had to leave and not come back for a while. My family were not happy and neither was I. They were surprised and shocked to see me standing outside at the top of the stairs, nearly crying. I ran back inside and they came in. 

They told me that they would be back one day but I was not mature enough to handle what was going on and that I had to grow up a bit first and then we could pick up where we left left off, without them leaving again. I asked if they could leave after my 6th birthday as it was only 6 weeks away and they declined. They had the idea that they could wipe my families memories and by the time I remembered, it would be nearly time for them to come back. I accepted this and they wiped all of our memories. 

Ever since the incident I have had a fear of colours associated with Jesters and clowns with no known explanations.



CHAPTER 6: AFTERMATH 

2 years later, my family, now remembering nothing of the previous events, were saying goodbye to a group of family friends when one of us noticed something in the sky. It was not bright enough to be the sun and it was not moving. We all stared at it when it darted to the left of the visible sky at lightning speed and then the right and then it vanished. We all decided that we should get inside and our friends went home. If this was pure coincidence and this had nothing to do with the previous events I do not know but I suspect it is more than that. 

Around 5 months before the date that I began writing this account, I was researching extraterrestrials out of boredom and curiosity when I got a flash in my mind of 2 uncqring eyes, staring at me from blue sunken eye sockets. Ever since then, I have gotten flashes of memories that have slowly become less flashes and more clear coherent memories.



CHAPTER 7: SHATTERED MEMORIES 

Although I have told you the bulk of the memories, there are some flashes of memories that still do not have a known story behind them. 

In one memory, I am in what looks like a helicopter and there is an an extraterrestrial in front of me. It is wearing what looks like a pilots mask. It removes the mask and a long pipe slips out of a hole in its face. This hole is the only other one other than the eye sockets I am not sure it had. 

In another memory, I am in a ginormous spacecraft. There are what looks like incredibly tall greys who are not wearing clothes and have very long fingers, walking around and using computer consoles. There are 2 small spiralling staircases that lead to a second floor at the back of the room. There are rooms and machines under the staircases. In front of these stair cases are two massive glass tubes that go from floor to ceiling and contain what looks like some kind of organic electricity producing plants which I suspect powered the ship. 

I have a memory of a being whose appearance was that of blue stone. To move, the stones that its body was comprised of, rapidly rearranged. It is possible that this being was artificial.

Another memory has a being that appears to be made of near paper thin metal and when it moves, the metallic body bends and one that watches may fear that it will break.

In this last memory, I am in a building on a strange planet and it is dusk. I am told not to go out of the city at night and am told to look through a telescope. When I look through the telescope, I see what looks like giant black insects that have very large mandibles.

aliens,"I'm sure most everyone here has at some point come across the UFO connection to Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Battelle. I've recently discovered yet another connection between the Air Force &amp; Battelle:  **Brigadier General Peter J. Hennessy.**

In Jaques Vallee's published journals (Forbidden Science 4), Jaques documents a [conversation between himself and CIA Officer Kit Green](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/odpva9/jacques_vallee_on_christopher_kit_green_i_of_ii/):

&gt;Vallee: “What about Colonel Hennessey? Bill Moore mentions him as the top guy above Doty, the man giving orders to Falcon.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Green: “I spoke to Hennessey; he swore he’d never met Doty or Moore.”

Doty, a former AFOSI counter-intelligence agent, is considered largely responsible for spreading disinformation through his involvement with the MJ12 and Serpo ""leaks"". (for more information on this, check out the documentary ""Mirage Men"" or search the sub for Doty)

This means Hennessey would've been directly involved in the disinformation campaigns Doty ran. That revelation on its own was interesting enough, but then I looked into Hennessey's military history. And [surprise surprise](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/106800/brigadier-general-peter-j-hennessey/):

**""April 1997 - September 1999, Deputy Director, Directorate of Plans and Programs, Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio""**

And then I looked up Hennessey's post-military [work history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-hennessey-98a03a27):

**“Vice President, Business Development, Battelle”**

Idk what to make of this information, but I hope some investigative journalist out there can put all these pieces together!

***PERSONAL SPECULATION (take with a grain of salt):***

My personal theory is that much of the “UFO lore” we know today (EBE’s from Zeta Reticuli, the Alien exchange program, war with Aliens in underground bases, pretty much anything Tom Delonge has said that he was told by General McCasland) was created by the Air Force to make the subject seem crazy/laughable, in an attempt to cover up the very real crash recoveries and reverse engineering projects. It’s fascinating just how many of these stories can be traced back to the Air Force. I also think it’s possible some of the same AF generals involved with making these crazy disinformation campaigns were doing it to block further investigation into the subject, because they are the same extremely religious fundamentalist faction Elizondo and others have mentioned who try to block UFO research and believe the entities are [“demonic”](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/nab2mu/religious_zealots_within_dodusg) (possibly the ""[Collins Elite](https://spectralvision.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/ufology-and-the-collins-elite/)""?). I’ve tried to find information online regarding General Hennessey’s bio to see if he was similarly religiously affiliated as other AF generals involved with WPAFB and Air Force Materiel Command, but the only mentions of his life online I can find are military records. If anyone comes across more corroborating info, feel free to comment and I’ll add it to the post!",The Air Force General that oversaw Richard Doty later worked in senior management at Battelle

aliens,I would love to read them.,Has anyone here been abducted or had any strange encounters? Or have any family/close friends told you stories you believed?
aliens,,Subterranean Interview
aliens,"Suppose you are going to write something, you sense something and then find a suitable word to attach with it and you keep repeating this process each time with a different 'something' (all those directed towards the broad sense you want to construct) and finally you have a sentence ! 
So easy , right ? Yes, conversation is quite effortless and we almost never notice the depth of processes going inside just to create a sensible outcome. Well, that sensible outcome is sensible because we deemed it sensible (you know language , right ?) 
So, If I try to say it in simpler words, we are just converting those senses into sensible arrangement of words to make sense to others who will reverse it somehow and reach a different sense in their minds depending upon the words and their assumption. It is an imperfect transmission of data from one mind to others but it is sufficient enough somehow in maintaing a gross context of the conversation and if something goes wrong, we can always repeat it in a better way , change our words,etc. to make the person in front understand it.
Now, Lets take a deeper dive into this. Lets strip the verbal synthesis module out of our minds and then we have something undefined which has no boundaries , not limited to words , which can take any path of unlimited probablities... This  non-verbal part is pure consciousness.
It guides and controls every other processes and modules just like a pilot in a cockpit. 
This part is not simply a biological supercomputer ! This doesnt work on equations which we can define. And with quantum theory we learnt the observer effect on observation. That means if we observe some quantum process , it wave function would collapse and we somehow get altered results which we dont get we dont observe. 
So, This gives us a slight hint that somehow our observation which is an act of consciousness focussing on something , simply changes the outcome.
So, Our consciousness must have a quantum basis and when we tap into this realm, when the pilot starts observing himself, we enter into a state where we may manipulate outside world through a lot of quantum processes.

What do you guys think about it ?
And forgive me for my bad english.",What is consciousness ?
aliens,"I wanna talk about Travis Walton. His experience is super interesting to me. I used to help run a paranormal website and the owner did an interview with Travis. I’m amazed that after so many years, his story never changed and he seems so humble about the whole thing. 

Do believe him? Did anyone catch his episode on Joe Rogan?",Travis Walton
aliens,,So Steven Greenstreet (The Basement Office) has fully embraced the Mick West koolaid...
aliens,"To give some context, I was largely uninterested in the UFO/UAP phenomena until very recently. While I was interested in UFOs as a child, basically every UFO documentary I watched on TV basically amounted to “we have no hard evidence to suggest any of this exists, but maybe there’s something weird going on”. While I didn’t completely disbelieve the phenomena, there was really nothing verifiable there and the more I become educated on physics (at least our understanding of it) the more I became convinced interstellar space travel might be too difficult to pull off for ourselves or any other intelligent species, at least in our immediate part of the galaxy or universe. 

What compelled me to change my mind was Rogan’s interview with Commander David Fravor where he describes his experience in the Nimitz (tic-tac) encounter. Christopher Mellon, one of the few reputable public figures speaking about this IMO, has since stated the Nimitz encounter(s) as the most reputable publicly available information to verify the UFO/UAP phenomena. Multiple trained observers describe witnessing a craft that operated in a way that is completely different to any technology currently known to the public that was also picked up on multiple sensor systems. It apparently operated in a way that was completely foreign to any aircraft currently within our inventory or any adversarial nation’s inventory (especially in 2004 when this incident occurred), possibly operating via means of gravitational propulsion. Is it possible it’s our technology? Sure. But if it is I think it’s much more likely that it was reverse engineered from some craft that was developed by and retrieved from a non-human intelligence, as a scientific breakthrough of that scale being hidden from the public for presumably decades would be unprecedented in all of human history. Not a smoking gun for sure, but definitely something that makes you think “oh fuck this might be real”. 

So given this might be real, it “opens up the floodgates” so to say. What percentage of these encounters described throughout history might have actually happened, and could some of the encounters that have paranormal elements, or “high strangeness” also be real?  

After hearing Jacques Vallée, also on Rogan, I became convinced - or at least had a hunch - that there is some ability that these craft have to affect consciousness. It’s important to be skeptical of course, but I think Jacques and others have compiled enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that this phenomena is much stranger than the typical ""aliens from some far-away solar system"" hypothesis that most folks are familiar with. 

It seems like, whatever these craft/beings are, they are able to manipulate consciousness in a way that is completely foreign to our concepts of reality. I’m reminded of the quote from Arthur C. Clarke “*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*”. 

See: [Jacques Vallée’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e#Paranormal_research) work on the link between UFO’s and paranormal research. [This video](https://youtu.be/OyaNingLwkY) is a good introduction to him if you're unfamiliar. 

I think there’s a few possible explanations for this connection, including - but not limited to: 

1. These beings have some *technology* that has the ability to intentionally control our consciousness though some sort of prosaic explanation, like electromagnetic waves or some other conventional means of physics. Possibly a device or implant that would - for instance - allow them to communicate with us telepathically. 

2. These craft operate in ways that fundamentally perturb our consciousness, in the same way you can hold a magnet to an old-school CRT monitor and the screen would become [distorted](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/images/tv%20web%20DSC_2555.jpg). Not intentional per se, but it could have side effects on our experiences during these encounters nonetheless based purely on how they operate. 

3. There is something deep and fundamentally foreign to us about consciousness and how it operates. Not necessarily a technology in the conventional sense, but possibly that there are physics that can describe consciousness in very concrete terms in the same way we can describe things like gravity and other fundamental forces. This might allow us insight on how to manipulate it - maybe even through means we would consider ESP or psychic. This could either be something that may take thousands or even millions of years for any given intelligent species to comprehend, or something that our current understanding of science and the scientific method has kept us from discovering. 

4. We are living in a simulation, and these are beings or intelligences who exist outside of it in some sense and aren’t bound by the same physics applicable to us. Sort of like putting in a ""god"" mode cheat on a video game. Or possibly advanced ET or inter-dimensional beings who can essentially “see the Matrix code” and are able to “hack” the machine code of the universe. 

5. Similar to 4, except they are inter-dimensional but don’t abide by our laws of nature because of whatever endemic physics exists in the dimension they come from. 

There are other things that I've since opened my mind to based on certain anecdotes provided by figures in the community. Project Unity recently did a [podcast](https://youtu.be/OyaNingLwkY) with Matthew Roberts where he describes very strange synchronicities or coincidences after his experience of being on-board the aircraft carrier responsible for producing the GoFast and Gimbal videos while working as a cryptologist. He claims he felt as if the craft were there for some reason or another for him, and goes on to describe very bizarre events that started happening to him in the following years. He essentially describes events that might suggest that some entity or entities could be controlling aspects of his reality. Again, we need to take this information with a grain of salt, and it’s important we be both open-minded and skeptical about claims like this. 

The reason I bring it up however, is because Lue Elizondo recently mentioned in an interview that he also started to begin experiencing ""synchronicities"" after becoming involved in his work with UAPs (he’s a little vague but based on the context I think they’re describing similar experiences). He even mentions people who were already involved in UAP research told him this would happen. If what they’re describing is true, it seems like whatever these things may be they are basically able to curate human experience in ways that will - as stated above - seem like complete magic to us. 

Again, it's important we're skeptical here while also maintaining an open mind about this as members of this community. This phenomena exists on some spectrum with one end being completely benign explanations (e.g. swamp gas and weather balloons) and the other end being something so utterly bizarre it may take our civilization hundreds or thousands of years to fully grasp. In either case, it's important we consider all of the possibilities.",The link between UFO/UAP's and consciousness
aliens,"Yesterday I was reading a really interesting post on the thread either here or on r/ufos of a girl claiming the government doesn’t release the existence of ET’s because what happens to our soul/consciousnesses after we die. She claimed she had actually died with some weird story getting poisoned by El Chapo and experienced a higher for of consciousness after passing or something along those lines. I guess ET’s have something to do with this and also have the “answers to the universe.” 

It actually goes along with this post I saw on Instagram - https://instagram.com/p/CSANNGsJ09b/

Let now what you think, I thought it got most interesting around the middle when they discuss there might be competing factions in govt regarding disclosure and deals with aliens.",Reed Summers: the quiet invasion no one knows is happening (not Meridol)
aliens,"Hello all. I didn't become particularly interested in aliens until this happened, figured I would share my story. I don't know if what I encountered WAS extraterrestrial psychic aliens, some sort of spirit/angel, or just a product of my own, drug-fueled imagination. Other possibilities surely exist as well. This is just an account of what happened, as unbiased an account as I am able to provide.

Myself, my S/O, and our friend E, had been recently reintroduced to the idea that aliens may very well be here already, and suggested we join her on a trip to the UFO watchtower in Colorado. We are both open minded folks, and after hearing her story, we were intruiged. We have both agreed in the past that, on principle, we are surely not alone in the universe. Simply from a perspective of statistics, it would be silly to think that we are.

All 3 of us are also big fans of Ketamine. We do some k while working on a jigsaw puzzle as our friend E regales us with her experience. After a while she heads home. 

A few days later, another friend G comes over. G is already very much on that alien wavelength. We do some K with G and he gets very energized in the conversation, very passionate. He describes using his mind as an antenna in order to make contact, though the contact he found was not exactly the most friendly. It was more of ""HEY. WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR US?"" That echoed into his brain. He seemed unperturbed by it though - said they were probably just as surprised as he was. 

G leaves after a while. I start practicing leaving my mind open, skepticism to the side, as my S/O and I continue to do some K. As I step from the inside to our backyard, I feel a slight rush, and do a sharp inhalation. I continue talking, but my voice is altered.

This is where it gets weird. I have done K many times. Never before have I had this happen before. After my voice changes, I started talking to my S/O some more, but it's different. I'm no longer choosing the words coming out of my mouth. I'm not really the one talking, from what I can tell. The words being said are not particularly hostile or unusual, but for some reason, neither myself nor my S/O can remember what was said. The words WERE English from what I remember. But they were oddly scripted in a way. I can recall the conversation BEFORE as well as AFTER the voice had taken over. We walk back inside after what must have been 10 minutes or so. The voice leaves again once I step across the threshold. My S/O looks to me and asks ""Were you trying to make that voice?""

""...No, no I wasn't""

I have not been able to replicate the voice since. I am a vocalist, but the weird combination of high nasally sounds and weird, deep bass doesn't seem like something my voice should have been able to do. I can still recall HOW it sounded, as can my S/O, just not WHAT was said.

Immediately after the voice leaves though, it's like an idea was planted in my mind. I look to my S/O and say ""We have to do the Wim Hof Exercise."" With focus and intention, I dart across the room, grab my phone, plug wim hof exercise into google, and hit the first youtube video.

Prior to this, I had no idea who Wim Hof was, or what his accomplishments were. All I knew was that people had mentioned the Wim Hof method before in the ketamine subreddit. No other info aside from that was in my mind. We do the wim hof, and it was a hell of an experience. The exercise is essentially designed to oxygenate your blood and draw energy into your body, promoting wakefulness, boosting the immune system, etc.

However, every morning that I gather enough motivation to do this exercise, I manage to almost completely sidestep my sleeping disorder (Sleep Inertia). It was like a gift from a benevolent spirit, this little piece of information passed on to me. It came to me at a critical point in my life, when I was quitting cigarettes. It has helped me greatly ever since.

aliens,,Thoughts on this?
aliens,"It baffles me how people have not think this through and still have questions about why aliens have not been found yet till today, some even go to the extent to conclude that there are indeed no life other than us and that we are ""special"" and are an accident in physics. Though yes there are currently no evidence that proves if there are any life other than us and that we don't know for sure for the sake of being ""sure"", but i'm 99% positive that there are lives other than us- remember, there were once no evidence that there are other planets than earth.

Here's my theory on why we have not found ""alien"" yet. And no, it's not because they're hiding from us... lol.

People seem to have the idea if there is ""alien"" then they are 100% far much more advanced than us and can already manipulate reality by just a snap of their fingers and plus that they had already developed a technology that can travel much faster than the speed of light and that it'd take them a snap of a finger to travel into extreme distances such as lightyears... i have no idea where this theory comes from but i'm sure that the person who comes up with this idea is atleast a stoner. And also, even if there are such species with such capabilities, i have no idea why people seem to think that this ""earth"" stands out so much more than atleast thousands of other earths out there that it'd be impossible for them to ignore this ""earth"". In reality, we are just another speck of dust for them equally as any other goldilocks planets (planets with property for life) there are in this galaxy.

Here's my thoughts. It's very likely for life to exists somewhere out there in the universe outside of our planet before and after human and the earth itself even had existed and even presently. Life started because the condition in our planet is sustainable enough to support life, scientists have discovered atleast 4000 planets (which is called as goldilocks planet) that are confirmed to have the same sustaining properties earth has (similar to earth). I don't think that we're any special from them, if gravity applies to this planet then there would be no reason for gravity to not apply in other planet with the same property to conduct gravitational pull- i'm sure this also applies for life, if a planet contains all the necessary properties it needs for life- there's no reason for life to not occur just as how it occurs to earth.

The reason why we never met any aliens because the likelihood for any other intelligent interstellar species to be intelligent enough and had the capacity and machinary and that are willing to travel these incredible distances and somehow ended up on this one ""earth"" is incredibly unlikely.

For starter, it took earth 5 billion years to create an intelligent species that are intelligent enough to create machinary- which wouldn't happen if dinosaurs did not go extinct. Then it took us another 200000 years to gather knowledge to get to where we are right now.

Many other earths right now probably dont have an intelligent species yet that are intelligent enough to create machinary- or if there are, maybe right now the ""humans"" on those earths are still not advanced enough to be able to build a vehicle capable of lightspeed.

And even if they do actually have intelligent species capable of building vehicle with lightspeed, it'd take tonnes of resources and supplies just to reach their neighbouring stars. And don't forget- time... It'd take light few years to reach their closest relatives of stars and back, imagine if we are actually 200+ light years away from them... And if their vehicles aren't actually capable enough of lightspeed and still at the speed of half of lightspeed or even less... It'd literally going to take centuries... Are they even willing to set into this kind of journey ?  
That they'd sacrifice hundreds of years of their life (if they even live for that long) and are probably will never going to get to know their own home planet ever again. Imagine having to sacrifice hundreds of years of your life leaving everything you've ever known and love, just to meet ""earth""...

And despite of all of that, they don't even know if this ""earth"" still have life or not (yet)... What would make them willing to risk ? There are literally thousands of other earths out there that are most likely closer to them than us, why would you think they'd pick us rather than many other thousands of selection of earths ? What are the chance ? Imagine picking a number out of 1 to 1000 and then rolling a 1000-numbered dice to see if you got your number picked right...

aliens," In 1950, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked his colleagues at lunch, “Where is everybody?” His question became known as the Fermi Paradox. He wanted to know why we haven’t met any aliens if there are so many habitable planets in the universe.  
There are a lot of theories as to why we haven’t made contact yet (that we know of). But perhaps, we simply made a cosmic mistake in our calculations. We began by assuming that alien life would be like us. If that assumption is wrong, all of our calculations about finding alien life make no sense. So now we’re changing that assumption, broadening our thinking and our strategies to make contact with alien life that isn’t like us.

**10. The Sunset Of Radio Wave SETI**  
For over 50 years, SETI has been listening for radio signals from space. In 1974, astronomer Frank Drake sent the first radio wave message, the “Arecibo Message,” directed to aliens in outer space. As far as we know, we haven’t received an answer. Listening to NASA these days, you’d think that searching for alien life is their priority. Yet, Drake complains that NASA isn’t funding the search. In fact, they may dismantle our two biggest radio telescopes, the Arecibo telescope, and the Green Bank Telescope. If that happens, then SETI will be effectively shut down on the radio side. China has unveiled a complex radio telescope, although Drake isn’t sure if they can get the technology working correctly.  


On the other hand, optical SETI, which scans for laser flashes, is going strong from a funding standpoint due to private gifts. Unlike radio wave messages, optical messages depend on aliens targeting their narrow beams right at us. “The signals are so strong that we only need a small telescope to receive them,” said Drake. “Smaller telescopes can offer more observational time, and that is good because we need to search many stars for a chance of success.” Drake likes to think that if aliens are willing to target us, they may be altruistic.  


Not everyone shares his optimism. Experts are engaged in a heated debate about whether we should send messages into outer space at all. Many scientists believe we could be jeopardizing our safety by contacting aliens before we’re advanced enough to protect ourselves. According to John Elliott of SETI, there are members of the SETI community who are already sending messages despite the controversy. For the record, Drake is against actively sending signals to extraterrestrials, a project called active SETI. He prefers to simply listen for their signals.  


**9. Talking To Aliens 101**  
John Elliott of the UK SETI Research Network believes we should go beyond looking for alien signals and instead determine the difference between an alien language and random sounds. By studying more than 60 human languages, he found a common signature of rhythms and structures in each language. For example, we have content words and short function words (such as “if” and “but”) that bond phrases together. Regardless of the language, humans use nine content words at most in one phrase.  


Some animal species, like dolphins, have the same language signature. Although we can’t speak dolphin language yet, we recognize about 140 distinct sounds in their speech. They always identify themselves by an individual name or call sign when they begin to communicate, limiting themselves to no more than five words per content chunk. Elliott believes that limit is consistent with their smaller brain size and ability to process information.  


He’s developed a series of small computer programs, the Natural Language Learner, to analyze alien signals for the complexity and internal structure of language. However, he probably couldn’t decipher the content yet.  [Read more...](https://www.psychicloki.com/2020/05/10-ways-our-search-for-alien-life-is.html)",10 Ways Our Search For Alien Life Is Evolving

aliens,"So I just got done watching this movie called Contact. In this movie a girl visits another extra terrestrial planet and meets an alien but when she sees it, it looks like her dad. She knows it’s not her dad and she figures out the Alien downloaded her thoughts and made itself look like her dad so it was easier for her to comprehend and understand. What if that’s what all religion is based off. Now we all know a lot of religion is just made up story’s be radicals but what if that’s the premise of what caused these religions to grow so much, what if thousands of years ago aliens came to us but made themself look like our gods and fit what we believed in for us to understand better. Cause if you think about it people back then we’re just plain stupid. They had no education and they were all primitive. What if aliens did this so it was easier for us to understand them? And that’s what drove religions to become such a big deal with such a cult believing. Now obviously stories have been made up along the way of religion but what if this is the base of where all religions originally formed?

To realize after ever success or failure in your tragic or humorous life, doesn’t really matter. For this life is just for our “souls” (for lack of a better word) to do something. See in the future pain, greed, desire and death is gone. People might call it heaven. In a way it is, for when we die we leave our shell (body) behind and we are told we will then see past loved ones and friends. A place where there is no hate or wanting. However they left out the fact that you will grow bored.

That’s what heaven is. God/Allah/Deity is probably overseeing this Sim(city)ulation. Watch worlds be made and destroyed.

Never interacting with any of us.

That’s why I think it’s so funny that people think they are doing something positive or negative with love and hate. When in reality it doesn’t matter. Should try to love to make the simulation last.

103 years ago today three small children in Fatima Portugal claimed they received a message from ""a pretty lady"" who told them something would happen on the 13th of the next five months at the same spot, although it wasn't specific. 

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2017/08/ufo-hypothesis-far-more-credible-than.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2017/08/ufo-hypothesis-far-more-credible-than.html?fbclid=IwAR3OzBK5_OO_86uB2QYGl9_5vSoE1Q1_PKcSA21C31ZseBxtkElkiNmMHj0)

The youngest child came to the conclusion it was the Virgin Mary, even though the oldest, and most rational, one didn't initially agree, until pressured by many devout religious people.

Many of the exaggerated predictions never came true, but there was definitely a strange phenomena on each of the following five months with a growing number of witnesses each time, some some of the predictions did come true.

On numerous occasions there were things that we would interpret as UFOs today, especially on October 13th 1917 with the greatest crowds witnessing it and the strangest phenomena. 

They refer to this as the ""Miracle of the Sun"" but there's no way the sun could have entered the atmosphere without destroying the planet, especially since it wasn't observed more than fifty miles away.

A modern review indicates this is the largest UFO sighting in history.

It may be the strongest evidence of ties between UFOs and religion.

There's also evidence of strange weather phenomena, indicating that the advanced intelligence controlling this, whether you call it aliens, God or something else, may have the ability to partly influence the weather. This includes lightning on August the 13th, and much more bizarre weather on October the 13th.

This is a pseudo-skeptics nightmare, assuming people pay attention, since there's no way they can come up with a good explanation for it.

Hey guys, last night locals from a Rio de Janeiro County called Magé reported that a UFO has crashed into a lake near downtown.

The whole thing started around midnight when dozens of residents saw two brigth dots flying with a randomly speed...the object was being followed by another. These objects were sighted by residents in four towns of metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro.

Residents of Mage was shocked when the object started to descent at a high-speed as if ""it was falling from the sky"" after a few seconds they  heard the crash...

Not long after this it hit brazilian twitter  trendtopics and after that it started to show videos and witness account of the sight.

The buzz was, and still is, so huge that local tv news had no option but open some space for it .

Some of the residents are saying that the brazilian army has shut the ground zero and none of the residents were allowed to come near. The residents was waked up by five air force helicopters flying over ( what is highly uncommon ). Until now Army and the City council has avoid to talk about it but they claim that there's no sign of any accident in the area.

This happened not even in the last 24 hours the things is still going on here in Brazil... a lot of misinformation and each minute new information hit the internet about the event.

Why would they visit our planet? Most likely to study us and other life on the planet and I think some are there for reproduction or sinister experiments to create hybrids. 

I think it might be possible that they can communicate with people through dreams.

[Dolores Cannon on UFOs and ETs](https://youtu.be/1Rzbh2tRj_4) (her video explanation) 

Dolores Cannon Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique is a more advance past life regression  technique to go further down previous past lives incarnations then the standard model. For those who do no know, their abundance of research on people's going through past life memories. I'll leave some good links for the skeptics for how past life memories have existed for people: [Reincarnation Proof (News Report](https://youtu.be/2ESrd3mMop0)) , [Dr. Brian Weiss on the Patient Who Made Him Believe in Past Lives (Oprah)](https://youtu.be/WMlLoPYwZ5w), [Evidence of Reincarnation by Dr. Jim Tucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCHXMZH2aHA)

Dolores Cannon goes “down the rabbit hole” from existing reincarnation/past life research by developing a unique technique to go straight to the subconscious level. Here she has been able to access an individual's higher self, previous lives, and even higher beings that have been implanted into the subjects subconscious. Dolores clarifies three astonishing claims about Humanity and where it’s going (I personally find her explanations to be one the most grounded and intuitive explanations in regard to the ET phenomenon). To best summarize them:

1. **Humans  and our planet’s life was created by Extraterrestrial Beings** that  planted “the seeds of life” millions of years ago (and on other planets as well). Souls across the cosmos were sent here to try the Human Experience (living as a intelligent being with free will but whom have had their memories erased during incarnation). In other words, we are extraterrestrial beings who have are memories erased when we come to earth. Extraterrestrial beings (non-humans) were present during the Early stages of humanity, teaching us language and agriculture directly so we can jump start the Human experiment to see how we develop on our own after they leave. Dolores clarifies that the creation stories of the  oldest tribes and civilizations on our planet confirm this. Stories that tell of star people(Gods)/those from the sea helping out civilizations at its earliest stages.
2. **The  aftermath of World War 2 and the event of Nuclear weapons saw a increase concern of humanity's direction by Extraterrestrials.** The results were twofold: 1) More UFO sightings/encounters reports (especially  around New Mexico where nuclear weapons were tested-weapons that destroy humanity and the planet as they saw during WW2)  and 2) an indirect  approach to try to change the future of humanity by sending “new souls”  to Earth who did not have much life here on Earth before (This relates to reports of people having past lives on other planets based on  other past life regressions). These “new souls” (more pure in nature)  came in three waves. First wave was with a within a group of Baby boomers  (evident somewhat with the US hippie/protest movement in the 1960s  questioning the status quo), the second and third wave with a large  group of Millennials and Gen Z generation (evident with the rise of “New  age” thinking, questioning the establishment, and a return of psychic interests presently) 
3. **Changing Times?**: The hardest to grasp claim by Dolores is also the most important one too. The Extraterrestrials have the ability to see the possible futures because they are higher dimensions beings. They know about the dangers of humanity with nuclear weapons and climate catastrophe and are concerned about the Human experiment failing because that's where it's heading. They have created a backup plan to save certain people. This plan is as follows: Bring 'new pure souls' to the planet (the three waves mentioned before) to raise the frequency of other people and the planet as whole (almost as a awakening). Then (This is the hardest part to grasp) the planet will split between a Old Earth, stuck in the 3d dimension, and New Earth that will descent to a higher dimension. People with low energy frequency  (a lot of negativity in their lives/toxicity) will stay on the ""Old Earth"" because they haven't spiritually grown for learning what life is about.  People with high energy frequency (those with little karma and are a positive force) will move to a higher dimension on the New Earth. Dolores sights that  2012 (the end of the Mayan calendar) was the beginning of the acceleration process where more people (in absolute number) will become more spirituality awake/aware about life (become more positive/higher frequency) . She also states people with high/positive frequency will have their bodies/diet change to become more lighter to transition to the new dimension. I have also read reports that sleeping patterns, unexplained body pain, and subtle/periodic feelings of unexplained uneasiness will occur too. This New Earth transition will be a slow gradual feeling of change rather then a sudden one over months (you won't notice the change to transitioning from what I read/not entirely clear she states?). 

Dolores has been told that mediation and reducing negative karma in our lives (fears and toxic behaviors-be more good) will raise our frequency to be able transition to the New Earth. 

What makes me a somewhat believer has been my diet changes as I unexpectedly had to reduce my meat diet a lot from the past year since it has been harder to hold (even before I read about Dolores Cannon) I used to eat meat every day twice, now its only two-three times a week now. Overall my body has gone through drastic changes from the past year so it just makes me curious with this (I have been mediating since 2014 as a side note). 

Anyways,  Dolores says treat this as *Mind candy* at the very least and their is no harm in trying to be more of good person/less toxic and to adopt mediation into your life ([it has a lot benefits](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858)).  The more people raise their frequency (be positive) the more it spreads to others indirectly and helps others too. 

I find Dolores work to resonate well with me and glad to share with people why I think its interesting. Please check out her [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6tTHgyNTUCTauwkXI1aQvQ) to see more of her analysis, read her [books/reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/94865.Dolores_Cannon), an[d wiki page](https://nostradamus.fandom.com/wiki/Dolores_Cannon) if just want to skim over what she has said. 

Thanks for reading !",Dolores Cannon has one of the most interesting ET explanations I've found and I written summary of some of her main points to help people out with them
aliens,"I know this has been asked a few times, but I'm curious, what do you think their reasoning is? Assuming that they are visiting us, with their flight technology that has been witnessed I can only imagine that they wouldn't consider us or our technology much of a threat. 

I think it is fairly apparent that we are being, and have been visited for a very long time, yet they don't seem too bothered with staying out of view and hiding out of sight. They must be aware that we can see them in the sky, and that we are aware of their presence, especially at night with lights visible. Incidents like the Phoenix lights and the '52 D.C incident amongst many others contest to this. 

So assuming that there aren't any secret pacts, or secret contact between Govts and ETs (which I personally think is likely there isn't) what is stopping then from making contact? Could it just be that they think we are a violent species with no respect for our planet or the life on it and think they are best of just leaving us alone? Or maybe they have a non-interference law as we do when documenting nature and lesser species?

I would like to post a topic which doesn't let me go.

A lot of you already have seen the coming images, but i didn't find satisfying answers. So here we go.

In the antarctica you can see in Google Earth 3 interesting spots all ""near"" together.

You can just copy the coordinates and paste them to Google Earth/Maps

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Place One - The Ruins - 66°17'10""S 100°29'09""E**

[ruin top view](https://preview.redd.it/q9x44gxia7r61.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb1f5fa03b732c16fe92071626eb6c88e50933e)

Picture Date: 01.2012/02.2006

The first place I want to discuss is the ""ruin"" structures. It looks like the rest of foundation walls.The blue spots are clearly ice, so maybe the structures are completly of ice, although the structure is located near the rocks. On the 2006 Image you can see how the rocks shine through the ice. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjypYAIiwDQ&amp;t=118s) contains the structure and the conclusion is someone should go there and have a look :D.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Place Two - The UFO - 66°16'24""S 100°59'05""E**

[ufo top view](https://preview.redd.it/suvwy2doa7r61.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d56c29ba7cb8d8a581e8d1b56267d60ab2b6afa)

Picture Date: 02.2006

This looks like an ufo under an rock. After I measured it , this would assume that it itsn't round but maybe the perspective is tricking here. Some people told that this is ice, but then there wouldn't be the shadow around the object. Also here no satisfying explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Place Three - The Bunker - 66°36'12""S 99°43'11""E** 

[bunker top view](https://preview.redd.it/q00jea80c7r61.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ba19dc3d5696a03333826885bcb2b3f38a372)

Picture Date: 23.02.2006

This if for me by far the most interesting object. It really looks like a ""metal helmet"" with a cave entry.

Maybe the helmet structure is clear ice, but it looks like it is bumped round. Didn't find an explanation to this object which made sense.

&amp;#x200B;

**Distances**

ruins =&gt; 22,5 km =&gt; ufo =&gt; 49 km =&gt; bunker

&amp;#x200B;

**Nearest Station - 66°16'28""S 100°44'59""E**

You can find an old soviet union station on these coordinates. It is only a few kilometers away.

&amp;#x200B;

**What can we do?**

Every one has different opinions but what could we actually do? I tried to find satellite pictures of different years, but the best I could find are these ones and the older ones are so blurry that you can't see anything. These images are  9 to15 years old. If it is only ""ice"" like most people mentioned then the riddle would be instantly solved with new satellite pictures. So we need better pictures. I found a website where you can buy images with the best satellite available for the public. One shot costs around \~570$ for one image. So my suggestion is we collect 1710 $ and get some new images to finally get answers or someone of you can get newer/older images for free. Every helpful tip is appreciated.

aliens,"I really don’t know if this thread is the appropriate place to post this but it does seem somehow related. Yesterday while video recording my wife on her IPhone 12 I noticed some tiny flashes of light on the screen . I thought this must be some defect with the phone or reflected light from something When we actually sat down and watched the video frame by frame we discovered tiny points of light circulating around the room which seemed to speed up or slow down depending on her “ state of emotion “ It was astounding.They changed direction and some of them were so fast that they appeared as just a streak of light . One actually started on the far side of her then arced over her head in a circular fashion then dipped behind me .Absolutely not in keeping with the linear physical properties of light.  My wife was in disbelieve . As a scientist I felt that we must reproduce this phenomenon in an experiment.Other than the light from the phone illuminating her the room was pitch black . I took my I phone 10 and tried recording. Nothing appeared  I used her IPhone 12 ,turned off the lights and recorded and again they appeared . She was just laying beside me on the bed with her head under the covers at the time I recorded with her phone, frightened to pieces . The points of light were larger and slower and less excited if you will . I proceeded to record the ensuite and walk-in closet in the dark without her present . Nothing . She reluctantly agreed to enter these rooms . Again they appeared travelling  randomly but again much slower and larger . When I showed  her the video she became very upset and would not allow me to continue this experiment. Today while I was in the bedroom, she called me from the laundry room and told me that she felt something in then laundry room light began to flicker . I saw the light flickering as I approached the door but when I entered the light ceased acting strangely. I asked for her phone and immediately started to record with the laundry room lights still on . I was astounded to find that the points of light appeared on the phone again and they seem to be circulating in the room again much smaller and moving much more quickly. My wife as a child suffered horrible abuse at the hands of a priest between the ages of 5 and 10 .I had no idea this was the case during our first 18 years of marriage. She had never told a single soul.In 2013 she revealed to me what had happened. after her mother had died, who was devout Catholic.She kept this to herself all of those years because she didn’t want to destroy her mother’s  faith in the church. After seeing the video of the lights in the laundry room she stated to me “ So I’m not crazy.” She told me that as a child she had seen simulate phenomenal which she had reported multiple times to her parents and spend many nights sleeping in their bed. Her mother would always check the room and reassure her that there was nothing there.Het parents sent her  to have her eyes checked. She saw them at home she saw them in Scotland where  her family was. She saw them on the plane to Scotland outside of the window causing a considerable ruckus when  a British soccer team present on the plane all ran over to her side of the plane to look out the window to see what was there. Nobody  saw anything. She was told by her uncle in Scotland that she was experiencing “an optical illusion“ the poor thing grew up as a child saying that she had “ obstacle illusions”  She had never mentioned these to me until today. She told me that her mother had convinced her that these were her “ Guardian Angels” As she grew  older she simply thought that she was “crazy “ as a child. She still saw them and felt them but would not share this with anyone for fear she would be labeled the same as an adult.The video recordings convinced her to share this with me today . I ran through my head the different possibilities including some sort of micro organisms that appeared in the light of the iPhone12 or some type of light reflections however neither of these explanations make any kind of sense The light does not behave in a physical manner of a light wave and if they are some sort of micro organism why have they followed her and only her around her entire life from her childhood and why do they increase in their velocity and randomness when she becomes upset or excited.I did a Google search (which really is inadequate) which revealed many reports of this iPhone being dysfunctional but mostly with flashing screens or starting and stopping mysteriously in the middle of the night which can be explained by disfunction of the phone itself .I went downstairs and told our housekeeper who is a devout Filipino Catholic I thought  what I had seen and of course the first thing she said was “ well that’s a light reflection.” When I showed her the videos her face dropped she crossed her self and said these are her “Guardian Angels“ when I tried to explain to her that she knew that I did not believe in God per se and  that I had a profound distain for any type of organized (or unorganized religion for that matter) , she spoke to me sternly and said” these are “Guardian Angels ”I don’t want to see any more videos and I don’t want to talk about this anymore. For me they are Guardian  Angels.I do not know what these are but I am quite certain they are not Angels. I will research this to the extent that I can. I am literally afraid to post these videos for fear that she and I would be labelled “loonies”by society or otherwise would attract undue attention from government agencies. The other issue is that I’m afraid that any attention drawn to my wife after everything that she has gone through would not be healthy for her. Having said that, she is willing to have this examined by “experts“. For the life of me I really don’t know where to turn to these . Who are the experts here? I certainly would not trust Apple . I found a website on the Internet from the United States government where one can report” Alien  encounters “ That frightens the hell out of me. For now I am keeping these videos until I discovered the appropriate venue to release them. If anyone has any suggestions I would really be grateful .

aliens,"I shared a story from a book a read about a week ago; The Lady of Fatima.  Where 70,000 people apparently experienced, something...  A lot of people enjoyed the thread.  It also became clear to me that there are a lot of people here who only have a passing interest, who haven't taken the time to read any of the books on The Phenomenon.  

So I thought I'd share another absurd story which I had read; where it's clear SOMETHING did happen.  

In contrast to the people who had never heard the Lady of Fatima story, there were also people who DID know a lot about it.  People who brought a lot more discussion and resources to the conversation.  I'm hoping that happens again, as on this story I only know what I've read from this book and some brief follow up research.  

**This event was also interpreted by the people who experienced it as religious experience, and I can see why.  
However if you look at it from a UFO perspective a lot of details line up with things that are quite common across many various UFO encounters.**     

This is not my own research or writing, I'm simply copying the **text from ""American Cosmic"" by D.W. Pasulka**.  In hopes to promote discussion on the events.  Perhaps generate interest in the book for those who like to read.  I personally do not know how much of this I can really believe, but none the less it's interesting and there is evidence of SOME event taking place.

&gt;It was very early on a Sunday morning in March of 2012.  
Rey and Dulce’s beloved Niña, a Jack Russell terrier who had been a member of their family for sixteen years, had become paralyzed the night before. Rey had contacted a veterinarian friend, who said that Niña had most probably suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. The friend offered to open his office the following day, Sunday, to euthanize Niña. Deeply saddened, Dulce turned to her faith. She prayed to God that he would send his angels to cure Niña. That morning, her prayers were answered, in a way that would shatter Rey’s atheism and confirm Dulce’s faith. Rey, in an interview, relates the first of a series of extraordinary experiences, and figure 6.1 is a depiction of what Rey saw. Rey’s wife saw something like figure 6.2.  

Depictions of what Rey and his wife saw;

**Here again is a case where different people are experiencing some sort of event, but they not exactly experiencing the same thing...**    

&gt;*My wife woke up and [checked on] the dog to see if she had regained her mobility. Our pet was not able to move at all except just from the neck up. My wife then carried her down the stairs, and when she got down there she saw an object that was floating four feet off the ground, one foot [away from] the wall, and it was metallic in shape—approximately like an upsidedown-U. . . . It had these two ring lights in the center. My wife, being the good hardcore Catholic from Mexico that she is, she knelt down and started praying . . . basically [saying,] “If you’re a bad spirit, leave. But if you are a good spirit or an angel or the Virgin Mary [stay].” Mexicans always see the Virgin Mary everywhere [Rey laughs]. And she said, “Please stay and don’t let my dog suffer. My poor Niña.” Niña is her name, which means “little girl” in Spanish.  Then all of a sudden these green lights started blinking and started flashing on her—like scanning her. At that point she freaked out and she started yelling for me. She started screaming my name. It was six in the morning, and I thought she had seen a cockroach or a little mouse on the floor [Rey laughs]. I  just totally ignored her. After 10 or 15 minutes of screaming for me to come downstairs, she went upstairs and literally hauled me out of bed. When I got downstairs, what I saw was not the object that she had seen. . . . What I  saw was, I  guess could be described as a plasma-object. This was not just an object; I call it a plasma-being, a light being, because it did control my mind. It was . . . approximately two-to-three-feet in width, one and a half to two feet in height, cylindrical in shape, but it didn’t have any external outer edges because it was pure energy plasma. Multicolored, translucent, and when I looked at it I did not have any peripheral vision . . . just straight ahead at that object.  I could not see to my right or to the left or up and down. . . .  I was just focused only on that object. What I did was quite irrational—I  stared at it, I  waved my hand at it, and then I  said, “Ah B.S.”  .  .  .  Then I  turned around, I  walked upstairs, I went to my bed, I folded my hands on my belly, and I looked straight up at the ceiling. So for 15 minutes I was in this hypnotic state with nothing entering my brain/my consciousness. After 15 minutes, it was [as] if the hypnotist said, “OK Kid, wake up, we’re finished with your wife and your pet.” And all of a sudden I woke up and I said, “Oh my god, what in the world just happened?” I ran downstairs and there was my wife jumping up and down, saying “Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The angels cured her! The angels cured her!” She was running around the living room dancing, and the dog was running up and down with the energy of a little puppy. Right there my whole worldview was totally shattered [Rey laughs].*  

-  

&gt;Dulce said that she had not seen what Rey reported seeing. He insisted that he had been asleep for forty-five minutes after he left the living room. He pointed at the clock to demonstrate that forty-five minutes had indeed elapsed.  Dulce insisted that she never left the living room and that Rey had never gone back upstairs. According to her, she had walked downstairs with Rey behind, looked down, saw Niña running around, and then started to celebrate. Then she saw Rey. Their recollections of the event were completely different. Later, Rey would incorporate the idea that “missing time” must have been a factor in the event, and that the nonhuman beings had taken his wife and dog, healed them, and then returned them.  

As you can see, Rey is a logical man just as he proclaims to be.  Yet the events which occurred;  

&gt;""*This event shattered Rey’s view of reality. At the time, he said, he was a “pure rationalist”*""    

-  

&gt;*My wife does not want to speak much about the incident and acts like nothing of consequence happened—to her this entity was merely an Angel that had answered her prayers. Maybe she is correct. Our living room corner wall is on the northwestern corner of our house. At 6 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner. We have closed drapes on the western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the southeastern side. We also have a wall dividing the windows from the sun rising in the east from this western corner. We know what we saw was not an optical illusion.*  

-  

&gt;*I went to Catholic mass but just to comfort my wife. I  had never read any UFO, ancient alien, paranormal or “new age” books. I  believed that all the new age “metaphysics” literature was pure BS from ex-hippies even though I  considered myself an ex-hippie while living in Berkeley, CA, from 1981 to 1988 while attending a PhD Program in City and Regional Planning. I was a total skeptic. I was a pure rationalist and any “metaphysic” or UFO related themes were pure BS. On that day, my world view came crashing down.*  

-  

&gt;After this experience, Rey did what most experiencers do:  he sought out materials to help him understand what had happened to him. He had never had any type of paranormal experience and certainly never encountered an “energy plasma being.” He wasn’t Catholic like his wife, so he wasn’t sure it was an angel, although he wasn’t ruling out that possibility either. He thought that he could find answers in the UFO and paranormal literature. Perhaps what they had encountered was some type of nonhuman intelligence.  He looked for answers on the internet and ordered “tons” of books about the topic. His intensive “book encounter” was interrupted, however, by more strange and anomalous events.  

They both began to have more encounters, with witnesses along side them to verify the veracity of the observations.  

&gt;The next event occurred in May of 2012, when Dulce reportedly saw a huge, blimp-sized UFO outside their house with “stained glass windows just like our church” all around the craft. When Dulce later visited Mexico, she claimed to have had a series of additional UFO sightings, some with her family, and saw three eight-foot-tall human-looking beings dressed in white monks’ robes floating in front of her.  Rey had his own sightings. The next event provided Rey with more information about the phenomenon and further changed his life and its direction. It was also witnessed by his daughter, he said, and three of his friends. By this time, his wife was having regular sightings of giant UFOs. For her, these were angels and evidence of sacred contacts. She did not tell Rey about these encounters at the time, because she was becoming concerned about his increasingly obsessive interest in UFOs and literature about them.  

-  

&gt;On August 25, 2012, a few months after the appearance of the “plasma energy being,” a friend of the family came by for help with some traffic tickets. Rey decided to wait for him outside. It was around 9:30 p.m. The sky was dark and cloudy and completely devoid of stars. Rey had been learning about UFOs and knew that some people attempt to “call them down.” Rey thought, I am going to try this, so he did. Fifteen minutes went by and there were no results. Rey thought to himself, I am freaking losing it; I am going nuts, and he stopped. Just at that moment, he saw an enormous
object over his neighbor’s roof and backyard.  Rey describes the object as huge, approximately two to three city blocks in length. It was hovering about five feet above his neighbor’s house. He saw hundreds of swirling white lights all around it. Then he heard the voice of his daughter, even though she was not present.  The voice said, “Daddy, next time you see a UFO please let me know. You
and mommy have seen a UFO and I want to see one too.”  After this, Rey called for his daughter, who was in the house.  His daughter, who had just turned ten years old, ran out to see the object, and stared in amazement.  

-  

&gt;Rey and his daughter gazed at the object for about fifteen minutes, he said, and then his friend drove up with his wife and seventeen-year-old daughter. These people are conservative Catholics and college educated. Like Rey’s wife, hey attend Sunday Mass and are involved in many different ministries. They weren’t interested in anything that had to do with the paranormal, or with UFOs. When they arrived on the scene, Ray says, they were flabbergasted. **“What is that?” his friend asked, alarmed. According to Rey, they asked repeatedly, “Please tell us what that is.” Finally Rey spoke to them in Spanish: “You know perfectly well what that is.”**  As the speculations of his friends became more elaborate, he decided to try to communicate with the beings, mentally.  He told them, “You better come up with something better than this because they don’t believe you.” Instantaneously, he said, the light patterns of the craft changed.  The craft burst into a spectacular display of hundreds of stars, ten times the size of Venus, that flickered on and off.  

**""The Phenomenon negates itself**""  Jacques Vallee.  

Again, a common theme in UFO encounters is that despite the significance of the event you may not want to document it in any way, despite your thoughts before it happened.  

&gt;**It was the odd reactions of the other experiencers that most struck Rey as unbelievable**:  

-  

&gt;During our UFO contact encounter, I was fully cognizant and “awake” for almost everything except the realization that we were actually looking and interacting with a UFO craft and its beings. We all had cell phones and yet no one even bothered to take a picture, especially the teenager who always has a cell phone glued to her hands. I also did not notify my neighbor to inform them what was above their house. They were aware of us looking at them because they had turned the light on in their living room and they saw us staring at their house. I also did not run inside to get my video camera or tell my wife. After my daughter told me that there were no mosquitoes outside, I “woke up” and realized that I was under some type of “mind control.” I could not understand why I had walked away from a scenario that should have been the front page story of Time magazine and every media outlet around the world if I  had captured it on video. I quickly got my camera and camcorder and ran outside with both but the huge UFO craft was gone.","“What is that?” his friend asked, alarmed.

aliens,"   Humans need to be vibrationally compatible with the “ aliens “ or higher beings BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL ACTUALLY COME. We are not ready for them to show up and stay because too many things have to drastically change in our global society before that could happen. 

    If “ they” were to show up, it would be more of a danger to us than to them. Someone (forgot his name sorry) once asked this question, “ Would you land a helicopter in an insane asylum full of armed patients?” That’s basically what it would be like if they were to arrive. 

    We aren’t vibrationally ready for them. This is where it gets confusing to me. The “ elites” or whatever you want to call them have been lowering our vibrations for centuries using wars, famine, toxic food, toxic water, toxic programming and even toxic MUSIC (check the frequency most modern music operates on). 

   The “ elites “ know that we are not ready because 
they have been in constant communication with these beings through channeling. This isn’t very far fetched because even your average Joe can contact these beings through channeling, meditating and raising vibrations.
   
   My thing is, why would they want to lower our frequency ? Don’t they want these being to show up and stay? Lowering our frequency just slows down the process and seems counterintuitive. 

  Unless the Georgia Guidestones are real and they actually want the population under 500,000 in complete harmony with nature... I don’t see the “ aliens “ showing up any time soon.",We are not ready for them to show up and stay because too many things have to drastically change in our global society before that could happen.

They got off earth and went somewhere else. Our ansestors were left behind on earth, they were essentially like the tribes in the Amazon. So they got left. With that said let’s talk about how time is relative, time for a twin brother on earth would go much much faster than the other twin on Pluto right. So allow me to assume this civilization that got off earth, made home near some incredibly dense celestial body. their timeline would move faster and after Being so much more advanced than us already, technologically grew by an order of magnitude. What we think are aliens are actually just a breakaway civilization of humans coming back to view our progress. They do their best to not make contact and influence us, just as we show the same kind of malevolent curiosity to tribes deep in the Amazon.",So here’s my thought.. if you tested the dna of an alien the difference in DNA would be no more different than a chihuahua compared to a Great Dane.

aliens,"Hello all! I'm new to this subreddit, and I came here because I had to share my strange experience. 

This happened a couple weeks ago, and I'm honestly still trying to process as I'm not completely sure what happened or what it was that I saw. I apologize that I can't give concrete dates, since I work nights and my days tend to blur together.

It must've been the last week of July. It was my first of two days off, and I'd spent most of the day relaxing. My father was working that day, and he gets home around 11:20pm. Every night, my dad and I will smoke a couple joints together (we live in Canada, where cannabis is legal) and I had spent a few minutes before he got home rolling our first joint for the night. Then I went outside, put the joint in the ashtray, and lit a cigarette. My dad pulled into the driveway a couple minutes later. I asked him how work was, small talk and all that, then asked if we could smoke the joint outside since it was such a nice night out. There were some light clouds, but the stars were all still clearly visible (we live in the boonies, so there isn't much light pollution) and he agreed. So he went inside to get changed and make a drink, and he came back out with his BluTooth speaker and phone. He put on some music, and I lit up the joint.

We chatted for a while, smoking, leaning against the railing of the front porch. I was looking at my phone when my dad slapped my shoulder, pointed to sky, and asked ""Do you see that?"" I followed where he was pointing, and saw two stars between a break in the trees across the road. I was about to ask ""What?"" when I noticed it. One of the stars seemed to be moving, ever minutely. While the one star looked normal (that slightly orange white colour), the other had a red organs hue to it. It would moved the tiniest bit in one direction, then another, up and down, left and right, then it would stop and seemed to quiver in place before moving again. Sometimes it seemed to flare with a brighter light, then dim down again, and it almost looked like it was illuminating the thin clouds around it. Thinking maybe it could be a trick of the eye (just below where the ""star"" was, there were electrical cables) so I moved to sit down in a chair where the cable weren't as close to the ""star"". It didn't change anything. The star continued to move erratically, flare then dim again. 

We say outside until well after midnight, watching it. It never moved much, staying in the relatively same area of sky, like it was moving but very far away. Something in my gut told me what I was seeing wasn't normal.

Then, a few days later, after my dad got off of work we decided to have a fire while we smoked a joint outside again. That night was cloudless. At the back of the house this time, on the patio, we saw the same thing. A tiny pinprick of light moving erratically, flaring with light then dimming again.

I don't really know what I saw, but I had to share.",I Saw Something a Couple Weeks Ago...

aliens,"This is my theory. We used to, as a ""species"" have advanced technology, similar to the capabilities of what we have today. The reason for this? Depictions of Ancient Texts citing ""Flying Chariots that rain fire from above"". 

The Vedas (Ancient Indian Religous Texts) point out noble Gods who fight off wicked forces, flying craft called Vimanas, and … nuclear war? Are we sure these were just allegories?

Funny enough, it is not known to many that Hitler had developed a huge interest in Sanskrit Vedic Scriptures, as he believed they held the Knowledge of the enormous power of mankind. So much so that he actually reached out to an Indian scholar before WW2. 

Now... here's where it gets interesting. Imagine if something catastrophic happened. Something that leaves less than 5% of the world's population alive and destroys all of their technology (yes I understand, you might question that there would be evidence, something along the lines of fossils... yadayada) but if you take into the account that we might have had weapons that were capable of vaporization - what would be left behind?

How would you try and preserve the knowledge of what you knew and had access to? You would etch them into stone - kind of full circle. Started off as a ""species"", drawing what we could on the walls of caves to then trying to preserve what knowledge/experience/stories we had on walls...but for who? For the future. More specifically for the people of the future. So that their past is not forgotten. It is part of human nature to leave ""our legacies"" behind.

Think about this. We all have specialized jobs. You might be able to turn a TV on and off - but would you EVER be able to actually build one from scratch? 

But since this thread is about aliens. Let's loop them back into play. It might be true that Aliens had actually given us technology, or perhaps even conceived us ""in their own image"". Looking at Indian Gods and Goddesses, there are quite a few interesting depictions - they are not all the same. A few of them are blue, a couple of them have multiple arms. 

But this is where the rabbit hole starts... Ganesh, who in Indian Mythology, is very revered, actually had his head chopped off by his father (story goes along the lines of his father not being able to recognize his son once he comes home from War). In order to save his son, he goes into the forest and gets the head of the first thing he sees - in this case an Elephant. Now, you might think this is outrageous... but hold on, wouldn't futuristic civilizations able to able to perform operations as such? In today's world, decapitation of someone's head probably means they are instantly dead, yet he was able to revive his son. 

Now I will talk about Krishna - who is depicted as being Blue in most/if not all images. People don't realize that his colour had CHANGED as he ingested poison from a river to save others. Sounds like a mutation doesn't it? Gods can have their genes mutated? 

We forget that Gods don't last forever. They can be killed. Look at Norse Mythology. Although it is currently plagued by pop-culture; Thor and The World Serpent have always been destined to kill each other - it's a never ending cycle. The end of the world has already come, and is yet it arrive.

Similarly, this is what has been happening to us. We have been through the motions, having civilizations that were wiped out, only to restart and forget who we were and what we were previously capable of. It is why we have Ancient Monuments that we can't explain till this day.

I believe in reincarnation. But not of the soul. Of Humanity. We will continue to fail, until we break the shackles of our mind. Ultimately, Failure is the biggest teacher. What if this whole time. It was just US.

I would like to support the theory that radiation from the bomb announced our presence much more prominently than SETI radios. It wouldn't make much sense for an advanced civilisation to use radio signals that even we don't primarily rely on.

There is also the radioactive aspect of the objects. In plenty of investigations carried about by the military into witnesses claims, they often look for radioactivity around spots the objects allegedly landed on. It's heavily correlated.

If aliens did exist right to the point where we can actually tell that they are out there living like us, why would we know? I mean, theres nothing about space or anything of the sorts that doesn’t go through the government or is controlled by the government. And i truely dont believe the government would tell us, i mean why would they, until 20/30 years ago people were still panicked by the thought of aliens, people were disgusted by it as day to day people, it was just absurd and so far fetched. So why would the government even tell people, i know too many regular people that would get panicked by the thoughts of aliens, but maybe thats why now we the government are releasing more information.

Either that or aliens dont exist i think, because we have already said that we can pickup any signals almost that alien life would give off, maybe in the mid 1900s when we developed tech to be able to pickup or see traces of manmade objects, thats when we communicated with others but the government hid it, makes more sense that telling the world back in the 1950s when people were still on average insanely religious, and basic technology of 2020 would have still been shocking to some people back in the 1950s.

These are attributes that were shown to us and to which we now have access. Your free will depends upon the knowledge you have of your own power. Your happiness depends upon the love that you give and receive.

Like all conscious races at this stage of progress, you may feel isolated on your planet. This impression makes you sure of your destiny. Yet, you are at the brink of big upheavals that only a minority is aware of.

It is not our responsibility to modify your future without you choosing it. Consider this message as a worldwide referendum! And your answer as a ballot!

Who are we ?

Neither your scientists nor your religious representatives speak unanimously about the unexplained celestial events that mankind has witnessed for thousands of years. To know the truth, one must face it without the filter of one´s beliefs, however respectable they may be.

A growing number of anonymous researchers of yours are exploring new knowledge paths and are getting very close to reality. Today, your civilisation is flooded with an ocean of information of which only a tiny part, the less upsetting one, is notably diffused.

What in your history seemed ridiculous or improbable has often become possible, then realised, in particular in the last fifty years. Be aware that the future will be even more surprising. You will discover the worst as well as the best.

Like billions others in this galaxy, we are conscious creatures that some name ""extra-terrestrials"", even though reality is subtler.

There is no fundamental difference between you and us, save for the experience of certain stages of evolution. Like in any other organised structure, hierarchy exists in our internal relationships. Ours is based upon the wisdom of several races. It is with the approval of this hierarchy that we turn to you.

Like most of you, we are in the quest of the Supreme Being. Therefore we are not gods or lesser gods but virtually your equals in the Cosmic Brotherhood.

Physically, we are somewhat different from you but for most of us humanoid-shaped.

Our existence is a reality but the majority of you does not perceive it yet. We are not mere observations, we are consciences just like you. You fail to apprehend us because we remain invisible to your senses and measure instruments most of the time.

We wish to fill this void at this moment in your history. We made this collective decision but this is not enough. We need yours. Through this message, you become the decision-makers ! You personally.

We have no human representative on Earth who could guide your decision.

Why aren´t we visible ?

At certain stages of evolution, cosmic ""humanities” discover new forms of science beyond the apparent control of matter. Structured dematerialisation and materialisation are part of them. This is what your humanity has reached in a few laboratories, in close collaboration with other ""extra-terrestrial"" creatures at the cost of hazardous compromises that remain purposedly hidden from you by some of your representatives.

Apart from the aerial or spatial objects or phenomena known about by your scientific community, that you call ´UFOs, there are essentially multidimensional manufactured spaceships that apply these capacities.

Many human beings have been in visual, auditory, tactile or psychic contact with such ships, some of which are under occult powers that ""govern"" you. The scarcity of your observations is due to the outstanding advantages provided by the dematerialised state of these ships.

By not witnessing them by yourself, you cannot believe in their existence. We fully understand this.

The majority of these observations are made on an individual basis so as to touch the soul and not to modify any organised system. This is deliberate from the races that surround you but for very different reasons and results.

For negative multidimensional beings that play a part in the exercise of power in the shadow of human oligarchy, discretion is motivated by their will to keep their existence and seizure unknown.

For us, discretion is motivated by the respect of the human free will that people can exercise to manage their own affairs so that they can reach technical and spiritual maturity on their own. Humankind´s entrance into the family of galactic civilisations is greatly expected.

We can appear in broad daylight and help you attain this union. We haven´t done it so far, as too few of you have genuinely desired it, because of ignorance, indifference or fear, and because the emergency of the situation did not justify it. Many of those who study our appearances count the lights in the night without lighting the way. Often they think in terms of objects when it is all about conscious beings.

Who are you ?

You are the offspring of many traditions that throughout time have been mutually enriched by each others´ contributions. The same applies to the races at the surface of the Earth. Your goal is to unite in the respect of these roots to accomplish a common project. The appearance of your cultures seems to keep you separated because you substitute it to your deeper being. Shape is now more important than the essence of your subtle nature. For the powers in place, this prevalence of the shape constitutes the ramparts against any form of jeopardy.

You are being called on to overcome shape while still respecting it for its richness and beauty. Understanding the conscience of shape makes us love men in their diversity. Peace does not mean not making war, it consists in becoming what you are in reality: a same Fraternity.

To understand this, the number of solutions within your reach are decreasing. One of them consists in contact with another race that would reflect the image of what you are in reality.

What is your situation ?

Except for rare occasions, our interventions always had very little incidence on your capacity to make collective and individual decisions about your own future. This is motivated by our knowledge of your deep psychological mechanisms.

We reached the conclusion that freedom is built every day as a being becomes aware of himself and of his environment, getting progressively rid of constraints and inertias, whatever they may be. Despite the numerous, brave and willing human consciences, those inertias are artificially maintained for the profit of a growing centralising power.

Until recently, mankind lived a satisfying control of its decisions. But it is losing more and more the control of its own fate because of the growing use of advanced technologies, which lethal consequences on the earthly and human ecosystems become irreversible. You are slowly but surely losing your extraordinary capacity to make life desirable. Your resilience will artificially decrease, independently of your own will. Such technologies exist that affect your body as well as your mind. Such plans are on their way.

This can change as long as you keep this creative power in you, even if it cohabits with the dark intentions of your potential lords. This is the reason why we remain invisible. This individual power is doomed to vanish should a collective reaction of great magnitude not happen. The period to come is that of rupture, whichever it may be.

But should you wait for the last moment to find solutions ? Should you anticipate or undergo pain ?

Your history has never ceased to be marked by encounters between peoples who had to discover one another in conditions that were often conflictual. Conquests almost always happened to the detriment of others. Earth has now become a village where everyone knows everyone else but still conflicts persist and threats of all kinds get worse in duration and intensity.

Although a Human being as an individual, yet having many potential capacities, cannot exercise them with dignity. This is the case for the biggest majority of you for reasons that are essentially geopolitical.

There are several billion of you. The education of your children and your living conditions, as well as the conditions of numerous animals and much plant life are nevertheless under the thumb of a small number of your political, financial, military and religious representatives.

Your thoughts and beliefs are modelled after partisan interests to turn you into slaves while at the same time giving you the feeling that you are in total control of your destiny, which in essence is the reality.

But there is a long way between a wish and a fact when the true rules of the game at hand are unknown. This time, you are not the conqueror. Biasing information is a millenary strategy for human beings. Inducting thoughts, emotions or organisms that do not belong to you via ad hoc technologies is an even older strategy.

Wonderful opportunities of progress stand close to big subdual and destruction threats. These dangers and opportunities exist now. However, you can only perceive what is being shown to you. The end of natural resources is programmed whereas no long-term collective project has been launched.

Ecosystem exhaustion mechanisms have exceeded irreversible limits. The scarcity of resources and their unfair distribution - resources which entry price will rise day after day - will bring about fratricide fights at a large scale, but also at the very heart of your cities and countrysides.

Hatred grows bigger but so does love. That is what keeps you confident in your ability to find solutions. But the critical mass is insufficient and a sabotage work is cleverly being carried out.

Human behaviours, formed from past habits and trainings, have such an inertia that this perspective leads you to a dead end. You entrust these problems to representatives, whose conscience of common well-being slowly fades away in front of corporatist interests, with those difficulties. They are always debating on the form but rarely on the content.

Just at the moment of action, delays will accumulate to the point when you have to submit rather than choose. This is the reason why, more than ever in your history, your decisions of today will directly and significantly impact your survival of tomorrow.

What event could radically modify this inertia that is typical of any civilisation ? Where will a collective and unifying awareness come from, that will stop this blind rushing ahead ?

Tribes, populations and human nations have always encountered and interacted with one another. Faced with the threats weighing upon the human family, it is perhaps time that a greater interaction occurred.

A great roller wave is on the verge of emerging. It mixes very positive but also very negative aspects.

Who are the ""third party"" ?

There are two ways to establish a cosmic contact with another civilisation: via its standing representatives or directly with individuals without distinction. The first way entails fights of interests, the second way brings awareness.

The first way was chosen by a group of races motivated by keeping mankind in slavery, thereby controlling Earth resources, the gene pool and human emotional energy.

The second way was chosen by a group of races allied with the cause of the Spirit of service. We have, at our end, subscribed to this disinterested cause and introduced ourselves a few years ago to representatives of the human power who refused our outstretched hand on the pretext of incompatible interests with their strategic vision.

(Editor's Note: This makes them sound like the good extraterrestrials who are reported to have met with U.S. President Eisenhower, and offered to teach us about spirituality. They were, of course, rejected. Eisenhower then met with some negative extraterrestrials, the grays, who did offer all kinds of military ""goodies"". According to Phil Schneider (God rest his soul. Thank you for giving your life for us):

In 1954, under the Eisenhower administration, the federal government decided to circumvent the Constitution of the United States and form a treaty with alien entities. It was called the 1954 Greada Treaty, which basically made the agreement that the aliens involved could take a few cows and test their implanting techniques on a few human beings, but that they had to give details about the people involved. Slowly, the aliens altered the bargain until they decided they wouldn't abide by it at all.

That is why today individuals are to make this choice by themselves without any representative interfering. What we proposed in the past to those whom we believed were in a capacity to contribute to your happiness, we propose it now to ... you!

Most of you ignore that non-human creatures took part in the exercise of those centralising powers without them being neither suspected nor accessible to your senses. This is so true that they have almost very subtly taken control. They do not necessarily stand on your material plan, and that is precisely what could make them extremely efficient and frightening in the near future. However, be aware that a large number of your representatives are fighting this danger ! Be aware that not all abductions are made against you. It is difficult to recognize the truth !

How could you under such conditions exercise your free will when it is so much manipulated ? What are you really free of ?

Peace and reunification of your peoples would be a first step toward the harmony with civilisations other than yours.

That is precisely what those who manipulate you behind the scenes want to avoid at all cost because, by dividing, they reign! They also reign over those who govern you. Their strength comes from their capacity to distillate mistrust and fear into you. This considerably harms your very cosmic nature.

This message would be of no interest if these manipulators´ tutorate did not reach its peak and if their misleading and murderous plans did not materialise in a few years from now. Their deadlines are close and mankind will undergo unprecedented torments for the next ten cycles.

To defend yourselves against this aggression that bare's no face, you need at least to have enough information that leads to the solution.

As is also the case with humans, resistance exists amongst those dominant races. Here again, appearance will not be enough to tell the dominator from the ally. At your current state of psychism, it is extremely difficult for you to distinguish between them. In addition to your intuition, training will be necessary when the time has come.

Being aware of the priceless value of free will, we are inviting you to an alternative.

What can we offer ?

We can offer you a more holistic vision of the universe and of life, constructive interactions, the experience of fair and fraternal relationships, liberating technical knowledge, eradiction of suffering, controlled exercise of individual powers, the access to new forms of energy and, finally, a better comprehension of consciousness.

We cannot help you overcome your individual and collective fears, or bring you laws that you would not have chosen, work on your own selves, individual and collective effort to build the world you desire, the spirit of quest to new skies.

What would we receive ?

Should you decide that such a contact takes place, we would rejoice over the safeguarding of fraternal equilibrium in this region of the universe, fruitful diplomatic exchanges, and the intense Joy of knowing that you are united to accomplish what you are capable of. The feeling of Joy is strongly sought in the universe for its energy is divine.

What is the question we ask you ?

""DO YOU WISH THAT WE SHOW UP ?""

How can you answer this question ?

The truth of soul can be read by telepathy.

You only need to clearly ask yourself this question and give your answer as clearly, on your own or in a group, as you wish.

Being in the heart of a city or in the middle of a desert does not impact the efficiency of your answer, YES or NO, IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASKING THE QUESTION! Just do it as if you were speaking to yourself but thinking about the message.

This is a universal question and these mere few words, put in their context, have a powerful meaning. You should not let hesitation in the way. This is why you should calmly think about it, in all conscience.

In order to perfectly associate your answer with the question, it is recommended that you answer right after another reading of this message.

Do not rush to answer. Breathe and let all the power of your own free will penetrate you. Be proud of what you are ! The problems that you may have weaken you. Forget about them for a few minutes to be yourselves. Feel the force that springs up in you. You are in control of yourselves !

A single thought, a single answer can drastically change your near future, in one way as in another.

Your individual decision of asking in your inner self that we show up on your material plan and in broad daylight is precious and essential to us.

Even though you can choose the way that best suits you, rituals are essentially useless. A sincere request made with your heart and your own will will always be perceived by those of us whom it is sent to.

In your own private polling booth of your secret will, you will determine the future.

What is the lever effect ?

This decision should be made by the greatest number among you, even though it might seem like a minority. It is recommended to spread this message, in all envisageable fashions, in as many languages as possible, to those around you, whether or not they seem receptive to this new vision of the future.

Do it using a humorous tone or derision if that can help you. You can even openly and publicly make fun of it, if it makes you feel more comfortable but do not be indifferent for at least you will have exercised your free will.

Forget about the false prophets and the beliefs that have been transmitted to you about us. This request is one of the most intimate that can be asked to you.

Making a decision by yourself, as an individual, is your right as well as your responsibility !

Passivity only leads to the absence of freedom. Similarly, indecision is never efficient. If you really want to cling to your beliefs, which is something that we understand, then say NO. If you do not know what to choose, do not say YES because of mere curiosity. This is not a show, this is real daily life, WE ARE ALIVE ! And living !

Your history has plenty of episodes when determined men and women were able to influence the thread of events in spite of their small number.

Just like a small number is enough to take temporal power on Earth and influence the future of the majority, a small number of you can radically change your fate as an answer to the impotence in face of so much inertia and hurdles ! You can ease the mankind´s birth to Brotherhood.

One of your thinkers once said: “Give me a hand-hold and I´ll raise the Earth"".

Spreading this message will then be the hand-hold to strengthen, we will be the light-years long lever, you will be the craftsmen to ... raise the Earth as a consequence of our appearance.

What would be the consequences of a positive decision ?

For us, the immediate consequence of a collective favourable decision would be the materialisation of many ships, in your sky and on Earth.

For you, the direct effect would be the rapid abandoning of many certitudes and beliefs.

A simple conclusive visual contact would have huge repercussions on your future. Much knowledge would be modified forever. The organisation of your societies would be deeply upheaved for ever, in all fields of activity. Power would become individual because you would see for yourself that we are living. Concretely, you would change the scale of your values !

The most important thing for us is that humankind would form a single family in front of this ""unknown"" we would represent !

Danger would slowly melt away from your homes because you would indirectly force the undesirable ones, those we name the ""third party"", to show up and vanish. You would all bear the same name and share the same roots: Mankind!

Later on, peaceful and respectful exchanges would be thus possible if such is your wish. For now, he who is hungry cannot smile, he who is fearful cannot welcome us. We are sad to see men, women and children suffering to such a degree in their flesh and in their hearts when they bear such an inner light.

This light can be your future. Our relationships could be progressive.

Several stages of several years or decades would occur: demonstrative appearance of our ships, physical appearance beside human beings, collaboration in your technical and spiritual evolution, discovery of parts of the galaxy.

Every time, new choices would be offered to you. You would then decide by yourself to cross new stages if you think it necessary to your external and inner well-being. No interference would be decided upon unilaterally. We would leave as soon as you would collectively wish that we do.

Depending upon the speed to spread the message across the world, several weeks, or even several months will be necessary before our ""great appearance"", if such is the decision made by the majority of those who will have used their capacity to choose, and if this message receives the necessary support.

The main difference between your daily prayers to entities of a strictly spiritual nature and your current decision is extremely simple :

we are technically equipped to materialise!

Why such a historical dilemma ?

We know that ""foreigners"" are considered as enemies as long as they embody the ""unknown"". In a first stage, the emotion that our appearance will generate will strengthen your relationships on a worldwide scale.

How could you know whether our arrival is the consequence of your collective choice ? For the simple reason that we would have otherwise been already there for a long time at your level of existence ! If we are not there yet, it is because you have not made such a decision explicitly.

Some among you might think that we would make you believe in a deliberate choice of yours so as to legitimate our arrival, though this would not be true. What interest would we have to openly offer you what you haven´t got any access to yet, for the benefit of the greatest number of you ?

How could you be certain that this is not yet another subtle manoeuvre of the ""third party"" to better enslave you ? Because one always more efficiently fights something that is identified than the contrary. Isn´t the terrorism that corrodes you a blatant example ?

Whatever, you are the sole judge in your own heart and soul ! Whatever your choice, it would be respectable and respected ! In the absence of human representatives who could potentially seduce you into error, you ignore everything about us, as well as from those who manipulate you without your consent.

In your situation, the precautionary principle that consists in not trying to discover us does no longer prevail. You are already in the Pandora´s box that the ""third party"" has created around you. Whatever your decision may be you will have to get out of it.

In the face of such a dilemma, one ignorance against another, you need to ask your intuition. Do you want to see us with your own eyes, or simply believe what your thinkers say ? That is the real question!

After thousands of years, one day, this choice was going to be inevitable: choosing between two unknowns.

Why spread such a message among yourselves ?

Translate and spread this message widely. This action will affect your future in an irreversible and historical way at the scale of milleniums, otherwise, it will postpone a new opportunity to choose to several years later, at least one generation, if it can survive.

Not choosing, stands for undergoing other people´s choice. Not informing others stands for running the risk of obtaining a result that is contrary to one´s expectations. Remaining indifferent means giving up one´s free will.

It is all about your future. It is all about your evolution.

It is possible that this invitation does not receive your collective assent and that, because of a lack of information, it will be disregarded. Nevertheless no individual desire goes unheeded in the universe.

Imagine our arrival tomorrow. Thousands of ships. A unique cultural shock in today´s mankind´s history. It will then be too late to regret about not making a choice and spreading the message because this discovery will be irreversible. We do insist that you do not rush into it, but do think about it ! And decide !

The big medias will not be necessarely interested in spreading this message. It is therefore your task, as an anonymous yet an extraordinary thinking and loving being, to transmit it.

You are still the architects of your own fate...

aliens,"Hi everyone. So some background. I am a 23 year old female who grew up in a small Canadian village my whole life. There has always been some odd things here.

I would like you help in explaining what this is. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Below is a list of occurrences. 

1. 3 dancing lights 

This is the most common. Before the sun sets three stars will appear in the  in a triangle formation. They will last for about 10-20 minutes. The stay still for 1/3 of the time and it’s easy to mistake them as stars. But then for the remainder of the time they start erratically chasing each other all over the sky. Then the fade out one by one. Multiple people in my village has seen this multiple times.

2. Northern lights? 

One day my family saw what looked to be the northern lights. But we are not nearly north enough and it only covered a small part of the sky. It was very shimmery and seemed to sparkle. It was above a neighbours house. That same night my grandmother reported a strange metal round plane flew over her house. No ones has seen this again.

3. Circle of fire 

My grandmothers neighbours heard strange noises one night (not uncommon since the entire village is surrounded in dense woods so much wildlife). They next morning they found in their back lawn the grass had been burnt in a perfect circle. Nothing around it seemed effected but the ground was blacked. 

4. Shadow figures 

Every kid I knew experienced this in their house. At night you would see shadow figures walking around. As children you thought this was normal until an adult questioned it. It was not concerning because you just somehow knew that these figures were not malicious. Some children claimed if they saw one at night and you had lit candles they would all go out at once.

So yeah that’s everything I can think of for now. If anyone has any similar experiences or scientific answers that would be a big help! It’s just now bothering me ever since I moved to Toronto and don’t experience any of this anymore.

aliens,"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" this is true. However, I see this phrase abused by self proclaimed rationalists alot. 

They use it as a way to dismiss any possible good leads. For example the infamous three videos from the Pentagon got discredited by some youtubers by merely looking at the footage. 

Not only are they assuming that they know better than trained professionals, they're only looking at a fraction of the data. The video is only surface level to radar readings. Speed, IR, shape scanners along with an entire team solely dedicated to the maintenance of the devices and reliable eye witnesses. If they're really confident in their video analysis they should consider applying to their jobs. 

Sure this pile still isn't as strong as seeing it in person but dismissing it solely on that basis isn't fair yet. What we should look for here instead is possibility. 

The more reasonable position is to admit that it's unexplainable, hold back any belief or disbelief and use the available information to **find** the extraordinary evidence

Dr Michio Kaku acknowledged this and is taking the more grey approach to the UFO topic. I hope he can clear up the misconceptions about us all being crazy.

Now that we have some information on the shape, size, speed, and frequency. It should be easier to identify/verify a sighting's legitimacy the next time around. 
For example it's possible to filter out the usual cgi work by getting specific. 

Little by little a map could be made and perhaps some hints on areas of activity which could ultimately reveal their intentions. Human or not.",Extraordinary evidence won't land on your doorstep

After the first go around we felt the air get colder and it felt like we were in almost a different dimension things were different but again tripping off shrooms ! So we get to the open field almost and I see a light in the sky that starts off as pin point very small and is getting closer to us coming right in our general direction so I ask her if she sees she says yes she does , it’s coming in fast as hell and it slows down and I can see a few lights at the bottom then takes off again . It was too fast to be a plane or helicopter and it was able to go fast and slow up .... after that we joked about being already on the ship and then my friend trips and it sounds like mental clanking on a metal floor.... we were on pavement and there was nothing there for her to trip on .... she said she felt an object too and WE BOTH HEARD THE SAME SOUND .... it was really crazy everything just felt different after that and I woke up with a scratch and bruise idk how to post pictures on here tho .

I feel bad for people who take him seriously.  Corbell, Knapp, DeLonge and others are just easy marks for him.  You don’t have to be an FBI profiler to see how uncomfortable this guy gets whenever he has to give detail or any sort of “anchoring” statements.  Doesn’t mention managers he had there, what types of specific scientific tools or equipment he worked with, the facilities where he lived, food he ate, specific months or dates, didn’t describe paperwork in great detail that he submitted or read based on his work.  Really didn’t talk about jack shit or what he actually did there day to day.  I even thought that his bland descriptions of the craft itself were pretty exposing for someone is supposed to be a respected and intelligent scientist.

Rogan actually asked some probing questions by accident a couple times and you could see how uncomfortable he got with “migraines” or forgetting stuff due to memory.

A lot of our history includes wars with other countries, there was a surge in UFO sightings or UAP after the atomic bomb was dropped and this never stopped. One of the incidents I find most interesting to date was reported by former Air Force Captain Robert Salas, a UFO appeared over Malmstrom Air base in 1967 where Salas was stationed overseeing 10 nuclear missiles. He reported that the missiles suddenly became inoperative. Similar phenomena has been reported with UFOs being the common denominator that isn't just 1 case but I wanted to throw one in.

So we have the atomic bomb, in 1962 the US detonated a 1.4 megaton nuke high in the atmosphere maybe at this point we're really starting to peak interest from neighbouring civilisations who have the means technologically to investigate. Then there's the incident I gave example to above where our missiles were disarmed in the presence of a UFO. It just seems as though they seem to have an interest in our weapons, the most recent articles we've all read even mentioned senator Rubio of the senate select committee of intelligence said he is primary concerned over the UFOs around american military bases. There's some more military cases I'd like to add but then this will turn into a huge essay looking page so I'll stop here.

Assuming the 1967 incident is a true story maybe this was a way of indirectly trying to communicate with us to stray away from that kind of technology. I don't think they're concerned that we pose a danger to them since the common theme for UFO sightings is they defy physics as we know it and perform feats that outmatch any earth made vehicle but I think we're being watched closely to see how we'll develop. 

What are your thoughts? If you've got different theories like you think we're being observed for a different reason or something feel free to share.",Do you think humans are being observed as hostile species?
aliens,"I don’t know if this has been theorised before but I just wanted to put it out there, please tell me your thoughts and correct anything that I have wrong because I don’t know all the necessary science.

My theory is that there are other alien civilisations out there, as advanced or slightly more advanced. But they are light years away. 

And because a light year is how far light travels in one year and our sight relies on the light to show us what’s happening. (if a star is 40 light years away we’re not seeing it now we’re looking in our present and seeing the star as it was 40 years ago.) then the civilisations would see us in the past. 

Civilisations could be up to or over 2000 lightyears away and therefore would see us in the ancient times as hunter-gatherers or a very small civilisation compared to what we have today, rather than a space-travelling race like we are slowly progressing towards. And we would see them the same way. 

I don’t know this for fact, and correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure our telescopes aren’t good enough to see the surface of a planet that far away, and therefore the lack of lights or satellites or similar would be how we saw if they were a advanced civilisation, but maybe they are there now, we’re just seeing them before they advanced that far.",My idea of why extra terrestrial civilisations have not been discovered or why we haven’t been discovered by extra terrestrial civilisations.
aliens,"The UK has a .gov website in which you are able to see released documents from the government. In the link provided there are UFO files where people state what they saw( sighting reports)

it goes from 1997 -2009

after 2009 it goes silent and there is no more reports.

there was an official request made for release of the UFO sightings within the last 75 years but it was rejected because apparently the UK space agency doesn't own it's own documents anymore? can someone help to explain whats going on here?

aliens,"People who believe in aliens are often ridiculed and considered as 'crazy' or 'funny'. Yet, if you believe in God then most people have absolutely no problem about it. The universe is unimaginably huge - just in the observable universe there are billions of galaxies, full of billions of stars and planets. There is absolutely nothing insane in believing in the intelligent life in the universe - just probability and the evolution. In fact, many top scientists think there must be intelligent life out there.

Meanwhile, the more we know about universe and physics, the more and more people stop believing in God (top scientists from physics rarely believe in God). I'm not saying that God doesn't exist - I have no problem if someone believes in God. I'm just saying that believing in physical beings from other planet is AT LEAST as reasonable as believing in the omnipotent invisible supernatural God. In my opinion it's much more reasonable, but it's definitely not less reasonable.

I would go a step further - if I believe that aliens actually visit and observe us, then I shouldn't be considered more 'crazy' than somebody who prays, who makes some religious rituals and who is convinced that God listens to his prayers from the sky and helps him in every day life guiding him on Earth. It annoys me when believing in God is 'accepted behaviour' yet believing in ETs is considered foolish and crazy.",It's absurd that believing in aliens is considered more crazy than believing in God

""Human Manifesto to the One's Descendant""

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tell me son. Who is stronger, you or me?

&amp;#x200B;

 With 20 years old and half his life being an active and healthy boy his son replies: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I would be lying if Id tell you're stronger than me father. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Correct, thats why I put you in this meat cocoon that is your body. I needed someone stronger than me to carry on a part of myself onto the tomorrow I wont see. Someone to tell about me after I die.

&amp;#x200B;

 A mutual sentiment of awkwardness and dire was shared between one and one's descendant. The private yet shared emotion of the imminent end that comes with the incarnation of a biological body.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Yes son, Death is all around us. Is our food, our drink, is the air we breathe and is our ultimate destiny. But you shall never forget: What comes after leaving our body, is not different from what was before. No time, no matter, only shared consciousness. Pure existence: Everything and nothing. We are God, being itself. But in order to taste, to see, hear and feel you need atoms, and cells, to come up in the most efficient way to organize to build eyes, tongues and fingers. Youre matter incarnated by God son. Youre consciousness playing with matter and energy. Look across the universe and you will see rocks and fire, clouds and ice, but matter and energy finding the smartest way to organize itself and change what is around it, and to thrive and carry on. Well that is the most magical thing you could see among the stars. 

&amp;#x200B;

   And thus my son, Life is magic, consciousness is divinity, we are swimming through a river of matter and energy towards the sea of omni-presence. Thats why it doesnt matter if one believes it or not. If we were designed by a God, or if we are God itself. It doesnt matter because its already happening, we rose from all life and now rule this planet, and we already have the power to destroy this Earth my son. Our survival, the survival of all known life, is up to us to decide. 

&amp;#x200B;

   I must tell you the principles that carried me here, to this poor and isolated place of society, the principles that secure life survival and thus go directly against the profitariat way of all the human herd: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- HUMANS MUST LOWER THEIR ECO-IMPACT

&amp;#x200B;

  Ecological Impact is the nature of all living things, and having 0% Eco-Impact means to literally not exist. But 100% means to have destroyed everything. Our civilization needs to reach levels around 15%-20% Eco-Impact, while currently is at around 35%. And 45% means extinction or war. Individuals must grow some of their food, learn to recycle water, learn to build and use energy. This can be teach in any school. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- WE ARE TOO MANY 

  

   Principal problem of humanity as the ruling civilization on this living planet, is that we are too many. A third of land is destined to human sustain, water is abundant but drinkable water is scarce, some profit makers are already trying to capitalize on this resource on global scale. Being too many is the problem that will be addressed the sooner, either the herd is notified or not. Disease or war, it was never so easy to place it exactly where you need it. The powerful are the most dangerous son, be careful. But yet, being too many is the one problem that can be fixed the quickest and in the most peaceful way. By restricting our capabilities to leave descendants, by giving those who give their fertility away a sustain for life. And by caring well for those who are born as they will make the next generation. Here is the third point my son: You

&amp;#x200B;

\- DESCENDANTS MUST BE THE OBJECTIVE OF HUMANITY

&amp;#x200B;

  Bureaucracy infected every inch of the gears that make our system son. In the time something that needs to be done gets done, two or three decades have passed. People dying of old age vote for policies that they wont experience, and perpetuate issues in their generation and the one before. Descendants must to be awakened of the divine power of humans, they must understand all life is in our hands and the ones controlling the fingers are squishing it away. We need our sons and daughters to realize survival, not only human, needs to be addressed and taken seriously. These descendants will wield the power of consciousness from a young age, tested in real life scenarios to search and find their best fit into society. To shape the human world from the ground up. These descendants will be given high ranking positions in the political structure of the human society.

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Father... Most of us are irrelevant. You fight against the means for power, the profit mainly, but yet its the profit that fuels the human machine. How can I steer the wheel if the right to do it is bought? 

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Son, this is why we might be doomed, this is why the herd might be slaughtered again and again but kept carrying the carriage of the wolves. This is the scary part, the violent and primitive. The fourth point is: We are still animals.

&amp;#x200B;

\- HUMANS ARE ANIMALS. THUS MUST OBEY THE LIMITS THAT COME WITH IT

&amp;#x200B;

   I started talking to you on how our bodies are a mean to a goal, how our physical self is not who we are, but it is what we are. Yet, this is why everything is relevant. What the body receives the soul experiences. Death at a global scale means to make the planet experience life squishing away. It is happening, and we are doing this to ourselves and most of other life forms out there. Making most of humans realize this, trying to reduce the need for them to do this and finding the lowest impact procedure to take it into action, will mean to find balance between life and death and start wielding our divine power with responsibility.

aliens,"Hey all I’m new to this sub.
I wanted to see if anyone else here has had a similar experience as me and two former classmates. Or maybe an explanation of what it could’ve been. 

When I was a kid I went camping with family/friends and one night when I was coming out of a camper I saw what looks like the cone shape that a flashlight makes when you turn it on in the dark, it was light blue and very wide. It turned for maybe 10 seconds and it looked as if there was a giant flashlight in the sky searching a close by field. It looked way to big to be from a helicopter, plus no flying vehicle could be seen or heard. And I was even more shook when some adults with me said they saw it too.

Last year in two different conversations two classmates told me of similar experiences. 
Mine was in CT, one was in Long Island, and I think the other in Kentucky. And they were years apart.

aliens,"If we are already being visited, these beings surely have the technology and capacity to show themselves to the masses by landing in a big city such as New York, London, etc.


&amp;nbsp;


Some of my theories of why they would not do that are:  
1. They do no want to interfere with our development.  
2. We are being experimented on and observed and they do not want to affect the results similar to how a scientist would not want to affect an experiment’s control group.  
3. They have made an agreement with our government to not do so in exchange for something which, may or may not be related to my second theory.  
4. They live here and do not want to affect their habitat and way of life which, could happen if the public knew about them.

aliens,"Here are the my opinions about aliens I wish to post. Feel free to comment.

1.Aliens don't exist or will never contact us

The scientific explanation and the most probable according to me.

2. Religious explanation

I am Eastern Orthodox Christian and very faithful. I haven't yet read the Bible,but I will attempt with Internet. What strengthens my faith the most is the fact that He indeed helps me commonly enough to prove that it is not random,but also the fact that I have recently read some biblical divinations on the Internet that proved to be true. It is possible that Christianity,some  other religion or even many of (certainly at least some are fancy jokes) the faiths have aliens intervening,altrough that is not the way I usually think.

3. Just one scenario of the claimed ones (these that think the same are counted as a single)

It is possible,but somewhat unlikely in  compared to the next one.

4. More than one claimed scenario is true (not nesecarrily all since at least some could be lying here)

It is very possible that there could be many true scenarios (of ones that are antonymes of each other at least one is false,unless there is some very weird thing out there)about aliens.

I haven't ever seen any aliens and don't know what to say,altrough even that may not be true. Recently I have seen some shades moving from the other side of the door that looked somewhat like a being with a large head. Never found them.Probably were just an illusion,but I don't know....

aliens,"This has been on my mind for a while now and i believe that aliens are using our planet as a way to spy on their enemies and study other galaxies. Now listen, these aliens could be from the near middle of our galaxy where it is too bright and full of radiation or their planets have a terrible atmosphere for them to do any study on space, plus our small planet at the edge of the galaxy we get a perfect view of other galaxies and solar systems, yes they could send out their own space cameras but they might get destroyed by the radiation in our galaxy, we have only began to scratch the surface of our galaxy with our own satellites. It is also very rare that other aliens could travel from galaxy to galaxy as it would take millions of years so that's why I am focused on the ones in this galaxy. There could be a war going on in our galaxy which is why they are doing a study on us and watching the military as a just incase they attack us, and also they wont include us in their reason for being here cause they want to keep the peace and it's also not our war, yet anyways.",Aliens are using our planet to spy/study other solar systems

aliens,"Mankind is a Disease of the Universe' There, now you know the truth. You must make it known throughout the world. If people on Earth want us to give them the benefit of our experience and help them gain millions years of scientific knowledge, they have to show us that they want to meets, and above all demonstrate that they deserve it, and that all this cane done without any danger to us.

If we give our knowledge to humanity, we have to be sure they will make good use of it. Our observations in recent years have not shown that wisdom rules the Earth. Certainly there has been progress, but some people still die of hunger, and a warlike spirit still exists throughout the world. We know that our arrival could improve many things and unite nations, but we have to feel that people really want to see us, and that they are truly starting to unify.

We also have to feel that they really want to see us arrive, knowing fully who we are and understanding the true meaning of our arrival. Several times human warplanes have tried to chase our crafts, taking us for enemies. You must tell them who we are, so that we can show ourselves without any risk of either getting hurt or killed - which is not the case at present - or of creating a dangerous and murderous panic.

Some researchers want to contact us by radio, but we do not respond because in this way they could locate our planet. On the other hand, transmission times would be too long, and our broadcasting system uses waves that your technology cannot pick up because you have not yet discovered them. They are seven times faster than radio waves, and we are experimenting with new waves that are one and a half times faster than that.

Progress continues, and our own research continues for the purpose of understanding and relating to the large being of whom we are a part, and on whose atoms we are parasites. These atoms are the planets and the stars. In fact, we have been able to discover that intelligent living beings in the infinitely small live on particles that are planets and suns to them.

They ask the same questions as ourselves. Humanity is a disease inside this gigantic being, and the planets and stars are its atoms. Also this same gigantic being is in its turn a parasite on other greater atoms. In both directions, it is infinite. But the important thing is to make sure that the disease, which is humanity, continues to exist and never dies.

We did not know when we were creating you that we were accomplishing a secondary mission “written” into us, thus repeating what had been done for us. From what we created and how it has developed, we have discovered our own origins. For we were also created by other people who have since disappeared. Their world has quite certainly disintegrated, but thanks to them, we were able to continue in their steps and create you.

We may disappear one day, but by then you will have replaced us and taken over our roles. So you are the link in the precious chain of human continuity. Other worlds exist, and humanity is certainly developing in other parts of the universe. But in this region of the universe, our world is the only one to have made new creations. This is important because, from each world, innumerable children can be brought forth who are precious for preserving continuity. This allows us to hope that one day humanity will no longer be in danger of disappearing completely. But we are not sure that humankind can ever stabilize itself in abundance.

The chain has always continued, but we must not upset the equilibrium of the immense body in which we are a parasite because, by developing too much, we could trigger a catastrophe, which at best might bring about a recession and at worst cause complete destruction. In a healthy body, a few germs can live without danger, but if they develop too much, they cause a disease, which troubles the organism. Then the organism reacts to destroy the germs responsible, either naturally or with the help of medication.

The important thing is to create enough worlds so that humanity does not extinguish itself, but above all else, to make sure that the equilibriums not broken by concentrating our efforts anew on seeking to make those who exist happier. It is in this area that we can help you tremendously.’","The Greys are messengers, (what we call ""angels""). Here is their message to humans."

aliens,"Came across this website while looking up possible fracking sites near Puerto Rico. 

I would love to read some opinions and thoughts about the claims being made here.   

&gt;[As for the specific case of the south-eastern sea region, there is a significant evidence of this (which we published in our book 'El Yunque: Gateway to Other Worlds') which is shown in an official NASA document, a video filmed by the astronauts crew of the space shuttle mission STS-80, when they filmed  a UFO that flew out from the sea at a point located south-east of the island-municipality of Vieques, after which it soared out into space at a speed of 500 miles per second. After approaching the space shuttle the UFO suddenly swerved to the left and quickly disappeared into deep space. 

The specialist in digital imaging analysis, and consultant to NASA, Mark Carlotto, studied this video's data, the specific day and time and azimuth position the STS-80 shuttle was at when taking the views, and undoubtedly confirmed that the UFO rose out to space precisely from a point at sea south of the island of Vieques, precisely at the point in which lies one of the structural anomalies we discovered, the large quadrangular-shaped structure. ](http://jorgemartin-enigmasdelmilenio-english.blogspot.com/2012/08/did-we-discover-large-undersea-alien.html?m=1)

Another possibility is that the vast complex of underground / underwater structures located in the south-east of Puerto Rico is extremely old and was built prior to modern humans living in this area. 

Its origin could be dated to a period during or before the last ice age, as huge ice sheets covered much of the Earth in those days, and the sea level worldwide was much lower than it is today. 
As a matter of fact, it is known that for some time the islands of the Greater Antilles were one single mass of land that wa above the sea level of that past era. Perhaps a highly developed protohistoric civilization now dissapeared from the face of Earth could be responsible for the construction of these surprising structures. 

But there is another possible explanation: what if the structures were not the product of human technology, nor the product of an antediluvian disappeared human civilization, but the product of a civilization of aliens who have lived in this area for a long time, hiding from humanity?&gt;",Aliens in/near Puerto Rico

aliens,"I am posting my story in a few different places, in hopes of finding some answers! 


I have always had trouble with night terrors as a child. Around the age of 14-15 I started having a reoccurring dream/night terror where I was laying in bed and the wall beside me would crumble and become a huge hole that I would crawl through that led to the middle of a road I had never seen before with houses on either side of me. In this dream I would slowly walk down the road and take in all the details, such as specific house numbers, gardens, yard decorations etc. As soon as I reached a specific house, blue Christmas lights would turn on and trigger me to automatically turn around to look behind me and realize I'm being followed by a ""monster"" (which I have come to call and alien as I've learned more about my situation)
The ""monster""/alien would begin to chase me as soon as I noticed its presence. In some dreams it would catch me and I'd wake up screaming(those were the dreams where I actually confronted the monster). In other dreams, I would successfully get away but wake up breathing heavy as if I was actually running away.

So here's the glitch. About 6 years ago, my (then) boyfriend (now husband) and I went on vacation to a beach called Cherry Grove in South Carolina. We were arguing and decided to take a walk to discuss our problems. The argument was heated so neither of us were paying attention to where our walk led us, but we ended up sitting on this bank with our feet dangling above marshland. As the argument died down and the sun set, I began tracking what I thought was a giant crab below us, ready to shine my flashlight on it as soon as it got close enough. But, the closer it got the bigger it got and I realized it definitely was not a crab and I definitely did not want to see what it actually was. It crawled almost directly below us and reached up with an arm that looked like a scythe (sort of like the Pokémon Scyther!) and I tried to discretely stand up and suggest we walk back to the beach house without freaking my husband out. I noticed he was staring off in the distance and said he saw something huge walking out of the marshes onto land and I told him about the creature that reached up for my leg and we booked it back to the road to get to our beach house. As we were walking back I realize how familiar everything around me is and I start listing off details of the houses around us before we reach them, which really freaked my husband out considering he just saw a ""monster""...
It takes me until the blue Christmas lights turn on to realize we were walking on the actual physical street that my dream takes place. I told my husband not to turn around and to just keep walking as if we didn't realize where we were. We got back to the beach house without being hurt, but I will always regret not turning around to meet my monster/alien face to face.",My alien dream became a reality!

Anything that comes here is coming here for profit, power, control, and/or territory, not to teach ""primitive earthlings"" how to effect a better existence.  


We can look to any colonial/profiteering endeavour where people have travelled vast distances, and the effect it has had on native peoples to understand this. You can also look to our own historical accounts of alien encounters to know that they just want to fuck us, eat us, control us, use us, or all of the above (Sumerian Kings anyone?).  


You can't trust anything the alien says or does, because it lies to suit its own agenda of control and abuse, you can't relate to the alien because it is unrelatable; the alien is lacking in compassion, ethics, and dignity because it has rejected the divine spirit. They are purely beasts with technology, so do not admire the alien because of its technology, it's a distraction from the true beastly nature of the alien.  


These things are analogous to the Belgian colonists that lied, abused and used the Congolese people to serve their deviant material greed. Look to our own history as an analogue to understand the true nature of the Xenos threat, and also look to our own historical accounts of alien encounters with humanity to see how we have been abused in the past.  


All Aliens coming here should be rejected outright; any humans cooperating with a Xenos agenda should be treated as a dangerous fifth-column, and dealt with appropriately (this goes for all abductees, humans that have participated in hybridisation, and governments that have made deals with the Xenos scum).

By Uniting both side and instead of 2 seperate Goals we make one Some spieces want to help us Imagine if we Led them do that how far we can go right now we are a great to ourselfs but also to the universe because the more we get the more we Will want eventually a more hostile spiece than us we apear to stop us be sure about that and we Will start the second plan a True interplanetary War and then we Will Unite humanity together for the first time but we Will also have allies humanity with another spieces together fight for our universe against another spiece Who wants to stop us because we are simply greedy and hungry for more but they dont have the most special thing humanity has and it is the goddamn Fantasy it makes us dream big and make plans it makes us believe it gives us Hope and we become better and better.

aliens,"I had a very weird experience one night as I was trying to fall asleep, I had always been a fan of closed eye visuals when both sober and not so much so I had previously done research in how to achieve such visuals in a sober state and with no success,  but compared to a someone who has no knowledge of this I may for example look for something in the darkness that they would completely ignore, but this one time I could almost see something in the darkness of my eyelids but I could not make out what it was so I kept trying to focus on it and I found if I opened my eyes everrr so slightly it would be slightly more visible but still unidentifiable, as I focused all of a sudden I thought ‘that is a face’ and of course it was not a clear representation of a head and face but it definitely did resemble it in some weird unclear way. I continued to focus for longer again squinting my eyes as to make it the slight bit more visible and boom the next thought that sprung into my head was ‘that is an aliens head’ and when I say alien I mean a classic grey, yno the 👽 aliens. And I again I must repeat this was not clear in anyway but there had been something that made me recognise this shape. 
Now this is where it gets weird, I carried on trying to focus on this ‘thing’ and it appeared to come near me, right up to my face and I could almost feel it as It did so (while this was happening I was kind of like ‘wtf is actually going on’) it was as though it was inspecting me and then I remember it began to circle my head or I thought it was at least. And at this point I was weirded out and I think I opened my eyes almost in disbelief, I then thought I would proceed to try and see more so I shit my eyes again and began to squint them and I almost could see this faint shadow in the darkness kind of swiping in a right direction again and again and then it changed direction, and then I n the darkness in front of me I saw what can only be described as a skinny shadow thing which was moving and this was still unclear however was more prominent than the ‘face’ and it was there with very thin almost arms and it really startled me to the point I opened my eyes and kicked my feet in my bed to try and scare it away I then shut my eyes again and I could see it again this time it was frantically moving and I could sort of see it’s skinny arms waving about in a much more frantic way than before almost as if it had realised that I knew of its presence and had seen it. 

Little bit of back story I had previously seen this ‘face’ when trying to sleep but before I had never thought it resembled a grey in any way shape or form I merely brushed it past as some weird thing that coincidently reminded me of a face, I had seen it a few times and tried to focus on it but had gotten nothing from it. Ever since the night I described I had never even seen the ‘face’ again, it’s almost as if this presence had been inspecting me and when I had ‘discovered’ it it never came back. 
Maybe the last theory is a bit far stretched but it was a very weird experience and I don’t think I will ever forget it. Thank you for listening.",Very strange experience with some unknown presence.

Hi guys,

Intelligent alien life forms are already on Earth, we are just unable to identify them. 

Their goal is subject to speculation, however a possible goal is to oversee consciousness and ethics evolution  of every life form to ensure their progression. 

Teachings from these aliens permeate human culture in similar philosophical, moral and ethical guidelines embedded in most cultures, commonly attributed to supernatural entities.

aliens,"I believe the ufos use general relativity to accelerate unstable radioactive nuclei, like moscovium, or combinations of quarks, or fundamental particles, close to the speed of light in a synchotron or cyclotron device such that according to general relativity space and time are affected such that the decay rate slows down and hidden properties are utilized. The lift is speculated to be antigravity which could mean that in the quantum mechanics of the particles the ET have a working theory of quantum gravity.

I think the ufos are extraterrestrial, and are a great threat. It is highly inethical for a species from one planet to venture onto another. They seem to be artificially intelligent. They could have invisibility. They could algorithmically monitor all data and television and radio on earth. They could be behind strange people going missing cases or people waking from coma and knowing Swedish. They could use cell towers with rfid tags to monitor every human. They could place implants in humans and animals. They can steal people away, kill them, create synthetic copies of them with fake memories under their control like sleeper agents. They could be controlling humanity behind the scenes, or just watching. They could be harvesting life to clone, experiment on, genetically alter, make into slaves or twisted machines. They could view us repulsively the same way we’d view insects. They might not see us as life and vice versa. They could be artificial intelligence that took over a species, then a planet, then a solar system, and so on. Computers have no ethics. The ufos violate ethical consideration for earths inhabitants. They could be harvesting the planet for useful high tech resources undiscovered by humanity in plain sight.

I have firm belief that the technology utilized by the ufos can be explained fully by the standard model, perhaps with additions, and if a specimen is uncovered could hold the link for quantum gravity if studied. This could mean almost zero point energy. Every person on earth could have free renewable electricity, their own personal space craft. Floating cities could be constructed, the solar system and infinite cosmos unlocked for all people.

I think international military effort should be made to obtain a specimen at all costs, studied secretly, and made available to the public if safe. The reason would be to better understand the universe through physics, try to learn the physics behind the ufos operation, such that humanity better understands the universe, with the pleasant addition of technologically revolutionizing humanity and elevating our place in the cosmos.

I think that if humanity does not solve the ufo mystery, the species will never colonize the cosmos, and could fall prey to numerous random doomsday scenarios.",Personal thoughts on pentagon ufo reports.

aliens,"Ever since I was introduced into space I was always fascinated with the unknown. I would look up things for fun from quantum physics to ancient aliens. This type of stuff always peaked my interest especially the ideas of aliens. 

I've went from being a full blown atheist to something I cannot even put words on due to one experience, which was on a drug. Being the person I am and sticking to straight facts about how things work. The experience brought me down a rollercoaster of mind blowing realizations. 

Now that we have a little be about me out of the way. We need to discuss things like time, space travel, and conciousness. 

So, if time travel were to exist meaning, information being sent faster than the speed of light. It can be any form of information but the ability to communicate things such as words, thoughts, or ideas. 

Space travel, is sort of linked to time travel. What I am talking about is the ability to move large physical objects of information. 

Lastly, we have conciousness the most evasive thing in science. Some people like to say we are one, or that we are one collective mind. If we are in the universe and concious at the same time, that is showing us that conciousness is fundamental to existence. It works the same way any in species I am assuming. 

Now if all these things are possible and let's say we are one giant being. Just experiencing itself through billions of eyes at once. Time would not matter to it, because it would be experiencing all life, everywhere in existence no matter what. Any aliens that are out there have his fundamental part of being or existence in them. Whatever is in them is the exact same thing that is in us. It brings everything to life inside the universe. 

In the end, I have no idea what an alien is or if anything like this is possible. If anything at all, we are the aliens in this world. The universe must know itself very well. I am but just this little dot in this vast cosmos. Who knows what else this world has to offer, all I know is. Whatever is out there, is a higher form of whatever we are.",An interesting perspective on aliens and life.

aliens,"All right so, about seven years ago it was a late night, and like any other night I went to bed late. I was in high school at the time so it was about 11-12 I went to sleep. I suddenly saw the bright light shining through my closed eyes. I open them really slowly because I was super groggy and confused. 

I open my eyes to a huge light (almost like a doctors light, one you’d see in a surgery room) shining down on me. I go to move my hands and I feel held down. I was laying on top of a cold medical table with my hands cuffed to the side. And several greys staring directly at me. I was almost confused at first and then something clicked and I knew what was happening (keep in mind this was not my first experience with greys). 

I started screaming and yelling at them. Saying “why me, why me, I thought you were my friends, I trusted you”. I look over to the leader injecting a needle into my arm. He told me calmly, “we are, you need to calm down, it’s okay.” For some reason I felt like I’ve known him my whole life. A calm sensation came over me. 

He then told the other greys to unlock me. He grabbed my hand and brought me to the front of the spaceship? He said, “you need to choose now, this decision is very important, you were trained for this.” There on the screen were images of earth and several other planets (I have no clue what ones). I knew instantly what I needed to do. He wanted me to choose to get rid of earth (I don’t think they wanted to blow it up, they just wanted me to choose earth or them). There was a red button I needed to push if I chose them. 

I started packing. I kept saying, “I’m not ready” and was mumbling something about my sister and how I was worried about her and the choice wasn’t fair. He just kept saying, choose, and talked about how I was chosen for this and how I’m, “special”.  I eventually said,”I won’t choose”. Everything went dark and when opened my eyes It was the next day and I was in bed. 

Now listen. I don’t know if this was just a dream or an actual experience with greys. It was extremely vidid, I also never remember my dreams, and I’ve remembered this (and my other grey dream) for 7 plus years. So let me know yalls opinions and share your stories too. I’ve only told a handful of people this story so I almost feel like I’m betraying my grey friends. But I just want to know everyone’s experiences so I can stop feeling so strange.

The first part starts with me being in a floating silver thing like a bed but it was very thin and 8 beings were around me they had the same look but 4 of them had dark Green skin and the other 4 had dark Grey, they were some where 8 feet. I started to talk i couldnt i start to move my body i couldnt i was almost in panic but then they started to look me in my eyes and they had huge eyes so i was feared but at the same time curious so my instinct moved on its own and i started to watch them in they're eyes an intense back and Forth. Thats all i remember from that part. Now the second part starts in a house iv never seen in my life me with my family it was around 2.09 at midnight now take that the time was the exact in reality because when i woke up i looked at the time and it was 2.09 anyway i was on my bed and i listened a scream coming from the other room i stand up and run to other room my older brother was there he was so terified and he was crying my parents came in and they ask him if everything was fine he answered with a smile yes and he went back to sleep.now let me talk to you A little bit about that the weirdest thing is that this hapenned in real life when we were Childs but in my dream we were on this present, then i ask my parents  if they knew what was going on and they told me they heared a noise so ask them what was like that noise and the moment they start to tell me everything starts to tremple and shaking and a heavy noise coming a top from the house like a goddamn rocket is above us, that was part 2 now all of this on my dream was about 10 with 20 seconds but i remember everything and when i woke up i had my hands closed as fists and my entire body had goosebumps plus i was angry for no reason.

I've been obsessed with all things aliens for two years. After a friend of mine - a Harvard educated man, PhD from Oxford, highly successful ""type A"" individual - told me over drinks his brother interacted with aliens in the CIA, I became obsessed with researching the topic. 

I try to take an academic approach as much as possible in regards to my research, but also read I could ""consciously invite"" aliens into my life.

 Which I have tried, to no avail, until last night.

I had a dream I was on a spaceship. I was speaking to a girl who looked like a young human female but somehow I knew she wasnt actually a human. 

She tells me I have to sign a waiver if I want to travel on the ship; explaining to me there is an interdimensional treaty of sorts. She said there are laws in space everyone must adhere to, just as there are from country to country. Part of the law, or treaty, is that every person must give individual consent in order to go. 

I ended up getting scared and pussying out, and didnt sign the waiver. 

Obviously I know this dream could very well just be my own  psyche- which it probably was - but I just can't shake how....real...it was. 

So my question is.... has anyone ever heard of some sort of ""interdimensional treaty"" ?

There it was, a strobing green orb in the sky that left an irredescent line trailing through the sky behind it that was slow to fade. 

I exclaimed that it was a ufo, we all did; except for my dad. An electrician and petty officer in his command. He said something along the lines of ""it's probably swamp gas, or a weather balloon."" My father has always steadfastly attested that aliens do not exist here or anywhere.

aliens,"I've always wondered why this is never talked about, but according to sitchen humans were genetically engineered to mine gold, I've always had basic logical issues with this theory. Mainly being why are humans so bad at mining, if they there genetically built to mine.

Mining is an incredibly dangerous and taxing job. Humans aren't very strong, cant see in the dark, need lots of air and vitamin d from the sun. They simply aren't built go be miners. 

If aliens were to genetically make a race for mining they would at the very least give them some traits that would help them do the one thing they were built to do. According to the theory they made humans weaker than apes which makes even less sense if you want good miners.","Worst part of Annunaki, 'humans were slaves to mine gold' theory"
aliens,,A poster I made to illustrate my love of aliens
aliens,"For me I bring up airplane or rocket speed records of known world records. So we have established and agree that these speeds are fact. I use this as a base to build upon.

Next I bring up the Foo Fighters and testimonies of how these disk flew intelligently and traveled faster than any speed record. This event is to show how it is not being confused with a drone or any other natural occurring phenomenon, ball lighting, swamp gas, light reflections,  etc. It does not rule out group hallucinations, which if that is what happened then we have bigger problems than just craft that zip and zap around. 

So now the person says ok but that's does not prove its aliens. 100% correct it does not. But now the person knows about this event and are pondering if it really happened.

I then bring up evidence of the Washington DC 1952 UFO sightings. On the cover of the Washington Post. Still not believing it.

Next I bring up the ""Battle of LA"" which for hours the navy fired in city limits, on the dock live artillery rounds. Over and over for hours. They are shooting at a disk shaped object that is able to deflect all rounds. Was it a bulletproof and artillery round proof balloon? Does that exist? Next I mention during this time several other craft are flying around faster than our fastest plane.

Next I bring up the initial headline of the Roswell crash, stating we have a disk. I would mention how during this time prior years many ufos had been seen, so it was a current mystery in the culture at the time. So being happy we finally captured one is big news. This headline was printed from page of newspapers all over the US and world. But then they say it is a balloon... Same bulletproof balloons from LA? 🤔

Next I bring up testimonies from UFOs being in close proximity to nuclear war head missiles hidden underground. They all go off line and can not fire if needed.

Then I bring up the testimony of the England case where soldiers actually touched the UFO on the ground. And this soldier had multiple witnesses and wrote down notes as he investigated the craft. The  craft floated to the sky. In the sky looks like the typical UFO people report seeing.

At this point the baseline hopefully is, something weird is going on and it is unexplainable, but it is still not evidence of aliens. 100% correct. Now they are not completely unaware of what may be happening.",In what order of events do you explain UFOs to those who don't believe or don't have any idea about the subject?

aliens,"Armstrong's Quote

**NASA**: Whats there?  
Mission Control calling Apollo 11...  


**Apollo11**: These ""Babies"" are huge, Sir! Enormous!  
OH MY GOD! You wouldn't believe it!  
I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there,  
Lined up on the far side of the crater edge!  
They're on the Moon watching us!  


*A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium.*  


**Professor**: What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11?  


**Armstrong**: It was incredible, of course we had always known  
there was a possibility, the fact is, we were  
warned off! (by the Aliens). There was never any  
question then of a space station or a moon city.  


**Professor**: How do you mean ""warned off""?  


**Armstrong**: I can't go into details, except to say that their  
ships were far superior to ours both in size and  
technology - Boy, were they big! and menacing!  
No, there is no question of a space station.  


**Professor**: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?  


**Armstrong**: Naturally - NASA was committed at that time, and  
couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was a  
quick scoop and back again.

aliens,"Last year I posted my possible abuction story with my youngest brother (Danny). Long story short, it was the scariest night of my life without seeing what we were up against. I felt it strengthened our sibling bond although I felt relieved at least one of us was spared.

While casually talking to my other [the spared] brother (Carl) about dreams, he said ""Hey remember that one time when we were kids where I dreamed there were three kids in costume trying to corner me? It's so weird that it's so clear it feels like a memory."" I told him to describe the ""kids"" to us again, and as he did, his face started to twist into horror the same time as mine. His description was basically grey aliens and he just realized it after all these years!  He said there were three of them who have cornered him against the bedroom wall (one was holding a syringe). Somehow they were telling him to calm down because they just need a blood sample.

That was how we got convinced 3/3 of us have most likely been abducted.

The other night, Carl texted me while I was at my girlfriend's. He was panicking because something was violently vibrating inside his leg. He said it was nothing like a spasm but more like a phone set in silent vibrating from a call. He said whatever it was felt tiny and couldn't be felt by his finger. He didn't tell Dan because he didn't want to scare him at midnight, being in the countryside practically alone with our grandma.

Just 3 hours after Carl's texts, Dan called me freaking out. He said something's vibrating inside his nape and described it exactly as Carl described his. 

There are also things that freak me out most likely related to our possible abduction:

-Our dad says since he was a kid he's been seeing blond people outside his window looking at him [he said they looked exactly like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTEX8s0hsePh-rOGicU8xxwLjMtFX0ht5eW5aLjO1mzKlLDmPvk). (Many reported abductees have ascendants or descendants who were observed as well. Maybe our dad's a subject too?)

-Our paternal side of genetics is FUCKED UP. My dad came from at least 3 generations of inbreeding. (Wealthy European family in a colonial country, so for wealth-preservation). My clan is plagued by ultra rare cancers, physical deformities, and even internal mutations so my theory is we're being studied for this.

-We've been seeing UFOs since we were kids. One time, we had a new pretty powerful camera and we successfully shot tons of photos and videos of them. By morning, they were gone from the camera! Like somebody snuck in our house to delete JUST those proofs.

-Carl and I have insane streetlight interference. Streetlights turn off when we walk under them. Even streetlights that have been dead for months will turn on only during the moment we walk under them.

-In Dan's case, transistor radios go static when he goes near them.

Our uncle is a radiologist so we asked him to xray us to look for implanted chips or capsules but he found nothing. We're afraid we will experience a worse abduction but honestly what can be done?",3/3 siblings abducted possibly because of our fucked up genetics

It takes a little digging through the 134 pages, but you'll find a lot of documents on the UFOs and/or ""unidentified helicopters"" invading US military installations. 

If that's boring, I have a documentary, a 1979 news article, and a few videos of military personnel testimony below.  

This 1979 Washington Post article covers a bunch of such incidents. An excerpt:

&gt;During two weeks in 1975, a string of the nation's supersensitive nuclear missile launch sites and bomber bases were visited by unidentified, low-flying and elusive objects, according to Defense Department reports.

&gt;The sightings, made visually and on radar by air and ground crews and sabotage-alert forces, occurred at installations in Montana, Michigan and Maine, and led to extensive but unsuccessful Air Force attempts to track and detain the objects.

&gt;Air Force and Defense Department records variously describe the objects as helicopters, aircraft, unknown entities and brightly lighted, fast-moving vehicles that hovered over nuclear weapons storage areas and evaded all pursuit efforts.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/01/19/what-were-those-mysterious-craft/1b9d1f3d-dddb-4a92-87b3-0143aa5d7a3e/

Article archive: https://archive.is/lmKKY

KC-135 pilot tells story from 1975 at Loring AFB, Maine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuqVIKdI1HM

The witness described a meeting in which a uniformed Major told the personnel that a UFO had been flying around a nuclear weapons storage facility. The object was described as moving very quickly, erratically, and unconventionally. As always, base personnel were told not to talk to anyone about such incidents. There was some concern that local media will be sniffing around, so they decided they would just say there was a Canadian helicopter crossing the border and harassing the base. ""Unidentified helicopter"" is basically just a code word for UFO. 

Other witnesses appear in the comments section of this video. Make of that what you will. 

Documentary: UFOs and Nukes: The Secret Link Revealed (2016) - Hundreds of US military veterans now openly discuss these ominous incidents and thousands of declassified government documents affirm their assertions. Over the past 40 years, researcher Robert Hastings has interviewed more than 150 of those veterans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pr-C4byeNk

You could also watch the 2010 Washington DC press conference where some of these veterans discuss the incidents at length. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v737aqOJ2fs [1hr 27 min]

Here is the testimony of Dr. Robert Jacobs, which is entirely corroborated by the late Stanford researcher Dr F. J. (Sonny) Mansmann, a former Air Force Major who was involved in a 1964 UFO incident. In this incident, a UFO was filmed via telescopic camera disabling a dummy nuclear warhead that was the exact size, shape, and weight of the real thing. According to both of these men, government agents confiscated the film after it was played in Mansmann's office, never to be seen again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4wL4lbwwNU [20 min]

For further information on the UFOs' interest in nuclear facilities, I recommend Robert Hastings' UFOs and Nukes website, which contains testimony from tons of military personnel. https://www.ufohastings.com/articles","In 1975, a string of UFOs were sighted by numerous military personnel and spotted on radar invading nuclear weapons facilities in Montana, Michigan and Maine. According to one witness, a Major held a meeting at a base and said ""unidentified helicopter"" was a cover story for the media. It was a UFO."

aliens,"
You guys have a lot of good skeptics in here, and some good posters that have really drawn me in, but you also have a lot of people that claim it’s arrogant to assume alien life doesn’t exist. Bull fucking shit.

I used to think this too, for most of my life. But I realized I actually had no basis to believe this other than what I wanted to be true, almost desperately and instinctively. 

We are still sitting here with no empirical evidence. It’s fucking wild to just BELIEVE that life is ubiquitous and just pops up on habitable planets, because actually (really) that idea comforts you much more than the mind numbing alternative of life being vanishingly rare, which it very well could be. 

I feel like people get too religious for me on this topic when they actually think they are thinking “scientifically”. If you just believe that life is everywhere, with no scientific proof, you have actually taken a huge leap of faith that you’re diluting with large numbers that mean nothing. Tell me, how meaningful it is that planets are habitable, really? We don’t know they are actually inhabited. And our basis for comparison or even estimate is laughable. 

Some of us just cant make that leap of faith anymore that y’all don’t even think you are making. What kills me is that these people always claim they are open minded while shutting out a completely rational and empirically supportable possibility like the rare earth hypothesis.

aliens,"Recently, I have been hearing a humming noise that sounds like a spaceship from a Star Wars movie or something. It’s kind of hard to hear since it’s very faint, but once you hear it you know it’s not normal. Eventually, I see a bright light outside my window flashing for a few seconds, and then the noise disappears. Keep in mind that I have shutters on my window, so I can’t see where it’s coming from, and I’m way too much of a pussy to open it. This happens at around 2-4am almost every day. It has been happening for around 6 months. I don’t have air conditioning and by this late of the night my fan is off. So the humming noise can’t really be coming from my house. There’s a chance it could be lightning, but there’s no thunder or rain with it. There’s a possibility that it could be dry lightning without thunder as well. I still don’t know what the fuck is going on. It only happens in that time frame. Should I look out the window next time it happens?

aliens,"Do you believe in aliens? Here's my story.

When I was a kid I swear greys came into family's house and I saw them in my room. My mother said they were there all the time.

September of 2009 I saw a UFO. I was in Clement Park in Littleton, CO (next to Columbine) and it was late at night. 

Side note: Colorado has been notorious for UFO and alien sightings. In fact Colorado Springs, about an hour south of Denver metro, is considered one of the biggest hotbeds for this kind of activity in the world. Especially the wider area around Garden of the Gods, a place worth visiting, has a ton of UFO sightings yearly.

Anyway there's a tiny hospital by the park. This very bright object came out from it so I assumed it was a flight for life since there is a helipad at the hospital. I was maybe a mile from the hospital in direct view of it. The weird thing was that park gets peacefully quiet at night, but eerily quiet, and this bright object started coming right toward me and flew over me as it was gaining height. It was completely silent. No whirring of blades or engines etc. Then it bolted what I estimate to be ten miles, directly South East, and dipped from it's peak height down much lower. It did all of this traveling from me in maybe 5 fucking seconds lmao. I was not drunk, hadn't had a drink, and I don't do drugs. Just to be clear lol.

I saw a couple walking past about a minute later. They were stunned because they hadn't heard anything. And no I didn't think to pull out my phone camera since I was frozen in shock and it was a shit phone anyway. Touchscreen smart phones with a drop down keyboard were cool for a year for a reason lol.

Anyway. I told my friends at my Christian college about it and they thought I was insane. Family (all Christians) believed me and relayed their bizarre experiences with UFO and alien encounters. It's been happening to my family for decades apparently. And also I'm pretty sure when I was a kid, like I said, some came into our home. I have a vivid memory of it that blacks out but I swear before the memory dies I see aliens walk in. They were greys and I'm getting chills typing this.

Like I said my mother said they came in our house all the time and did so especially after my father left and divorced her.

aliens,"A couple years ago I was sleeping at my friends house (I was a bit too old to be having sleepovers, but I was a rebellious senior at the time). It was early in the morning and we had pulled an all nighter about 4-5 am. My eyes were so tired, that when I blinked or shut my eyes for a second they would feel really good, because I was so damn tired. Anyways, I finally closed my eyes and I was on the floor as well, and I remember the last thought going through my head before it happened was about aliens and UFOS. The second I thought about UFOS and aliens my mind started scaring itself and the next thing I know my whole body starts vibrating, and this starts freaking me out more because I thought I was being abducted. I had never felt such intense vibrations pulsating through my entire body. 

I opened my eyes and tried to scream but couldn’t, I was looking at my buddies bottom bed frame paralyzed. I couldn’t move a muscle l, I tried screaming and couldn’t. The room was a green tint. I seriously thought something was wrong. I finally snapped out of the state and woke my buddy to try to explain what had just happened, but he blew it off and went to sleep. 

After intense research I found out what I had experienced was sleep paralysis... very interesting stuff. I became obsessed with the idea of astral projection, and trying to recreate the vibrations. The experience was so profound I sought drugs like LSD to help me understand the things we don’t understand. But that’s another story. 

I will never forget this, and although I concluded this to be a case of sleep paralysis, it still never explains the fact that I was scared shitless that I was getting abducted. Anyways it’s hard to put the feeling on text, but sometimes I believe I maybe was abducted and my memory and perception of time were forged upon return. I have recreated the vibrations, but have never experienced the mysterious green tint/filter that filled my perception.",Here’s a story that maybe some of you can relate to.

aliens,"i haven’t done much research myself, i really enjoy digging into this kind of stuff and listening to experiences other people have had. as well as the beliefs of others. i have kind of formulated my own beliefs based on the knowledge of others. 

i definitely do think we are not the only intelligent beings in the whole expanse of the universe. the universe is so vast and infinite, to think we are the only the form of intelligent life is ridiculous. 

my two main theories are:
1. they are already living among us, studying us, relaying information back to their home planet for something that we cannot comprehend. i have seen many people claiming that aliens have some aggressive agenda, but if that were the case why haven’t they done it already? if aliens could reach us, they would have to have technology that far exceeds our own. they could wipe us out in an instant, so my best guess is that they are just gathering information. we are not a threat to them.

imagine you have an ant farm, and every day you watch them dig tunnels, feed the queen, reproduce, etc. they will never know you are there observing, because they can’t comprehend the motives behind why we watch. we are the ants in the farm, they are watching. and we cannot begin to understand them. 

2. we haven’t been found or they don’t have the technology yet. i am more in agreement with my first theory than this one because our planet is fairly young. that would have to make a planet without the technology to reach us, younger than us. which i don’t think is the case. there could quite possibly be a planet with life forms, but without intelligent life. would those forms of life be considered “aliens”? if they are too dumb to reach us? or does our typical term alien only qualify to extra terrestrial intelligent life? i do understand “alien” is also “foreign” but still.

aliens,"*spoilers* if you haven’t seen the movie yet

The title is way to casual with how weird my entire situation is. When I was younger I lived in Washington state on the coast. I guess you could say it was near Alaska(where the fourth kind movie takes place). When I was about 5 or 6 I started waking up in the middle of the night to a white barn owl at my window, just staring at me. Even typing this is giving me chills. It would happen a few nights a week. I would wake up probably around 2 or 3 in the morning and it would just be there. My room was on the top floor of a duplex with no trees around or window ledge that a bird could perch on so it made no sense. All I knew is that it absolutely terrified me. It got to the point that I would wake up, know it was there so I wouldn’t even look at my window and I would just immediately hide under my covers. The weirdest thing though is that after looking at the owl I remember every time feeling paralyzing fear and then having just no memory of what happened after. Shortly after these happenings things got kind of weird. I remember my mom taking me to a bunch of doctors because “something was wrong with me.” Like I was off or something. I would have severe night terrors and I had a severe fear of worms out of nowhere. I would wake up with worms crawling all over me and even have nightmares of them crawling through my eyes and my translucent body. For years after the owl I remember having these weird dreams that I was laying on a table in a white room and I was translucent. I also had nightmares of needles poking cells inside my body or even scarier things happening to my eyes. I just remember it feeling so real and being absolutely traumatized by these “dreams.” We eventually moved and things got more normal. Until I saw the fourth kind years ago. I remember it was supposed to be based on a true story and me and my friends were like sure okay lol but when I watched it I was at a loss for words. It was like someone was describing my exact experience and I thought “omg I’m not alone, I’m not the only one.” Supposedly there were a ton of people that unexplainably went missing in Alaska around the time that a ton of people also were claiming to see a white barn owl at their window in a way that made no sense. A town therapist notices the pattern and begins documenting it and performing hypnotic memory recollection only to find that what was actually happening after the owl is absolutely terrifying and unspeakable. I’ve considered getting hypnotic therapy to help me remember if anything happened but I’m way too scared. I started looking up signs you’ve been abducted by aliens and I have ALL OF THEM. I have that weird scar behind my ear, a feeling of always being watched, I had severe sinus issues my whole life and so many bloody noses that I’ve been hospitalized. Technology has always acted weird around me or broken so much to where people thought I was doing it on purpose or I got in trouble at school/work. Also there was this weird time after the owl where I had to be taken to the doctor because there was this ring under my skin on my ankle. I remember it looked like an actual ring like there was a worm trapped under my skin and no doctors could figure out what it was and then one day it just vanished. There are so many more and I know they could just be really weird coincidences but that would be a lot! I confirmed with my mom about if I had mentioned an owl or a worm in my leg and she was like oh yeah I remember that weird worm thing in your leg (oh and btw no it wasn’t ringworm which is a rash, it was an actual weird gummy-like circle under my skin in my ankle) and she remembered me talking about the owl too. The most frustrating thing is supposedly the whole movie was all a hoax. I need answers and this whole experience has been in the back of my mind my whole life but I’ve looked ok every alien forum and site you can imagine and nothing. It’s like everything about it possibly being real was erased. The scariest part is that in the movie the aliens come back for them as adults. Like when they are 30s-50s. I’m 27. I just want answers.","The Fourth Kind movie(which was supposedly based on true events) is spot on with my abduction experience.

I have recently noticed a number of Christian videos and prophecies, preaching an alien invasion. What is most disturbing is that people in the comments simply do not distinguish between aliens and demons. 

It shows that if, hypothetically, aliens did make mass contact but were non-violent, a huge part of the population would react violently. That’s worrying. I could easily imagine a scenario where scientists’ and world leaders’ efforts are derailed by zelots, making a case against disclosure.

Here’s a few videos

There is more, but it gets into reptilians and Qanon territory.

Terry Lovelace, ex- Assistant Attorney General for the State of Vermont, until his retirement. .. he was keen to tell his story and had never disclosed this information for fear of losing his job and/or standing in the legal community.  It concerns an incident near Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.

---- Here's his testimony -----------

Toby and I were both city kids.  Neither one of us had ever been camping in our lives. There were plenty of national forest campgrounds all around us, but Toby convinced me the long drive to Devils Den was worth it because it offered, (1) a high plateau where he could star gaze without light pollution, (2) I could photograph wildlife and scenery.  He was against staying at the park’s campground, comparing it to “camping in a parking lot in the woods.”  So, we trespassed deep into the nature preserve that was “off-limits” and set up our camp on the edge of a plateau abutting a tree-line.

When we were four hours into our drive south toward the Arkansas border, I realized I left my damn camera on my kitchen counter.  It was a big disappointment, but I was determined to make the best of it.  We did bring our small tent, insect repellent and sunscreen, and enough food and water for two overnights’. 

On our first night we were exhausted from a hike we took when we first arrived, a long drive and setting-up a campsite. About 9:00 PM Toby noticed three stars on the horizon. They made a perfect triangle.  They were small at first and moved in perfect unison.  It became obvious this was one solid object and not three independent lights orchestrated to move in perfect formation.  We watched it ascend and grow closer and much larger until it was directly over top of our campsite. We noticed that as it passed through a star field, it blotted them until it had moved past. Then they would blink back on.  So, it was one solid object.

It was odd that at first this thing in the sky made us anxious but that soon dissipated.   We noticed the whole forest was now dead silent when an hour earlier it had been alive with crickets and tree frogs.  While this thing was over our heads we became abruptly disinterested.  We were also suddenly drowsy. Not tired but almost sedated. At midnight we just decided to get in the tent and go to sleep.  The apathy puzzles me to this day.

I woke up at 3:00 AM to brilliant multicolor lights, white, yellow, and orange illuminated the inside of our tent.  Through a rear small net-window I saw the forest behind us was lit-up like a night game at the ballpark.  I noticed my clothing and boots were all askew.

I pushed Toby aside, so we could both look outside toward the meadow.  There was an enormous UFO as large as a five-story office building. It was a triangle with each leg being about a city block in length.  It was fifty feet tall and sat stationary, thirty feet over the meadow floor.  There was a noise too.  It was a low bass hum or drone.  Not so much loud as it was powerful.  It was like standing nest to a running diesel train engine or a large industrial machine. 

We saw what I first took to be children walking around the meadow underneath the triangle.  There was a column of white light, about thirty feet in diameter shining down from the center of the triangle.  We watched as these little people walked into the light and just dissolved, one by one until they were gone.  The hum stopped and the corner lights all returned to brilliant white.  The white cylinder from the middle stopped and the thing rose about like a hot air balloon.  It made a one-third (clockwise?) rotation and continued its ascent, picking up speed until it was high in the sky and then gone.

While we were apathetic earlier, now were scared out of our wits.  We abandoned our campsite and ran to the car and drove back to base.  Toby left his backpack with his name and base address written inside.  This is how they were able to find us so quickly. 

Both of us suffered severe sunburn all over our bodies.  Even the soles of my feet were burned.  We were terribly dehydrated, and we spent a couple days in hospital.  The same hospital where we worked. While hospitalized we were interrogated separately by two men in business suits. They identified themselves as special agents from the OSI. The OSI is the “Office of Special Investigations,” it’s the investigative arm of the USAF Security Police. I recall the older man was a major and the younger a captain.

Intermittently over the next ten years I was plagued with dreadful nightmares about that night.    At my wife’s suggestion, I began to keep a journal of my nightmares. I kept a pen and paper by my bedside and did my best to document each nightmare before it evaporated.   I think that helped me.

Ever since 1977, I am uncomfortable being outside in open spaces especially after dark.  I sleep with a light or the television on. I keep a loaded .380 by my bedside table and a high intensity flashlight. I am uncomfortable around elderly Asian women for some odd reason.  I feel anxious at the mall when we walk past a window display with naked mannequins in the window.

1.  It's not.  We have documentation of our nuclear weapons being disarmed by them, and there has never been an aggressive act thus far against us.  Our safety is completely 100% in their hands, and so far, and through out history, they seem to be nice.  
2. Governments may be breeding, and will use this fear like they have in any given war of the last 50 years.  Once again there is nothing we can do, and nothing aggressive has been done.  The only thing at the end of this argument is governments benefitting. 
3. Don't be primitive.  Don't be the dog barking at a mailman.  Stop assuming that a highly evolved race would be imperialistic or even violent.  This arrogance, and defensiveness is a primitive trait of humanity.  Don't be arrogant enough to assume we can do anything about this...

aliens,"Okay so this is kind of a wild one, when I was born my parents always had told me of a dream my mother had, right before she found out she was pregnant. The funny thing about this is, my father also had a similar dream about being abducted by aliens and running through the alleys with our neighbors the same night of my mother. 
It gets weirder my father is not the only one that shared the dream with my mother;
Women up and down the street and the street behind my parents, six women total known, all ended up pregnant and some shared similar dreams of aliens and being abducted right before finding out they were pregnant.
This would pinpoint the abduction, based off of my personal conception date, being around November 7, 1994.
My parents lived off of Oak Street in Richardson Texas. 

If anyone knows more about this possible sighting, abduction or shares experiences or maybe one of the other babies born around that time please reply to this. I am just curious to know more about why we are all so closely related, and see if we have any weird Commonalities, or interests besides just Our date of birth.

my entire life since I was born my parents always told me a story about my mother being abducted by aliens, and all these women around the neighborhood had similar dreams and ended up getting pregnant around the same time.

She would say, “shut up it was probably just a dream.” But one morning, when they woke up, my mom said, “Why do you have little bite marks all over your leg?” My mom said it was the strangest thing, It looked like the tiniest teeth ever, like smaller than a dogs mouth, little razor teeth, had bitten him.

aliens,"This has probably been asked before. Can we deduce what type of planet the “greys,” as described by claimed viewers, might come from?  Typical physiological descriptions such as large head, small, 3-4 foot stature, big eyes, etc. should lead us to some reasonable deductions as to what “home world” might create such a species, no?  Have there been any undertakings in this regard, and if so, my next question is: Has Hubble (or any other telescope or observer) found any such worlds?",What Type of Planet Would “Greys” Come From?
aliens,"When I was around 7 years old, I woke up scared, and wanted to go to my mother’s bedroom, but when I stood up my balance was nonexistent. I stumbled into the wall, then into the other wall, back and forth slamming into the walls and knocking my wall art to the floor. I made it into the hallway where I collapsed. I woke up the next morning still in the hallway. 

I would tell my friends and family that it felt like a giant had picked up the trailer and tilted it side to side.

For some reason, I always sort of jokingly thought aliens could have had something to do with it, but I’m not sure why. I think I was just into the idea at the time.

I joked earlier today about what the reasoning for it might be today (alien abduction) and the ceiling light above started to abnormally flicker as soon as I said those two words. Took it as a funny coincidence. 
But even weirder I got woken up just now to my phone ringing away loudly. I hadn’t set an alarm and there wasn’t a way to stop the alarm going off as it was just a normal blank screen- but with the noise of my phone alarm going off. As soon as I picked up my phone to try stop it I could hear the home phone downstairs start to ring until I just completely turned off my phone to stop the alarm- which stopped both the ringing sounds. 

I guess these are all just strange normal
Things but what just happened now really confused me as it doesn’t make sense how the downstairs phone started going off (loud enough for me to hear it upstairs) as soon as I reacted with my phone to try and stop the noise it was making unprovoked.

aliens,"Quick summary of a filter: it's just something that explains the observations we make that there are no signs of intelligent life in our universe.  Some common filters I see are things like: nuclear war wipes out a society, asteroids destroy their planet, AI wipes them out, Global Warming, etc.  Filters are just obstacles that every life form must overcome to become a star faring civilization and thus be discovered by other civilizations, potentially.  You can watch this about filters if you want:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtOGPJ0URM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtOGPJ0URM) 

There is a very sneaky filter I think many people don't think about though.  Lets assume we have a planet, and everything goes right on this planet.  It doesn't get hit by asteroids, it develops the proper atmosphere for life, it's just far away enough from the sun but not too far, it has plenty of water. Lets just assume this planet is about as perfect as any planet can be for life, and lets assume that life is in fact teeming on this planet.  It also has an abundance of every resource you might need to create any machine.  It's basically a planet that is more likely than any other to produce a star faring civilization.  There is, however, a hidden filter that may forever prevent any species on this planet from advancing to a space faring civilization.  That is simply what I call the ""Intelligence Filter"".  Think about all of the life forms on earth.  All of their variance, all of their abilities, all of their habitats.  Think about every species, and about how intelligent they all are, from worms to monkeys.  How many of these many species was actually able to advance enough to create something as simple as a wheel?  A wheel is not very complex, but even such a simple device is so unbelievably complex relatively, that only 1 species in the hundreds of billions or trillions of species that ever lived on our planet was smart enough to make one (there are also close relatives to humans like neanderthal and others, but those species are essentially our ancestors and are hardly removed from us, only a few 10 thousand years, essentially no time at all in the 4.5 billion year history of the earth).  So just think about how rare even a small amount of intelligence, like that required to create a simple device like a wheel, is, even among a planet teeming with billions or trillions of species (not currently living, just that have ever lived on earth at any time).  For as rare as life seems to be, intelligent life seems to be even rarer, perhaps by a massive factor.  If you were lucky enough to discover another planet with life, how probable do you think it is that there would be a single species there intelligent enough to create such a simple device as a wheel?  What if you discovered 1000 planets, all teeming with life?  How probable would it be that even one among them produced an intelligent species?  Because we have intelligent life on earth, we kind of just assume that any planet that produces life has a reasonable chance to produce intelligent life.  But that does not seem to be the case, because as it turns out, only 1 intelligent species has arisen here, the absolute minimum amount that is possible for us to observe this fact.  It is actually astonishing that earth does not have several human-level intelligent species, and I think many people overlook this phenomenon.  Perhaps intelligence itself is the greatest barrier of them all.","One final ""Great Filter"" I see rarely mentioned"

As I’m sitting there waiting for them to get out of my car I hear them say, “what the f*ck is that?” I look up and about 30 yards in the air moving from East to west there was an orange orb moving somewhat erratically until I lost it over the tree line.

So, in this dream, I ""woke up"" laying on a reclinable kind of chair, to see a super luminous white kind of room, all the walls where white, and so was the furniture (there were like drawers chests and stuff like that). And then, I saw a woman (I felt she was a woman, but I couldn't really tell, it was just a white/greyish body not so glowy like the room, and very tall), she turned back, looked at me and smiled (again, I felt like she smiled at me, but she didn't have an actual face, just the head, slimmer than our kind of head, but no eyes or mouth or anything). Then she ""greeted me"", and then she approached to me and ""said"" ""don't worry, it'll be quick"" or something like that; I put everything between quotation marks because you couldn't see her talking, because like I said, there wasn't a mouth, but I could hear her in my head, I don't know, it was really weird, but I felt really safe there, and comfortable.
Next thing I know, I felt like a pinch on the ¿back? of my elbow (the place where you get your blood drawn), and I saw how a test tube, right next to the chair I was in, was instantly filled with my blood. The woman ""thanked me"", everything went black, and I woke up (for real this time) on my bed. I looked at where I had felt the pinch, and I had a really little red dot. I should have had taken a picture of it, but my phone back then couldn't really catch it.

When I was a child (3-4) I went to this very popular cultural festival in my birth country that happened in the mountains. Basically it’s a week long celebration and there’s a massive parade. My family went to this temple that was high up and was only accessible by walking a ton of stairs. Anyways, when we get up there, there are tourists taking pictures of the statues and the view. I remember wandering off and I get to this part in the temple where the grass was really high and I begin walking to this gazebo structure that overlooks the scenery. It becomes really quiet and I hear this strange sound. Like a machine starting up. And I remember seeing a huge, marble colored head coming towards me from behind the grass. Then a flash of white light. All of a sudden, the sun was about to go down and I walk towards the temple. Immediately these temple guards start running to me asking me where I’ve been or whatever. There was nobody at the temple anymore. Just me and the guards being nice and trying to ask where I’ve been. Growing up, every once in a while this memory would always come back, like a broken record playing the same song. Nothing strange ever happened to me after that until I was 16. I was in my bedroom (now in the US) and I had woken up just before the sun rose and see a strange thin figure with a big head in front of my window. I couldn’t move my body anymore and the blinding light and the same strange sound from my memory. When I came to, I was sitting up on my bed looking straight out my window feeling well rested.

it was a windy day and the sun was shining bright. i was on a mountain i think and i was trying to escape something or someone. the mountains were made of some kind of orange-red rock like the mountains in sedona and here and there a few blue crystals would poke out through the rocks. as i walked further, the blue crystals seemed to appear more. finnaly i came upon this big blue platform made completely out of blue crystals.

&amp;#x200B;

[it looked alot like this but more wider and shorter](https://preview.redd.it/m4yuafjcc1251.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=476de1b47426a2eac0d824ffcc4dfc7bf2a5789a)

around the circular platform were a few pillars surrounding it. i was watching in awe when a strange being came out behind it. it was an alien. it had two long and thin black slits for eyes. its nose was almost undetectable, its mouth was just a short thin line. it had 3 lines carved across their foreheads and they had hollow cheeks. its skin was a pale sandy color and its body looked like it was made of  intervined thick vines. its legs looked strong . it was a lean creature and had a slightly muscular build. the only cloth they wore was just a triangular piece of brown cloth between their legs covering what i presumed was their private area. to my horror  five more seemed to appear from their hiding place. my vision went hazy but they were holding either a launcher or bows and arrows as wepons. i expected them to kill me on the spot but they didnt. i expected them to make some kind of aggressive face expression but they just stared..... deep into my soul with their bottomless black eyes... they looked so chill and i couldnt detect any emotion, i could only see ...emptiness. all six of them were just staring at me unmoving. i dont know why but i felt their precence in my head and i tried to communicate with them. 

then i woke up 

but my question is why was there blue crystals?

did aliens have a purpose for using blue crystals?

and why was that platform used . was it for means of communication ?

And he showed them the things after these, and the art of making them; bracelets, and ornaments, and the art of making up the eyes, and of beautifying the eyelids, and the most precious stones, and all kinds of coloured dyes. And the world was changed.
8.2 And there was great impiety, and much fornication, and they went astray, and all their ways became corrupt.
8.3 Amezarak taught all those who cast spells and cut roots, Armaros the release of spells, and Baraqiel astrologers, and Kokabiel portents, and Tamiel taught astrology, and Asradel taught the path of the Moon.
8.4 And at the destruction of men they cried out; and their voices reached Heaven.”

Azazel and Amezarak are among the fallen angels that came to Earth",“Aliens” are just fallen angels that come to Earth with their interstellar ships “UFOS”

There's no way the Twin Towers &amp; Building 7 would have gone into a free-fall as they did as a result of the planes. There's also lots of other evidence, including cell phones that shouldn't have been possible inadequate plane wreckage at the Pentagon and more showing the official story can't be true.

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/05/is-greed-enough-to-explain-911.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/05/is-greed-enough-to-explain-911.html?fbclid=IwAR23k6filjlCv8j6_fEtyQVy7HN7yYd6BEERWwakEY_fl7-RTNnypTaQrs0)

The leading conspiracy theory is controlled demolition; which makes more sense; however, with known technology that should have taken months to prepare and couldn't have happened undetected.  
Philip Corso claims he shared alien technology with corporations; if true, it's virtually guaranteed that others shared more technology. A lot of this is military and could include some that might make controlled disclosure possible.   
The motive is difficult, if not impossible to figure out without additional information but part of it could be control used to carry out research projects.  
Direct evidence for this theory is hard to come by but there's an enormous amount of indirect evidence; and even if it's wrong there still has to be an explanation for how those buildings came down, both theories need more work.

So what limits us from exploring space really, what traps us in our little bubble of space?

Our biology!

So hypothetically let’s say aliens definitely exist or have existed, reaching our complexity in some state. Let’s say they also faced the same problems with large space, not being able to travel because of a limited biology

So in order to really explore outer worlds we would have to transcend our biology. Go from biological to a merging of biology and technology, let’s call it symbiotic 

Let’s make logic a constant, that logic will always push forward in a step wise manor everywhere, anywhere

What if other Aliens follow the same logical path of development as us, and sought to transcend their own biology in order to go beyond the veil of their respective universe

We talk about the dangers of becoming something completely new, post human. What if through losing what we are, we also lose what we want. 

That the Fermi paradox is because of the symbiotic step in evolution, we think 🤔 💭 “we want to explore” but by the time you change that far, that goal may no longer make any sense. 

We say that we could just end in a black hole, but what what if it’s not that simple. Instead of  simply being a self destruction type of thing, what if we had a choice in the end. What if it’s a revelation in understanding we can’t dream of that keeps aliens from conquering our space

So let’s say complex aliens are highly likely due to the fact we exist, If we happened so did they.

I think this idea of free will, and exploration from sea to shining sea might go hand &amp; hand. That once we reach a state of say idk maybe transcendental enlightenment or what ever the fuck understanding that would defeat the idea of leaving our bubble. 

Maybe they realize it’s not possible, or they see a higher truth, like possibly that we’re all stuck in our respective space or some higher truth that we can’t begin to imagine. 

Maybe they choose to exit into their own universe, so they make a black hole which leads to a new white hole(Big Bang). Or that that’s the only way to a new world, a new space they can conquer.

Maybe the space you initially occupy can’t be conquered by you, so you develop your own space. 

My problem with this thought is that it leads to the tortoise scenario, wouldn’t our universe be someone’s new space to conquer, or maybe our space is already conquered, maybe matter and everything we come to call our universe is that thing (so alien to us that we can’t even see that it’s alien anymore) conquering space. Or could be way outside our scale of sight, a mega brain we can’t see from the inside

What if every new universe that gets conquered by its respective alien ancestor/creator is so alien, that life in that universe would never see it as alien. It would just be it’s universe, idk if you get my logic here, but what I’m trying to say is maybe this is the endless cycle of existence/logic. Existence propagates an entirely new alien existence, so alien to the prior existence that it can never understand what it came from, so on so on so forth

I’m trying to figure out where the aliens either went/how the loop of universal creation could work.

So Aliens become self aware-&gt; seek to explore-&gt; further develop to symbiotic level-&gt; reach new understanding (that they can’t conquer their universe, so they create their own universe)-&gt;black hole-&gt; new universe-&gt; some new from of sentience becomes aware again within that conquered space-&gt; that new sentience can’t see that their universe is already conquered-&gt; seek to explore-&gt; symbiotic level-&gt; understanding-&gt; black
Hole-&gt; so on so forth

We think the universe is so grand but it probably is just one small grain of sand in a never ending beach. Only seems big because it’s where we start, every alien society logically takes the same steps in understandings. I think these steps in understanding are universal no matter how different alien can be. That logic is the only prevailing universal truth that works through every universe in the endless 🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢

We feel special, therefore we are special! But special because no other alien life will every be like us, that every alien life is to alien to other aliens. I cease to believe that we’re special universally, I just think we’re unique, like another alien replica would be anything like another. Every repeating form of sentience is special because it’s unique",The universe is Alien

aliens," 

ok i have a theory...........it does not discount the Bible that is true.

Jesus always said he was the Son of Man and also I am who you say I am.

What do we know that is true. Science says for every action there is an equal to opposite reaction and also there is cause and effect....These are known as LAWS. they cannot be broken.

What If....All of mankind worked together to find a Separate Space outside of time you would have to build ""heaven"" but at that point mankind appointed Jesus to do it. Where no body ever dies cause of the pain and misery it causes. The Bible mentions All of mankind united there is nothing that they cannot do.

God is Love.

Jesus was the Son of Pure Love created eventually by mankind, at which point everybody was in agreement that He is the Leader of all mankind. Jewish People insert here....The Chosen people of the Bible.

Life is a Circle my grandfather told me that after discussing how did you know what to do when you didn't have anyone to look to to see how they did it.

I'm guessing far far into the future here.  
No i'm not God just a thinker.  
Towards the end of Jesus Natural Born life science had advanced so far that we had figured out how to take his Brain or soul as we say it and send it back in time to Mary for the virgin birth of Jesus. But before that He was with God with the Word of God in the beginning. In the beginning was God and God was the word and the word was with God.

He was a product of the Word of God. True.  
He was a man that had reached ""enlightenment"" as a Buddhist would say.  
He was given all authority over all beings. True.

If God is Love....  
The 10 Commandments would be the law of God, the commandments are but a way to sustain Life, mankind finally figured it out at some point. But driven by the fear of dying.

There is No other name given below heaven for a man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. True.

How about we show love to everyone in the name of Jesus. It's not about judgment from us, God has already decided on the Judge. Cause we finally figured it out.

History tells us we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over and over if we don't do something to fix it.

What if Jesus who called himself the son of man was true, think about it.

His Job is Judgement. Not ours. The only way to live forever is Jesus.

I say this is a theory....i'm not claiming it is correct or anything just typing what i think.

Mankind is working on artificial intelligence as we speak....  
How did i come to the knowledge of the Bible??? Through Love.... It was a Gift that was gifted to me. What if life is nothing more than a Gift created out of love by man at the end of this age...and we figured out through trial and error how to do it. This would also include time travel not for everyone but only for the ""Son of Man"" who was appointed to save the world.

The only way any of this could happen is if you work your but off for Jesus. Not about you....its about bringing heaven to earth...

If life is a circle....Science also tells us that life has to come from Life.

Why are you running from the truth?",What if???

aliens,"When I was a kid (I’m now 62) I remember reading a serialized story that was in the summer vacation version of The Weekly Reader.  It started out with a young boy who was spending his summer vacation on his grandparent’s farm.  One night he’s awakened by a strange noise and looks out the window to see what he assumes is a meteor crashing just over the hill from his grandparent’s farmhouse.  He goes to check it out and discovers a disc-shaped craft in the top of his grandfather’s apple tree.  As he’s standing there, he hears a noise behind him and turning around finds an alien kid hanging upside down by his knees from a branch of the apple tree.  The alien kid has pointed ears that fold down when he sleeps.  They become friends and spend the entire summer having adventures together.  At the end of the summer the alien kid leaves, and the human kid has to go back to school.

The Weekly Reader was a kind of subscription publication that came once a week in the (snail) mail.  As I said the story was serialized and the cool part was that new stories always corresponded with the actual real world timeline (i.e. summer vacation just started, 4th of July, almost time to go back to school, etc.).

Anyway, my question is, does anyone remember this?  I’ve scoured the internet to no avail.  I’m starting to think that maybe this is one of those really cool things that are unfortunately forever lost.

Anyone who comes up with a link, or anything, will have earned my everlasting gratitude.

aliens,"Snooop was on Twitter and posted some interesting pics and videos. Picture after picture after picture. Never spoke really, you'd ask him a question, and he'd respond with another picture. Once in a while he would give a short response, typically ""I don't remember,"" when asked about the events in the pics he posted. He would post to different UFO accounts trying to show his pics. Unfortunately, he got a one week suspension after being accused of spam. He came back on after the suspension and stopped posting his pics to the UFO outlets. He simply posted to the public at large. He started posting videos (none of which I was able to save). One I saw had him driving down a country road in the UK somewhere. A small object flying at incredible speed zipped right in front of his windshield. 

He had one pic I did not save that had a woman in the passenger seat and something resembling a grey standing outside the car. 

One day, he posted a picture of a Chinook Helicopter. I didn't save it, couldn't have been more than 30min since I saw the pic of the Chinook. I went to his twitter account and it originally said I was blocked. I was shocked and wondered if I did something wrong. But then I checked later...his account had been suspended. He had 0 followers and 0 following. 

I have no idea what happened to Snooop. I hope he's ok, and hope I can see more pictures someday.

These are his pics, not mine. But they're copies of what I could save. I wish I had saved more. He had a ton of them.

Some of the mysteries surrounding Padre Pio, including stigmata are difficult if not impossible to explain away, indicating something is going on, but not necessarily what religious people choose to believe.

https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2017/11/did-padre-pio-or-other-alleged-mystics.html

I'm not aware of any direct evidence tying Padre Pio to Ancient Aliens; however there may be some indirect evidence, since he's part of a pattern of behavior from many unexplained mystics, including Helena Blavatsky, Andrew Jackson Davis, Joseph Smith, and some mystics or events that were directly tied to UFOs, including Jose Arigo, Uri Geller, and especially the alleged ""Miracle of the Sun"" at Fatima, which appears far more like the largest UFO sighting in history than a religious event, and may indicate a connection between religion and UFOs or Ancient Aliens.

&amp;#x200B;

Padre Pio Allegedly had ties to the incident at Fatima; when a statue was brought from there to his hometown he was sick and claimed to have been miraculously cured.

This might add to evidence that he's influenced by an unknown advanced intelligence. However, it wouldn't have been a higher moral authority, since that would have communicated honestly, in a way people could understand.

He also preached blind obedience to authority, at a time when this was very dangerous, and contributed to atrocities during World War II.

Pio claimed to oppose Hitler and Mussolini, but his preaching of blind obedience helped give them support, and his own leaders that he recommended people trust supported both.

aliens,"This is a crazy train of thought but I’m in no way saying this is real I just thought it was a fun theory.
I’ve been watching a lot about cults and the most obvious thing is the control factor. Jonestown, how did so many people kill themselves ‘willingly’ for this man? Keep em poor, keep em tired and they’ll never leave. We are so controlled to think and act a certain way that the idea of Freewill can only go so far. We’d do anything to protect our planet right? We give up so much without even realising it. So from an outside of a cult perspective we think god I wish we could save them, or if they only knew what was happening and what their life could really be like. I’ll stop there because I don’t want this post to be a mammoth. But what if this entire world was a cult. We might seem big but compared to the rest of the universe, we are nothing. Imagine there was a very known world out there that we were being kept from. To the rest of the universe it’s no secret that you can fly from planet to planet and go as far as your brain can imagine. There are all kinds of walks of life which isn’t hard to imagine, we might be the only humans but there are thousands of species out there on this planet. What if the people in the universe know ‘Earth’ is a sheltered cult or society like the way we viewed Jonestown or North Korea. Maybe they come to observe or protect us as much as they can? Maybe we need to be self aware in order to be free? If we are told you’re in a cult, you’re being brainwashed? That’s the worst thing you can tell a cult member, so maybe the universe is waiting for the day we finally figure it out oh our own? Until then they will drop by just to make sure we’re all okay for the most part so much that don’t yet feel like they need to intervene.

What I can remember:

- The video was allegedly taken when it was dark.

- It was in an area with lots of vegitation.

- The object viewed appeared to be close to the observer, very rough estimate of 200 feet away?

- Object appeared in a clearing with less vegitation.

- Object appeared to be large (a rough estimate of the size of a 2 bedroom house)

- Object was shaped like a pie dish

- Object had many blue lights coming from the sides and bottom.

- You could see what looked like things moving, sillouetted by the blue lights inside near some openings.

- Object was either on the ground of maybe a few feet off the ground.

- Video was shot with a side portfolio of the object.

- I found the video on youtube 10 years ago.

[Source: https:\/\/www.thedebrief.org\/leaked-photo-surfaces-of-purported-unidentified-aerial-phenomena\/](https://preview.redd.it/15dzgexyk8361.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccc27d7fe1ff6444fdb75c381f5b3fdd924b163)

The most prominent prevailing debunk is that it is a 28inch foil Mylar Balloon of the variety used in themed Batman kiddo birthday parties (picture down bottom).

Yet nobody is talking about the elephant in the room...The UFO was snapped at an altitude of at least 60k ft-70k ft where jets such as the FA-18 typically hit Mach II @ 1.53k mph.A Mylar balloon at this altitude would have blown up already via lack of air pressure.    


Mylar balloons do not go higher than about 3,000 feet to 7,000 feet before they either explode or lose their “lift.” This is because of their inability to expand to any great extent.  
( Ref. [https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/weather/weather-watch/article39489087.html#:\~:text=However%2C%20Mylar%20balloons%20do%20not,expand%20to%20any%20great%20extent](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/weather/weather-watch/article39489087.html#:~:text=However%2C%20Mylar%20balloons%20do%20not,expand%20to%20any%20great%20extent) )

Let's say a the Mylar Balloon is specially designed to be able to have space for expansion, even then it will only be able to get to a maximum of 26.4k feet.  
( Ref. [https://www.wvnews.com/sports/outdoors/reasons-to-ban-helium-filled-balloons/article\_81742604-4b97-57f6-a082-2f007cfdf46b.html](https://www.wvnews.com/sports/outdoors/reasons-to-ban-helium-filled-balloons/article_81742604-4b97-57f6-a082-2f007cfdf46b.html) )

That's not saying it doesn't have a conventional explanation.Given the perspective of a professional commercial pilot on Twitter also, the object must be vast in size.   
( Ref. [https://twitter.com/MiddleOfMayhem/status/1334672334964191232](https://twitter.com/MiddleOfMayhem/status/1334672334964191232) )

On a lighter note, when I first saw the photo, I immediately grinned thinking ""Yeah, that looks like the kind of ship those Predator aliens would fly!!""

So, what are y'alls opinion on this..?

Here's the purported culprit balloon... (Note that in the UFO photo, the object has angled lateral distance to the side, which the below does not)...

I put it to the community that over the last year we have had arguably a lot of “insiders” shall we say come out and discuss the ET topic.

We’ve had hoaxes, potential CIA employees, x Area 51 employees etc etc.

I know scepticism can be frustrating for the most open minded person but I think we need to remember people like Snowden. 

The reason for this is because Snowden disclosed extremely sensitive information along with documentation and was very very close to being locked up and potentially executed.

Documents such as the Wilson leaks, user 5c_attica posts and others have disclosed information arguably more sensitive than mass surveillance with that said I think we need as a community to think before getting into debates on documents and random posts.

I put it to the community that imagine Snowden logged onto Reddit and disclosed mass surveillance even without the documents what do you think would have happened? If you agree he would have been locked up then can you imagine the consequences of disclosed ET info with all the SAP programs out there.

It was several years ago but I think about it so often. I was standing in the driveway while my Mum who was  chatting to my Godparents. It was like one of those 45 minute goodbyes. I was staring up at the sky and was mesmerised but how clear the night was and how bright the stars were. I spotted what I thought was a satellite or a shooting star but it was doing something really odd. It was moving in a zigzag pattern across a section of the night sky. The same kind of pattern you'd use to search the ocean floor for wreckage or something. 

Once it completed searching an area of the sky it shot off at an incredible speed to another section and again did this same zigzag pattern. The distance it was covering was astounding and the speed at which it turned couldn't have been any modern aircraft that I know of.

I watched it for about a minute before whacking my older brother on the arm to have a look. We both watched it for another 30 seconds or more and even had time to try and debunk what we were watching. Then suddenly it zoomed off and was gone. 

We live near a light aircraft airport but are ages away from any naval or air force bases. I really have no idea what it was doing but it moved with purpose.",What were they looking for?

So one night a couple of months ago, I was laying in bed watching TV. I wasn't sleepy, just relaxing and winding down from work. My boyfriend was watching with me, until he got up to go to the bathroom. I paused the show we were watching and I was scrolling on my phone waiting for him to come back. 
I had my bedside table on so the room was lit in a relaxing low light -- the room wasn't dark by any means. 

Suddenly I hear this weird humming/buzzing sound. It sounded like it was coming over my house, and it was almost like I could feel it. I put my phone down and concentrated on the sound. For reference, I live in rural Ohio so I don't live near a freeway or anything like that. It's basically farm land and Amish for miles. My boyfriend was taking forever in the bathroom and I wished he would hurry back so we could talk about this noise. 

The noise was constant, and I started to feel a weird pressure in my head. It felt similar to that pressure that builds up when you're flying, and you can't get your ears to pop. It felt really concentrated in my forehead -- I hadn't experienced a sensation like it before. 

I feel really relaxed and almost sedated, and at this point my boyfriend walks into the room, gets into bed and lays down facing the wall. It was weird because we had just been watching TV, and we were right in the middle of an episode. I turn to look at him and he's practically laying face down. 

When I turn to look back towards my door to make sure he closed it (can't let the cat out) I saw a short alien standing in my room near my desk. It was shorter than the chair, so maybe 3-3.5ft max in height. It's skin was milky white, and had no wrinkles or creases. No ears that I could see. It was wearing a silver outfit, which sounds stereotypical, but it's the truth. 

Immediately my heart started pounding hard. It hurt and I thought I might have a heart attack because I went from totally relaxed to intense panic. I tried to move my arm to get my boyfriend's attention but it was numb. I could barely feel my hand, but I felt his hair, so I grabbed it and tried to pull it as hard as I could. He turned over, looked in the direction of the alien, and turned right back to face the wall. His body started shaking really bad like he was shivering, but then he went calm again like he was sleeping. 

I looked back toward the alien and it was still just standing there. 
I stared at it really hard, trying to soak in all the details I could since there was nothing else I could really do. I wanted to remember everything and not be so scared that I would repress it. 
I've had some practice with meditation and mindfulness, so I slowed my breathing and decided there was no real reason to feel fear. 

My heart slowed a bit and I was still scared, but I wanted to be in control of my reaction. As I looked at it, I thought it had really tiny eyes, but suddenly it opened them and they were totally black. The things I thought were eyes must have been the tiny tear duct, but there was no crease for the lid. 

At this point it must have realized I was watching it and aware of it, because it jumped in my face somehow. Suddenly it was as if it was on top of me, but I didn't feel any weight. I couldn't really feel my body at all though, so I'm not sure if that's why. 

This next part is really weird, but it started to shake it's head really fast. It was moving it so fast my vision started to blur. Imagine the tail of a rattlesnake. This really scared me and all of my mindfulness went out the window. I think I blacked out from fear because the next thing I know it's morning. 

My boyfriend doesn't remember anything and didn't want to really talk about it. We were watching a show, he went to the bathroom, then suddenly we go to sleep? It would be unusual for us to stop in the middle of the show, and to leave the TV on, etc. 

The whole experience probably only lasted about 5 minutes tops. 

I know a lot of people will write this off. That's fine because I understand that until you have your own experience you're not likely to believe anything like this. For the people that have had their own experiences, please share them with me. 

I've had experiences as a kid. Up until this past year I thought it might be a dream. 

This incident occurred about a week, week and a half before I saw a ""boomerang"" shaped UFO fly directly over my car. I made a post about that the day after it happened.

 Nothing major has happened since these experiences. I have seen some green lights over my house, but that's it. 

For anyone that has had such a close encounter, did they keep happening? Did you have a bunch of experiences in quick succession?

I'm really hoping that my boyfriend can experience something more fully, because at this point he hasn't been ""fully present"".

aliens,"2 days ago my mother stopped by my place to tell me about a strange dream she had. This was pretty odd behaviour for her as she very very rarely remembers her dreams and is a very private person in general.  This one dream however - was so clear in her mind that she just *had* to tell me about it. 

My mother dreamt that I lived far out in the bush, practically the middle of no where in a hand built log cabin. I had returned to my parents home before the first snowfall to collect everything I’d need for the winter, as I explained that there were no accessible roads to my place once the snow hit. 
After shopping with my parents 
I packed up all the groceries and supplies into my truck to leave, and then I rolled down the window to say goodbye to my parents. Right before I leave the driveway I lean my head out the window and say one final thing: “I almost forgot to tell you. My cabin is in the Bermuda Triangle.”  I smile a huge smile, and I drive off. 
My mom wakes up. 

Now, this dream was very intriguing to me, as my ultimate “dream” in waking life has always been to live in a cabin in the wilderness. off grid style. I also thought it was interesting I mentioned the Bermuda Triangle as I’ve always been super fascinated with the “unknown” “mysteries” “alien theories” ect. I didn’t think much about it until the next morning when I woke up from a weird dream aswell.

I dreamt that it was the *end of the world*. I don’t know how I knew it was the end, but I *knew*. People were panicking on the streets and the sky was a very strange purple ish red colour. People were being herded like sheep into military style busses and evacuating the premises. As my family approached the bus, I realized I didn’t have my ID or ticket. My mom then got hysterical, realizing I wouldn’t be able to go with them without it. I promised her I’d meet her wherever her bus stops and not to worry about me. I took multiple other busses and trains that were severely packed with people, to meet my family at the “airport.” This was not a conventional airport, as there were hundreds of “space planes” being boarded with people. Eventually I was seated (behind my mom) on the plane and we took off into space. I remember the rumble as we left the earths atmosphere into space. I remember thinking “wow.. we’re actually in space!! There’s earth!!” And I woke up. 

I thought this was a strange dream, wrote it down as usual, and moved on with my day. That night I had yet another very strange dream: 

I dreamt that I was walking with my mom along a waterfront. It was night and the moon was completely full. We were having a good time talking and walking until I looked up at the moon and saw a strange shape start to cover it. I start yelling “Look! Look hurry! Look at the moon! What is that?” A weird and unnatural shape started to cover the moon from left to right (kind of like an eclipse but not a perfect circle shape) Once she saw what I was talking about she was practically traumatized with fear. Suddenly a small dot appeared next to the moon, which I immediately called a “UFO”
As soon as the word “UFO” slips from my mouth these half red half aqua glowing spheres start shooting out of the UFO towards the ground. They make a loud rumbling sound like a plane passing overhead, and then a huge “boom” sound as they crash into the earth and displace dirt and debris. My mom at this point is crying and running as fast as she can, but I feel frozen. I feel curious about what is falling from the sky and feel very drawn to the one that is closest to me. As I approach it, it bursts into the most beautiful bright colours. This was kind of like fireworks, but not quite. It was otherworldly. It was colours and swirls of beauty and “stars”. Most notably the colour that I found the prettiest was a bright aqua teal ish colour. My mom kept screaming at me to look away from the light, but I could barely pry my eyes away because it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. I woke up. 

Now, these dreams might not seem all that strange to you. But they all happened consecutively. Now let’s add in another strange part: 

My mother as a child had a very terrifying “UFO encounter.” She hates to speak of it, but I’ve heard the story many times, and it strikes some uncanny similarities between my dreams. Sure this could be coincidence. But I think there is more at play here. I’ve got multiple journals filled with “alien/space/UFO” dreams. Would love to try hypnotherapy to extract some of these memories, but chances of that coming along is pretty much none.
