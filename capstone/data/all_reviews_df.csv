There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).Cons1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.

40,4.0,"Great for FTE, contractors beware!","First of all, amazing tech stack, great engineers, interesting projects, more knowledge and resources available than you can handle. You have to learn all the time and not stick to some specific stack as there's constant development and deprecation going on. Not the environment for everybody but if you have a boy-scout attitude you will be happy there. I am for this part.For the organizational aspects it's not great though. A lot of chaotic changes happened just so that someone can have a great performance evaluation to jump to another team after which the project is forgotten (I've seen it happen many times). It's amazing how many resources are wasted for meaningless work. It's sad to see engineers taking over management tasks from incompetent managers just to get work done.For the cultural part, don't be fooled - it's not the same open and inclusive company as it used to be. People get fired for saying the ugly truth. The hierarchy is much more enforced than it used to be (in my org tree). Make sure you work there as a full-time employee (FTE) and not let's say a contractor. If you're a contractor like me, doing the same full-time engineering work as my FTE peers and for many years just on different contract (but same NDAs), prepare for getting different treatment. This is sad especially that the majority of the workforce are contractors/vendors etc. Some examples:- I need to pass some security trainings annually which say that contractors/temps/vendors are trouble and a security threat. - I receive a lot of company-wide communication inviting me to events and trainings - more...","amazing tech stack, constantly learning new things, good salary",[]

53,5.0,"Overall great company, smart people and great benefits","WFH at the moment with the option to go into the office. Good amount of time with clients but way too many internal meetings. Self promotion and side projects are keys to success, not necessarily your day to day tasks. Many opportunities to learn and network and you can fill that in with other trainings on diversity and personal growth. Culture varies by team, but for the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help. Total opposite of 'cut-throat.' However, that also breeds some complacency.Hardest part of the job sometimes is staying motivated because there's little incentive to keep pushing at times. Loads of filler meetings where nothing gets accomplished. Best part is work/life balance, benefits and team culture. Worst part is up-leveling your position in the company (management track is non-existent), the promotion process (only getting harder and longer for long time Googlers), and the inability to obtain more money (no room to ask for a 'raise' as it's all done algorithmically and even in sales it's fairly difficult to blow your quota out of the water, albeit you will usually hit your goals or come close).","Free lunches, cell phone reimbursement, gym reimbursement, great 401K match, backdoor 401K eligibility, solid WLB, global reset days (days off), very smart colleagues, management that seemingly cares about you as a person. 3 days in office, 2 days home.",[]

The management swore at me and the team constantly, gave timelines on projects that did not take any consideration of weekends, holidays, etc. We are not allowed to ‘speak to Googlers’ (these exact words are used) - we are only allowed to speak to our recruitment agency, but Googlers are allowed to speak to as in any way they want, when they so wish. We cannot complain, we do not get any benefits. Since the pandemic we have worked from home and we got nothing to help us. No budget for desks, no budget for extra screens. No questions of how we were doing. I have never in my career experiences worse treatment of human beings in a workplace and I am very happy that I can find a job elsewhere.

There is little to no flexibility, especially when asking for time-off. There is basically no support from managers expect to meet job quotas and contractors are severely underpaid compared to their full-time employed co-workers who do literally the same job. And no matter what, don't trust recruiters when they say conversion is possible. Seriously, with the recent re-orgs and budget changes, head-count availability changes almost daily. I've seen contractors either laid off after their contract ends or pushed to become a vendor so there's less limitations on how long they can work at Google. On the bright side, they are implementing a standard for contractors to get some more benefits from their hiring companies, can't say if this affects the hourly wage as I've left a while ago in search for better pay.","Free lunch, promise of better benefits for contractors",[]

As such, we had to hire folks from other parts of Google, as well as get ""buddies"" within Google to help review our code.

I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head. I saw excessive amounts of waste at every turn. Corporate culture is one of laziness and complacency, to the point where trying to pick up extra work that is technically beyond the scope of your job title will actually penalize you. I had to argue for weeks to convince a senior engineer to make a one line, basic change to top of rack switch because he simply didn't want to do it, and there was literally no recourse for me (I quit before he did, if he ever did). There are also some really sketchy activity going on inside, and attempts at bringing said activity to light will most likely only end poorly for you. Overall, it started off great when I was still enamored by the name ""Google"" and was but a lowly peon. But as my team members quickly quit and my responsibilities expanded to encompass their old duties (because hiring for your team is also a nightmare), I saw more and more of the grit beneath the glamor.

During my first few months at Google I learned a ton from internal resources and learning about their technical infrastructure.+ Overall good culture of transparency, giving voice to employees, and trying to make sure employees are happy.+ Good compensation. Cons:Google is huge, and this has a number of consequences. For one, many engineering teams move very slowly. Lots of red tape, and lots of huge systems to integrate with. Very deep management chains. For an individual contributor, decisions may be made many levels above you and you have very little input or context. Depending on the team, it can be hard to have meaningful impact at Google. Some systems are so old they are already fully optimized, others are just so large that you're unlikely to touch more than a small piece or sub system. Most engineers at Google aren't solving the worlds hardest/funnest problems--their just manning the ship, making sure things don't break and adding small incremental improvements.

I am a vendor, and overall I will say have been treated well, and with kindness and respect. My only real issue is that despite many years working there, it's very hard to be made from a vendor to a permanent employee, and there is little room for advancement. If you are a TVC, you'll have to remember that overall, that is the case. Unless you are excellent at what you do and happen to be at the right place at the right time, you'll probably do best to work there, get a solid reputation and skillset, and then use the Google name to go somewhere else.

Whether you come in as a contractor or a permanent employee, you definitely will get the experience of a lifetime.  With that being said.. I do feel like contractors (known as TVCs) are treated differently. I still think there is an overall great culture, but I wish they gave TVCs some of the resources they give permanent employees. Part of the reason I'm open to other opportunities is that there really isn't a clear path to conversion, the line is pretty blurred. Not to mention you have to re-interview for it. Google loves people that ""thrive in ambiguity"" but as a TVC it's a little concerning when you don't have much guidance on how to push for conversion. You are essentially doing the exact same job as permanent employees, but apart from good numbers they want to see other intangibles to really have a strong case for conversion. Some of the top performers on my team were TVCs but unfortunately are not at Google anymore because they didn't make it through the conversion process. Would I take this job as a TVC again? Probably. I admire this company and love how much you grow as a professional. I am definitely still gonna give the conversion process a shot, but I'm also realistic and know I need to be keeping my options open.","Culture, Great Food, Great Ammenities, Great Work/Life Balance, Great people",[]

For managers of product, process, projects or of people you often have to ""create your job"", and maintain a high-performance image. You are told to do this by building your internal resume. And you should, always noting your ""impact"". You need to define your role and make sure your manager and your stakeholders understand it and agree.  You may think hear you have the charter to blaze a new trail, but you need to be careful, there is a lot of coopetition, and some people would like to see you fail. Some people are guarding their territory and they don't think they need to align with your new process or whatever - and they don't . It's a tough place for a new ""expert"" type who's charter involves change. Do a lot of listening, and find ways to align with people and pick their brain. Ask questions. And travel to meet remote people you need to work with, in person, with an agenda. The Compensation/Benefits are good. Some positions and in some teams you need to be politically adept. The culture in many teams is not exactly friendly, especially if some external perceptions of the team are negative - it can feel a bit paranoid.

1507,4.0,Contractor,"As a contractor I worked at Mountain View and also on the YouTube Ads project in San Bruno.   The former was excellent, with an excellent supervisor.  The contract was supposed to last one year and went two.  Very happy.I learned much from the other programmers and engineers (both Google employees and fellow contractors).  The ergonomics of my desk and chair were excellent.  The lighting is a bit harsh and the air quality was terrible on the weekends.  I am used to an office and it was really weird sitting across from someone and when you looked up they might be staring back. Just weird! Now, that was the good one.  Following that, I worked in San Bruno on the YouTube Red project.  It was extremely annoying and we were treated poorly.  At YouTube our supervisor was terrible.  I can honestly say she was the worst manager I've ever worked for.  Blamed us for her lack of procedure and disorganization.  Instead of real coding (and Graphics as promised) we spent our days and sometimes nights trying to modify an often broken and bizarre script-based system.  We couldn't even get access to fix the broken parts!  Super annoying.  I would work in Mountain View in a heartbeat.  San Bruno and YouTube - never again.  Stay away if you cherish your mental health.     Finally, a bit of a warning, for older engineers and contractors: expect to be left out of the culture.  If you have a thin skin this might bug you. I didn't bother me much though and now and again, at Mountain View, I was often invited to events by my supervisor that really weren't supposed to be for contractors. - more...","Free food, intelligent people.

This is down to the expectation of working large amounts of unpaid overtime, very sharp elbows and strange management styles.

The workplace varied depending on what store you were stationed at for the day or week, which could change at any given day/time. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet our delivery window when orders were flowing in, basically like a rush hour, and not being able to communicate with a boss or someone who should be over the whole store operators, not just leads.

Plus you can catch a really healthy and delicious breakfast. Other than a bit of posturing from teammates mostly from Ivy schools at the beginning, everyone is respectful and friendly. Engineering is a clear favorite in the company though management receive high compensation as well. Meetings are frequent but brief. People are expected to do more than the standard. That's what the perks are for I believe. The environment is comfortable so try to outperform and bring in more value for their cost (your compensation).  If I had to be picky, the only cons I experienced were (coming from smaller companies) that even if you were proficient in another area, you often couldn't apply it because roles are more strictly defined at a large company such as Google. There are security and policy procedures that limit access. I read elsewhere that some people found some employees to be arrogant. I found that to be the rare minority. Even in those cases, if you prove yourself good at what you do, you win respect. When I started, I came from a state college and 80% of my team were Harvard grads. They did their clique-y thing on occasion. But they didn't realize I went to state university because my family wasn't well off, and I dropped my GPA at the end pursuing athletic and gaming competitions on a national level.

The Management Team is highly technical, they could provide feedback for challenging solutions and guidance on how to wrangle them.  Google's workplace culture is collaborative but highly competitive, you always need to bring you ""A"" game on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was trying to manage work life, as the demands for getting projects completed on time were paramount.

Its a very good place to be.However, as a contractor, the company's actions make it clear they do not care about you at all. You don't have any job security, so you don't know if you'll be there in 6 months and you can only be there a maximum of 2 years regardless how much your team values you (unless there is budgetary miracle). There are regular meetings and  off-site events for team building that you are not invited to, which has rather the opposite effect. It doesn't matter how inclusive or devoted to psychological security your culture is if half the employees don't have job security. And the people on the ground know its is terrible but the practice persists for economic reasons (since contractors cost about half what full employees do). Like as a contractor I was not invited to the holiday party, but full time employees that couldn't go would give their invites to contractors; so the employees would work around company policies to mitigate that damage to morale and tea-mates. It was a weird disconnect. But like I said, Google is a great place to work, you'll meet great people, work on very interesting things, and have opportunities you don't have anywhere else.

1988,5.0,"Great place to start as a TVC, not so good to stay","Google is a wonderful place to work, I wish I never left! As a TVC though, your experience is greatly dependent on what agency you are with. If your agency is timid about asking for more money so that in turn, YOU can continue to climb then you're out of luck. Everyone is pretty collaborative, easy going but hard working. My experience as a TVC was that they didn't care how or when you did something, as long as it was done and on time. You do have to get used to requests from FTE's that can seem frantic, I.E. ""I need this YESTERDAY HELP ME PLEASE!"" but if you can communicate and ease fears of trusting a TVC to complete a task, then you'll do well. Engineers there, both software and hardware, tend to lack communication skills or emotional intelligence so if you can bring that to the role then you'll be greatly appreciated. You get almost all of the same perks like free gym access and food however you do have to pay $1.50 each way on the G Bus shuttles whereas this is free to FTEs. All FTE shopping perks, concerts and happy hours are not extended to TVCs but its not that big of a deal. Overall, great place to be with the RIGHT agency.","Free meals, free gym access, great work/life balance and culture.",[]
1989,5.0,Amazing place but caste system,"Google is an amazing place to work.  However, there is a distinct caste system among employees. · Full-time employees are all treated great.· Full-time contractors are treated very well, with most of the same benefits as FTEs, but on fixed-term contracts.· Temp/Vendor/Contractors are treated well for non-monetary benefits - ie free shuttles, free food, free use of gym & laundry facilities; no insurance, stock options, bonuses, etc. This is fairly common practice in Silicon Valley.  However, it is the fact that the distinctions between these 3 categories are often blurred, but the TVCs are treated as disposable in a lot of ways. There is the obvious incentive to work hard as a TVC to earn a promotion to FTC or FTE, but often that path is not transparent and in fact it may be used as an incentive or motivation, when, in actuality, there is no actual path to promotion.","free food, free laundry facilities, free gym facilities, free shuttle service, great HR coverage",[]

Google also refunds for your  internet connection at home and provides a 19 inch monitor to work at home. What more could one ask for.",,[]
1993,5.0,Worst hiring process I have ever seen,"Google is not a bad place to work if you get in; however, google has the worst hiring process of any company I have ever seen.  The absolute debilitating fear of accidentally hiring the wrong person creates an environment where there is a long winded hiring black box, with almost no feedback what so ever.  You might be in communication with a hiring manager one week getting ready for interviews, and the next week, you are no longer being considered, with no explanation, and having not even interviewed.  Once you have made it through the notoriously difficult 4 hour back to back interviews, there begins a long mysterious process of going through hiring committees and executive reviews, where there is no feedback.  This process took at least a month or more for me, with a solid month between phone and in person interviews,  There was also a delay of a couple months between resume submission and any contact from Google. Once in to Google, being awesome at your job is not quite good enough to get you promoted.  You need to demonstrate being awesome at the position two levels above you, to be considered for promo.",,[]
